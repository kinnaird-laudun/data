## TED Talks under Creative Commons License

**Commercial cases:**  Using a TED Talk in a commercial context (on an intranet system, at a company event, in training materials, within a TED-branded video offering or editorial program, and more), requires a license. Please fill out our  [media licensing request form](https://media-requests.ted.com/)  to inquire about licensing TED content. Read more below about bringing TED Talks to for-profit companies.

**Non-commercial cases:** We encourage you to share TED Talks that are licensed for distribution under our Creative Commons license, Attribution–Non Commercial–No Derivatives (or the CC BY – NC – ND 4.0 International) which means it may be shared by  [following a few requirements](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) . Certain TED Talks that are licensed to TED such as performances and or other talks that we have shared but not created may not be distributed.

* **Attribute TED as the owner of the TED Talk** and include a link to the talk, but do not include any text that shows TED endorses your website or platform.
* **Do not use the TED site content for any commercial purposes,** for sale, sublicense or in an app of any kind for any advertising, or in exchange for payment of any kind.
* **You cannot remix, create derivative work or modify** the TED site content in any way.
* **You may not add any further more restrictions** that we have provided to the TED site content, such as additional legal restrictions, or charge any fees or technological restrictions to accessing the content.

**Embedding TED Talks on your blog or site:**

* **Type of site_company:_**_ Bloggers, news_information websites and nonprofits (by which we mean: registered 501©3 organizations in the United States, and the equivalent in all other countries), may share one or more TED Talks under a Creative Commons (CC) license, provided that they follow the rest of the guidelines on this page and sharing the TED Talks is not the central purpose of your site. This means that we expect the usage under Creative Commons to be one to share ideas, not to use TED Talks as the main content for your site, which provides revenue or other sources of income that relies on content we are providing. If you are interested in licensing TED Talks for other purposes, or for more regular usage, please contact us for more details.

* **Transcripts and subtitles** may be used under the same Creative Commons license in conjunction with the TED Talk video. Copyright on the transcripts is owned by TED and any edits, different usage rights or changes to these documents are not permitted without permission. Thus, if you wanted to publish a TED Talk in a book, test, play, or otherwise, for any other publication, permission is required.
