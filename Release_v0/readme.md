# About the Data (Release 0)

Katherine M. Kinnaird and John Laudun (Citation information below.)

The files in this folder are the data files released as part of the paper, "TED talks as Data," submitted to the _Journal of Cultural Analyics_. The first of which is the exported CSV (from a Google sheet) of a list of TED talks maintained by anonymous authors. (More information on the Google sheet and how we used it are in the paper.) The remaining CSV files are the four collated data files.

For working files described in Section 3 of the paper, please see the `speakers_work` directory. For the associated Jupyter Notebooks, please check the `data` directory (which is the parent directory to this one). Please note that the Jupyter notebooks in the data directory should be considered historical in nature: while the code in them can be run, in some cases input and output files have subsequently been moved and/or renamed as our own processes and priorities became clearer to us. We welcome their use: just know they may not run as-is.
