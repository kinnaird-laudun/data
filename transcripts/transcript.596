											I&#39;d like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago
											while writing an article for Italian Wired.
											I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I&#39;m writing anything,
											but I&#39;d already finished editing the piece,
											and I realized that I had never once in my life
											looked up the word &quot;disabled&quot; to see what I&#39;d find.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Let me read you the entry.
											&quot;Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,
											stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,
											run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,
											senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in
											cracked-up, counted-out;
											see also hurt, useless and weak.
											Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable.&quot;
											I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,
											it was so ludicrous,
											but I&#39;d just gotten past &quot;mangled,&quot; and my voice broke,
											and I had to stop and collect myself
											from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.
									</p>

									<p>
											You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus
											so I&#39;m thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?
											But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,
											when I would have been starting primary school
											and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit
											and as related to the other kids and the world around me.
											And, needless to say, thank God I wasn&#39;t using a thesaurus back then.
											I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world
											that perceived someone like me
											to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,
											when in fact, today I&#39;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures
											my life has procured.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,
											expecting to find a revision worth noting.
											Here&#39;s the updated version of this entry.
											Unfortunately, it&#39;s not much better.
											I find the last two words under &quot;Near Antonyms,&quot; particularly unsettling:
											&quot;whole&quot; and &quot;wholesome.&quot;
									</p>

									<p>
											So, it&#39;s not just about the words.
											It&#39;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words.
											It&#39;s about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.
											Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world
											and how we view other people.
											In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,
											believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,
											because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.
											So, what reality do we want to call into existence:
											a person who is limited, or a person who&#39;s empowered?
											By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,
											we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.
											Wouldn&#39;t we want to open doors for them instead?

											One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor
											at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.
											His name was Dr. Pizzutillo,

											The human ability to adapt, it&#39;s an interesting thing,
											because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,
											and I&#39;m going to make an admission:
											This phrase never sat right with me,
											and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people&#39;s questions about it,
											and I think I&#39;m starting to figure out why.
											Implicit in this phrase of &quot;overcoming adversity&quot;
											is the idea that success, or happiness,
											is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience
											unscathed or unmarked by the experience,
											as if my successes in life have come about from an ability
											to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,
											or what other people perceive as my disability.
											But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,
											whether physically, emotionally or both.
											And I&#39;m going to suggest that this is a good thing.
											Adversity isn&#39;t an obstacle that we need to get around
											in order to resume living our life.
											It&#39;s part of our life.
											And I tend to think of it like my shadow.
											Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there&#39;s very little,
											but it&#39;s always with me.
											And, certainly, I&#39;m not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person&#39;s struggle.

											There is adversity and challenge in life,
											and it&#39;s all very real and relative to every single person,
											but the question isn&#39;t whether or not you&#39;re going to meet adversity,
											but how you&#39;re going to meet it.
											So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,
											but preparing them to meet it well.
											And we do a disservice to our kids
											when we make them feel that they&#39;re not equipped to adapt.
											There&#39;s an important difference and distinction
											between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee
											and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I&#39;m disabled.
											And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I&#39;ve had to confront
											is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.

											In our desire to protect those we care about
											by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,
											or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,
											we have to make sure that we don&#39;t put the first brick in a wall
											that will actually disable someone.
											Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you
											and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual
											than the pathology itself.

											By not treating the wholeness of a person,
											by not acknowledging their potency,
											we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.
											We are effectively grading someone&#39;s worth to our community.
											So we need to see through the pathology
											and into the range of human capability.
											And, most importantly, there&#39;s a partnership
											between those perceived deficiencies
											and our greatest creative ability.
											So it&#39;s not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times
											as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,
											but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.
											So maybe the idea I want to put out there is
											not so much overcoming adversity
											as it is opening ourselves up to it,
											embracing it,
											grappling with it,
											to use a wrestling term,
											maybe even dancing with it.
											And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,
											we&#39;re less burdened by the presence of it.

											This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,
											and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,
											that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.
											To paraphrase: It&#39;s not the strongest of the species that survives,
											nor is it the most intelligent that survives;
											it is the one that is most adaptable to change.
											Conflict is the genesis of creation.
											From Darwin&#39;s work, amongst others, we can recognize that
											the human ability to survive and flourish
											is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict
											into transformation.
											So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.
											And, perhaps, until we&#39;re tested, we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re made of.
											Maybe that&#39;s what adversity gives us:
											a sense of self, a sense of our own power.
											So, we can give ourselves a gift.
											We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.
											Maybe we can see it as change.
											Adversity is just change that we haven&#39;t adapted ourselves to yet.

											and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,

											And he called this part of the course the X Factor,
											the potential of the human will.
											No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be
											as a determinant in the quality of someone&#39;s life.
											And Dr. Kean went on to tell me,

											I wouldn&#39;t have hesitated for a second.
											I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.
											But if you ask me today, I&#39;m not so sure.
											And it&#39;s because of the experiences I&#39;ve had with them,
											not in spite of the experiences I&#39;ve had with them.

											There was a case study done in 1960s Britain,
											when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.
											It&#39;s called the streaming trials. We call it &quot;tracking&quot; here in the States.
											It&#39;s separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.
											And the &quot;A students&quot; get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.
											Well, they took, over a three-month period,
											D-level students, gave them A&#39;s,
											told them they were &quot;A&#39;s,&quot; told them they were bright,

											Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.

											The teachers didn&#39;t know a switch had been made.
											They were simply told, &quot;These are the &#39;A-students,&#39; these are the &#39;D-students.&#39;&quot;
