											One thing the world needs,
											one thing this country desperately needs
											is a better way
											of conducting our political debates.
											We need to rediscover
											the lost art of democratic argument.
											(Applause)
											If you think about the arguments we have,
											most of the time it&#39;s shouting matches
											on cable television,
											ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.
											I have a suggestion.
											Look at all the arguments we have these days
											over health care,
											over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,
											over the gap between rich and poor,
											over affirmative action and same-sex marriage.
											Lying just beneath the surface
											of those arguments,
											with passions raging on all sides,
											are big questions
											of moral philosophy,
											big questions of justice.
											But we too rarely
											articulate and defend
											and argue about
											those big moral questions in our politics.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what I would like to do today
											is have something of a discussion.
											First, let me take
											a famous philosopher
											who wrote about those questions
											of justice and morality,
											give you a very short lecture
											on Aristotle of ancient Athens,
											Aristotle&#39;s theory of justice,
											and then have a discussion here
											to see whether Aristotle&#39;s ideas
											actually inform
											the way we think and argue
											about questions today.
											So, are you ready for the lecture?
											According to Aristotle,
											justice means giving people what they deserve.
											That&#39;s it; that&#39;s the lecture.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, you may say, well, that&#39;s obvious enough.
											The real questions begin
											when it comes to arguing about
											who deserves what and why.
											Take the example of flutes.
											Suppose we&#39;re distributing flutes.
											Who should get the best ones?
											Let&#39;s see what people —
											What would you say?
											Who should get the best flute?
											You can just call it out.

											But Peter,
											Aristotle doesn&#39;t agree with you that that&#39;s the reason.
											That&#39;s all right.
											Aristotle had a different reason
											for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
											He said,
											that&#39;s what flutes are for —
											to be played well.
											He says that to reason about
											just distribution of a thing,
											we have to reason about,
											and sometimes argue about,
											the purpose of the thing,
											or the social activity —
											in this case, musical performance.
											And the point, the essential nature,
											of musical performance
											is to produce excellent music.
											It&#39;ll be a happy byproduct
											that we&#39;ll all benefit.
											But when we think about justice,
											Aristotle says,
											what we really need to think about
											is the essential nature of the activity in question
											and the qualities that are worth
											honoring and admiring and recognizing.
											One of the reasons
											that the best flute players should get the best flutes
											is that musical performance
											is not only to make the rest of us happy,
											but to honor
											and recognize
											the excellence
											of the best musicians.

											He was a very good golfer,

											He had a bad leg, a circulatory problem,
											that made it very painful
											for him to walk the course.
											In fact, it carried risk of injury.
											He asked the PGA,
											the Professional Golfers&#39; Association,
											for permission to use a golf cart
											in the PGA tournaments.
											They said, &quot;No.
											Now that would give you an unfair advantage.&quot;
											He sued,
											and his case went all the way
											to the Supreme Court, believe it or not,
											the case over the golf cart,
											because the law says
											that the disabled
											must be accommodated,
											provided the accommodation does not
											change the essential nature
											of the activity.
											He says, &quot;I&#39;m a great golfer.

											What was interesting about their ruling
											and about the discussion we&#39;ve just had

											the right, the justice, of the matter
											depended on
											figuring out what is
											the essential nature of golf.
											And the Supreme Court justices
											wrestled with that question.
											And Justice Stevens, writing for the majority,
											said he had read all about the history of golf,
											and the essential point of the game
											is to get very small ball from one place
											into a hole
											in as few strokes as possible,
											and that walking was not essential, but incidental.

											Now, there were two dissenters,

											He wouldn&#39;t have granted the cart,
											and he had a very interesting dissent.
											It&#39;s interesting because
											he rejected the Aristotelian premise
											underlying the majority&#39;s opinion.
											He said it&#39;s not possible
											to determine the essential nature
											of a game like golf.
											Here&#39;s how he put it.
											&quot;To say that something is essential
											is ordinarily to say that it is necessary
											to the achievement of a certain object.
											But since it is the very nature of a game
											to have no object except amusement,
											(Laughter)
											that is, what distinguishes games
											from productive activity,
											(Laughter)
											it is quite impossible to say
											that any of a game&#39;s arbitrary rules
											is essential.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So there you have Justice Scalia
											taking on the Aristotelian premise
											of the majority&#39;s opinion.
											Justice Scalia&#39;s opinion
											is questionable
											for two reasons.
											First, no real sports fan would talk that way.
											(Laughter)
											If we had thought that the rules
											of the sports we care about
											are merely arbitrary,
											rather than designed to call forth
											the virtues and the excellences
											that we think are worthy of admiring,
											we wouldn&#39;t care about the outcome of the game.
											It&#39;s also objectionable
											on a second ground.
											On the face of it,
											it seemed to be — this debate about the golf cart —
											an argument about fairness,
											what&#39;s an unfair advantage.
											But if fairness were the only thing at stake,
											there would have been an easy and obvious solution.
											What would it be? (Audience: Let everyone use the cart.)
											Let everyone ride in a golf cart
											if they want to.
											Then the fairness objection goes away.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But letting everyone ride in a cart
											would have been, I suspect,
											more anathema
											to the golfing greats
											and to the PGA,
											even than making an exception for Casey Martin.
											Why?
											Because what was at stake
											in the dispute over the golf cart
											was not only the essential nature of golf,
											but, relatedly, the question:
											What abilities
											are worthy
											of honor and recognition
											as athletic talents?
											Let me put the point
											as delicately as possible:
											Golfers are a little sensitive
											about the athletic status of their game.
											(Laughter)
											After all, there&#39;s no running or jumping,
											and the ball stands still.
											(Laughter)
											So if golfing is the kind of game
											that can be played while riding around in a golf cart,
											it would be hard to confer
											on the golfing greats
											the status that we confer,
											the honor and recognition
											that goes to truly great athletes.
											That illustrates
											that with golf,
											as with flutes,
											it&#39;s hard to decide the question
											of what justice requires,
											without grappling with the question,
											&quot;What is the essential nature
											of the activity in question,
											and what qualities,
											what excellences
											connected with that activity,
											are worthy of honor and recognition?&quot;

									<p>
											Let&#39;s take a final example
											that&#39;s prominent in contemporary political debate:
											same-sex marriage.
											There are those who favor state recognition
											only of traditional marriage
											between one man and one woman,
											and there are those who favor state recognition
											of same-sex marriage.
											How many here
											favor the first policy:
											the state should recognize traditional marriage only?
											And how many favor the second, same-sex marriage?
											Now, put it this way:
											What ways of thinking
											about justice and morality
											underlie the arguments we have
											over marriage?
											The opponents of same-sex marriage say
											that the purpose of marriage,
											fundamentally, is procreation,
											and that&#39;s what&#39;s worthy of honoring
											and recognizing and encouraging.
											And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no,
											procreation is not the only purpose of marriage;
											what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?
											That&#39;s really what marriage is about.
											So with flutes, with golf carts,
											and even with a fiercely contested question
											like same-sex marriage,
											Aristotle has a point.
											Very hard to argue about justice
											without first arguing
											about the purpose of social institutions
											and about what qualities are worthy
											of honor and recognition.

											So let&#39;s step back from these cases
											and see how they shed light
											on the way we might improve, elevate,
											the terms of political discourse
											in the United States,
											and for that matter, around the world.
											There is a tendency to think
											that if we engage too directly
											with moral questions in politics,
											that&#39;s a recipe for disagreement,
											and for that matter, a recipe for
											intolerance and coercion.
											So better to shy away from,
											to ignore,
											the moral and the religious convictions
											that people bring to civic life.
											It seems to me that our discussion
											reflects the opposite,
											that a better way
											to mutual respect
											is to engage directly
											with the moral convictions
											citizens bring to public life,
											rather than to require
											that people leave their deepest moral convictions
											outside politics
											before they enter.
											That, it seems to me, is a way
											to begin to restore
											the art of democratic argument.

											Chris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses
											to same-sex marriage —
											that was a genius link.
											Now look, you&#39;re a pioneer of open education.
											Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big.
											What&#39;s your vision for the next phase of this?

											MS: Well, I think that it is possible.
											In the classroom, we have arguments
											on some of the most fiercely held
											moral convictions that students have
											about big public questions.
											And I think we can do that in public life more generally.
											And so my real dream would be
											to take the public television series
											that we&#39;ve created of the course —
											it&#39;s available now, online,
											free for everyone anywhere in the world —
											and to see whether we can partner with institutions,
											at universities in China, in India,
											in Africa, around the world,
											to try to promote
											civic education
											and also a richer kind
											of democratic debate.

											MS: Right. We did a little bit of it here
											with 1,500 people in Long Beach,
											and we do it in a classroom at Harvard
											with about 1,000 students.
											Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting
											to take this way
											of thinking and arguing,
											engaging seriously with big moral questions,
											exploring cultural differences
											and connect through a live video hookup,
											students in Beijing and Mumbai
											and in Cambridge, Massachusetts
											and create a global classroom.
											That&#39;s what I would love to do.

The <em>London Observer </em>calls him &quot;one of the most popular teachers in the world&quot; and indeed his lectures at Harvard draw thousands of students eager to discuss big questions of modern political life: bioethics, torture, rights versus responsibilities, the value we put on things. Sandel&#39;s class is a primer on thinking through the hard choices we face as citizens. The course has been turned into a public TV series with companion website and book:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/justicewhatsright\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Justice: What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do?</em></a>&nbsp;In his newest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/whatmoneycantbuy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>What Money Can&#39;t Buy</em></a><em>, </em>he challenges the idea that markets are morally neutral.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;To understand the importance of his purpose,&quot; a <em>Guardian</em> reviewer wrote of the book, &quot;you first have to grasp the full extent of the triumph achieved by market thinking in economics, and the extent to which that thinking has spread to other domains. This school sees economics as a discipline that has nothing to do with morality, and is instead the study of incentives, considered in an ethical vacuum. Sandel&#39;s book is, in its calm way, an all-out assault on that idea, and on the influential doctrine that the economic approach to &quot;utility maximisation&quot; explains all human behaviour.&quot;</p><p>Read more about his thinking on markets and morality: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/bd509112-9c55-11e2-9a4b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2PhLrm500\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Lunch with Michael Sandel&quot; on FT.com &gt;&gt;</a> &nbsp; </p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_sandel_the_lost_art_of_democratic_debate","viewed_count":1222029,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"Democracy thrives on civil debate, Michael Sandel  says -- but we're shamefully out of practice.

The <em>London Observer </em>calls him &quot;one of the most popular teachers in the world&quot; and indeed his lectures at Harvard draw thousands of students eager to discuss big questions of modern political life: bioethics, torture, rights versus responsibilities, the value we put on things. Sandel&#39;s class is a primer on thinking through the hard choices we face as citizens. The course has been turned into a public TV series with companion website and book:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/justicewhatsright\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Justice: What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do?</em></a>&nbsp;In his newest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/whatmoneycantbuy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>What Money Can&#39;t Buy</em></a><em>, </em>he challenges the idea that markets are morally neutral.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;To understand the importance of his purpose,&quot; a <em>Guardian</em> reviewer wrote of the book, &quot;you first have to grasp the full extent of the triumph achieved by market thinking in economics, and the extent to which that thinking has spread to other domains. This school sees economics as a discipline that has nothing to do with morality, and is instead the study of incentives, considered in an ethical vacuum. Sandel&#39;s book is, in its calm way, an all-out assault on that idea, and on the influential doctrine that the economic approach to &quot;utility maximisation&quot; explains all human behaviour.&quot;</p><p>Read more about his thinking on markets and morality: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/bd509112-9c55-11e2-9a4b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2PhLrm500\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Lunch with Michael Sandel&quot; on FT.com &gt;&gt;</a> &nbsp; </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Michael Sandel","tags":["democracy","government","law","philosophy","politics","sports"],"title":"The lost art of democratic debate","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1222029}]}
