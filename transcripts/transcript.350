											Video:
											On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold
											for 105,000 pounds — nine times the previous world record.
											The buyer
											was Kip Forbes,
											son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.
											The original owner of the bottle turned out to be
											one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.
											Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,
											the prince of any wine cellar.

											Benjamin Wallace: Now, that&#39;s about all the videotape that remains of an event
											that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.
											And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.
											In 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine world
											that he had made this incredible discovery.
											Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,
											and happened upon this hidden cache of wines —
											apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.
											He wouldn&#39;t reveal the exact number of bottles,
											he would not reveal
exactly where the building was
											and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.
											The mystery persisted for about 20 years.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.

											Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,
											and he became suspicious.
											And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI
											and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.
											There&#39;s now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,
											and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes.

									<p>
											But for those 20 years,
											an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures
											in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.
											I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine
											in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,
											must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.
											I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of
											you know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,
											not only on wine but on lots of things,
											and are they living a better life than me?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, I decided to embark on a quest. 


											With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,
											I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item
											in about a dozen categories,
											which was a very grueling quest, 
as you can imagine.

											This was the first one.
											A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.
											It may come from Wagyu cattle,
											but it&#39;s not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.
											There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,
											and one of them is Wolfgang Puck&#39;s restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.

											It was like, 160 dollars for this?
											And then I took a bite,
											and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.
											It&#39;s like foie gras — it&#39;s not even like steak.
											I almost couldn&#39;t finish it.

											White truffles. 

											One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.
											To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant
											in Manhattan — Del Posto.
											The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob
											and his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,
											&quot;Would Signore like the truffles?&quot;
											And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.
											It&#39;s not in their taste, really. It&#39;s not in their texture.
											It&#39;s in the smell.
											These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,
											this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.
											10 seconds passed and it was gone.
											And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,
											you know, their purpose had been served,
											and so I&#39;m afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.
											There were several — several of these items were disappointments.

											Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil
											from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.
											And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.
											He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,
											he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.
											And he actually — once he releases a batch of it,
											he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,
											so you can go online and look at your batch number
											and see how the phenolics are developing,

											and, you know, gauge its freshness.
											I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.
											It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.
											It was very green, it was very peppery.
											But in the blind taste test, it came in last.
											The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of

											There was one object that I could not get my hands on,

											The &#39;47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.
											And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux
											in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.
											And 1947 was a legendary vintage,
											especially in the right bank of Bordeaux.
											And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura
											that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.
											But it&#39;s 60 years old.
											There&#39;s not much of it left.
											What there is of it left you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s real —

											And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.

											It was three days, four meals. 

											And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the &#39;47.
											And you know, it had this fragrant softness,
											and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.
											And then I tasted it, and it,
											you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,
											which is characteristic of that wine —
											that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.
											There were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.
											There were some people who were a little less impressed.
											And I wasn&#39;t that impressed.
											And I don&#39;t — call my palate a philistine palate —
											so it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean something that I wasn&#39;t impressed,
											but I was not the only one there who had that reaction.
											And it wasn&#39;t just to that wine.
											Any one of the wines served at this tasting,
											if I&#39;d been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,
											the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.
											But drinking 60 great wines over three days,

											And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study
											which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.
											And they gave subjects the same wine,
											labeled with different price tags.
											A lot of people, you know,
											said that they liked the more expensive wine more —
											it was the same wine, but they thought it was a different one
											that was more expensive.
											But what was unexpected was that these researchers did
											MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,
											and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more —
											their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure
											from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag.

He's been a contributor to <i>GQ</i>, <i>Details</i>, <i>Salon</i> and <i>The Washington Post</i>.","whylisten":"<p>A Washington D.C. native and a current Brooklynite, Benjamin Wallace is fast establishing himself a master of <strong>the brainy nonfiction thriller</strong>, rooting up feuds and controversies in pop and less-than-pop culture while buddying up with their embattled and larger-than-life personalities (whom he sometimes meets on their way down). He profiled conserative mouthpiece Glenn Beck for <em>GQ</em> in 2007 shortly after the pundit landed a controversial slot on CNN, and in 2002 looked at chef Georges Perrier of Philidelphia&#39;s then-five-star restaurant, Le Bec-Fin. </p><p>Wallace&#39;s orderly, deadpan writing style hints at one of his secrets: his love (and talent) for <strong>playing the straight man to the once-mighty in downfall</strong>, right as they go aflame in tragicomic hubris. (<a href=\"http://geni.us/billionairevinegar\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Billionaire&#39;s Vinegar</em></a>&nbsp;is simply a pleasure, not least to schadenfreude junkies.) It&#39;s easy to imagine him, the bespectacled wallflower, watching as brouhaha over a wine bottle once valued at $165,000 -- the highest price fetched for a bottle, ever -- culimates in a court trial that reveals at least two of its main characters, a wine collector and a wine expert, to be frauds.
