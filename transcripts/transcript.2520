											Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here&#39;s the story.
											All my life I wanted to be an actress.
											From the time I was very small,
I could feel the magic of storytelling
											and I wanted to be a part of it.
											So, at the ripe age of 21,
											I graduated from the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts
											in New York City,
											bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
and ready to take my rightful place
											as the next Meryl Streep.
											That&#39;s my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, it&#39;s important for this story
that you understand
											that I was raised by a raging feminist.
											I mean, just to give you some idea:
											when I was five or six years old
and obsessed with &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot;
											and running around, singing,
&quot;I am 16 going on 17,&quot;
											all day every day,
											my mother sat me down
for a very serious conversation
											and she said, &quot;OK, look.
											I&#39;m not going to say
that you can&#39;t sing that song,
											but if you are going to sing that song,
I do need you to understand
											the extremely problematic
gender construct that it reinforces.&quot;

											OK. So I graduate.
											And I start auditioning
and I get work, slowly.
											But I just start noticing
that the parts available for women
											are terrible.
											But, remember — I came here
											to play smart, willful,
complicated, interesting
											complex, confident
female characters, right?
											Like Meryl.
											And all of the sudden,
											I am wrestling with 300 other
gorgeous, talented women
											to play ...
											&quot;[Female] No dialogue.
											The character only needs
to stand on a balcony,
											look forlorn, and walk back
inside the house.

											So, maybe a year or so after this,
											I&#39;m having lunch
with an actress friend of mine,
											and we&#39;re talking about
how insane this is.
											And we decide, you know what? No problem.
											We&#39;ll just make our own movie.
											And I&#39;ll write and then I&#39;ll write it
about two complex female characters.
											So we do.
											We set out to make this movie,
											and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring
an all-female production team:
											the writer, directors, producers,
											and it&#39;s a film about two women.
											And so pretty soon,
we&#39;re sitting in the office
											of a successful male producer,
											and he goes, &quot;OK, girls.
											So, you do understand that at some point
you are going to have to hire
											a male producer onboard, right?
											Just so that people
will trust you with their money.&quot;
											Over and over again, people tell us,
											&quot;Yeah, but people don&#39;t really
want to see films about women,
											so maybe you should think about
making something else.
											It&#39;s just the way it is.&quot;
											So we make the movie, anyway.
											We scrape together 80,000 dollars,
											and we make it, and it does so well.
											It gets into tons of festivals
and we win a lot of awards
											and it&#39;s big and exciting.

											But these experiences I&#39;ve had
just keep rubbing at me.
											And so, I just start talking about them,
											first, at Q and A&#39;s after
screenings of the film,
											and then I get invited to be on panels
and talk at conferences.
											And the really amazing thing
is that, to begin with,
											when I&#39;m just talking to audiences
											and other people, you know,
coming up in the film industry,
											the universal reaction is,
											&quot;Oh my god! This is terrible.
What do we do about this?&quot;
											But the bigger panels I get on,
											suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me,
											&quot;Look, I totally agree
with everything you&#39;re saying.
											You just need to be really careful
about where you say it.&quot;
											An Oscar-winning producer tells me

											Well, let me put it to you this way:
											the year &quot;Jaws&quot; came out,

											In 1995, BMW paid the James Bond franchise
three million dollars

from driving an Aston Martin

											That one move caused so many people
to go out and buy that car,
											that BMW made 240 million dollars

											female participation in archery
went up 105 percent.

											So now, consider this:
											if you have watched
mostly American movies in your lifetime,
											95 percent of all the films
you have ever seen
											were directed by men.
											Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent
of all of the leading characters
											that you have ever seen
											were men.
											And even if we just talk about
the last five years,
											55 percent of the time
that you have seen a woman in a movie,
											she was naked or scantily clad.
											That affects you.
											That affects all of us.
											We actually can&#39;t even imagine
how much it affects us,
											because this is all we&#39;ve ever had.
											Stories — and movies
are just modern stories —
											are not frivolous.
											They&#39;re actually the mechanism

											So what do we do about this?
											This may be the first time
a lot of you are hearing about this,

have spent years —
											a lot of people,
a lot longer than I have —
											giving speeches and doing panels
and writing articles
											and doing studies,
											and really just yelling at Hollywood
to do a better job about this.
											I mean, we have really yelled at them.
											And yet, Paramount and Fox
recently released their slates,
											and of the 47 films that they will release
between now and 2018,
											not a single one
will be directed by a woman.
											So it is beginning to occur to me
											that waiting for Hollywood
to grow a conscience
											may not actually be a winning strategy.
											In fact, it seems to me
											that whenever there is a small,
ruling class of people
											who have all of the money
and power and resources,
											they&#39;re not actually that excited
about giving it up.
											And so you don&#39;t get change by asking them
											or even yelling at them.
											You have to make that change happen
											through a revolution.
											Now, please don&#39;t worry —
I promise you, here, now, today,
											our body count will be very low.

returns on investment —

											Three: invest in each other.
											Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like
we need to stop wasting so much energy

											We need to find our audience
and invest in cultivating them.
											If we can figure out
how to make our movies
											and deliver them
to the audiences that want them,
											that&#39;s it.
											That&#39;s the whole game.
											And whatever they&#39;re doing in the middle
											is going to cease to be
quite so important.
											Audiences, invest in us.
											Help us make the movies
that you want to see.
											If you can give a female filmmaker
25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign,
											great, do that.
											If you can invest more seriously
											and help us over that critical
million-dollar hurdle,
											do that.
											But invest in seeing
the other half of the story.

to all of the businesspeople
											and entrepreneurs.
											This does not happen
very often in the world,
											but right here we have a golden situation
											in which you can enact
significant social change
											while also making money.
											Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption.
											The old models of financing
and distribution are crumbling —
											please come in and disrupt it.
											I&#39;ll give you an example.
											Right now, with some incredible women,
											I am launching the &quot;The 51 Fund.&quot;
											It&#39;s a venture capital fund
											that will finance films written, directed
and produced by women
											in that critical $1-5 million range.
											We will give a significant number
of female filmmakers
											the chance to make their movies
											and we will deliver them
to the audiences who want them.
											Good for equality, good for business.
											But that&#39;s only one example, we need more.
											There is room for so many more.
											So I say to you:
											Hollywood is leaving money on the table.
											Come pick it up.

											Now, all of this may seem like a lot,
but it is actually so doable.
											Entrenched systems don&#39;t change
because you ask the people in charge,
											they change because all of the people
who don&#39;t have what they want
											rise up and make that change happen.
											And don&#39;t you want to?
											I want to see what the other
51 percent of the population has to say.
											I want to watch movies
that teach me about people
											who are different than I am.
											I want to see women&#39;s bodies on film
that aren&#39;t perfect.
											I want to give our little boys the chance
											to empathize with female characters
											so that they can become more whole men.
											And I definitely want
to give a little girl
											who may not have a real-life role model
											the chance to watch movies
											and see women doing everything
she dreams of achieving.
