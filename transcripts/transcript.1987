<title>David Rothkopf: How fear drives American politics | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Does it seem like Washington has no new ideas? Instead of looking to build the future, it sometimes feels like the US political establishment happily retreats into fear and willful ignorance. Journalist David Rothkopf lays out a few of the major issues that US leadership is failing to address -- from cybercrime to world-shaking new tech to the reality of modern total war -- and calls for a new vision that sets fear aside." />

<meta content='Does it seem like Washington has no new ideas? Instead of looking to build the future, it sometimes feels like the US political establishment happily retreats into fear and willful ignorance. Journalist David Rothkopf lays out a few of the major issues that US leadership is failing to address — from cybercrime to world-shaking new tech to the reality of modern total war — and calls for a new vision that sets fear aside.' itemprop='description'>

											But I also grew up in a time
where there was something to fear.
											We were brought out in the hall
when I was a little kid
											and taught how to put
our coats over our heads
											to protect us from global
thermonuclear war.
											Now even my seven-year-old brain
knew that wasn&#39;t going to work.

											And yet, despite the fact
that we lived for 50 years
											with the threat of such a war,
											the response of our government
and of our society
											was to do wonderful things.
											We created the space program
in response to that.
											We built our highway system
in response to that.
											We created the Internet
in response to that.
											So sometimes fear can produce
a constructive response.
											But sometimes it can produce
an un-constructive response.

											On September 11, 2001,
											19 guys took over four airplanes
											and flew them into a couple of buildings.
											They exacted a horrible toll.
											It is not for us to minimize
what that toll was.
											But the response that we had
was clearly disproportionate —
											disproportionate to the point
of verging on the unhinged.
											We rearranged the national security
apparatus of the United States
											and of many governments
											to address a threat that,
at the time that those attacks took place,
											was quite limited.
											In fact, according to our
intelligence services,
											on September 11, 2001,
											there were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda.
											There were just a few thousand terrorists.
											They posed an existential threat

											But we rearranged our entire
national security apparatus
											in the most sweeping way
since the end of the Second World War.
											We launched two wars.
											We spent trillions of dollars.
											We suspended our values.
											We violated international law.
											We embraced torture.
											We embraced the idea
											that if these 19 guys could do this,
anybody could do it.
											And therefore,
for the first time in history,
											we were seeing everybody as a threat.
											And what was the result of that?
											Surveillance programs that listened in
on the emails and phone calls
											of entire countries —
											hundreds of millions of people —
											setting aside whether
those countries were our allies,
											setting aside what our interests were.
											I would argue that 15 years later,
											since today there are more terrorists,
											more terrorist attacks,
more terrorist casualties —
											this by the count
of the U.S. State Department —
											since today the region
from which those attacks emanate
											is more unstable
than at any time in its history,
											since the Flood, perhaps,
											we have not succeeded in our response.

											Now you have to ask,
where did we go wrong?
											What did we do?
What was the mistake that was made?
											And you might say, well look,
Washington is a dysfunctional place.
											There are political food fights.
											We&#39;ve turned our discourse
into a cage match.
											And that&#39;s true.
											But there are bigger problems,
believe it or not, than that dysfunction,
											even though I would argue
											that dysfunction that makes it impossible
to get anything done
											in the richest and most powerful
country in the world
											is far more dangerous than anything
that a group like ISIS could do,
											because it stops us in our tracks
and it keeps us from progress.

											But there are other problems.
											And the other problems
											came from the fact that in Washington
and in many capitals right now,
											we&#39;re in a creativity crisis.
											In Washington, in think tanks,
											where people are supposed to be
thinking of new ideas,
											you don&#39;t get bold new ideas,
											because if you offer up a bold new idea,
											not only are you attacked on Twitter,
											but you will not get confirmed
in a government job.
											Because we are reactive to the heightened
venom of the political debate,
											you get governments that have
an us-versus-them mentality,
											tiny groups of people making decisions.
											When you sit in a room with a small group
of people making decisions,
											what do you get?
											You get groupthink.
											Everybody has the same worldview,
											and any view from outside of the group
is seen as a threat.
											That&#39;s a danger.
											You also have processes
that become reactive to news cycles.
											And so the parts of the U.S. government
that do foresight, that look forward,
											that do strategy —
											the parts in other governments
that do this — can&#39;t do it,
											because they&#39;re reacting
to the news cycle.
											And so we&#39;re not looking ahead.

											On 9/11, we had a crisis
because we were looking the wrong way.
											Today we have a crisis because,
because of 9/11,
											we are still looking

											and we know because we see
transformational trends on the horizon

											In fact, the things that we are seeing

											And so what are those trends?
											Well, to a group like you,
											the trends are apparent.
											We are living at a moment
in which the very fabric of human society
											is being rewoven.
											If you saw the cover of The Economist
a couple of days ago —
											it said that 80 percent
of the people on the planet,
											by the year 2020, would have a smartphone.
											They would have a small computer
connected to the Internet in their pocket.
											In most of Africa, the cell phone
penetration rate is 80 percent.
											We passed the point last October
											when there were more
mobile cellular devices, SIM cards,
											out in the world than there were people.
											We are within years
of a profound moment in our history,
											when effectively every single
human being on the planet
											is going to be part of a man-made
system for the first time,
											able to touch anyone else —
											touch them for good, touch them for ill.
											And the changes associated with that
are changing the very nature
											of every aspect of governance
and life on the planet
											in ways that our leaders
ought to be thinking about,
											when they&#39;re thinking about
these immediate threats.

											On the security side,
											we&#39;ve come out of a Cold War in which
it was too costly to fight a nuclear war,
											and so we didn&#39;t,
											to a period that I call
Cool War, cyber war,
											where the costs of conflict are actually
so low, that we may never stop.
											We may enter a period of constant warfare,
											and we know this because
we&#39;ve been in it for several years.
											And yet, we don&#39;t have the basic doctrines
to guide us in this regard.
											We don&#39;t have the basic ideas formulated.
											If someone attacks us with a cyber attack,
											do have the ability to respond
with a kinetic attack?
											We don&#39;t know.
											If somebody launches a cyber attack,
how do we deter them?
											When China launched
a series of cyber attacks,
											what did the U.S. government do?
											It said, we&#39;re going to indict
a few of these Chinese guys,
											who are never coming to America.
											They&#39;re never going to be anywhere near
a law enforcement officer
											who&#39;s going to take them into custody.

											Special forces operators
out there in the field today
											discover that small groups
of insurgents with cell phones
											have access to satellite imagery
that once only superpowers had.
											In fact, if you&#39;ve got a cell phone,
											you&#39;ve got access to power
that a superpower didn&#39;t have,
											and would have highly
classified 10 years ago.
											In my cell phone,
I have an app that tells me
											where every plane in the world is,
and its altitude, and its speed,
											and what kind of aircraft it is,
											and where it&#39;s going
and where it&#39;s landing.
											They have apps that allow them to know
											what their adversary is about to do.
											They&#39;re using these tools in new ways.
											When a cafe in Sydney
was taken over by a terrorist,
											he went in with a rifle...
											and an iPad.
											And the weapon was the iPad.
											Because he captured people,
he terrorized them,
											he pointed the iPad at them,

and he put it on the Internet,
											and he took over the world&#39;s media.

											But it doesn&#39;t just affect
the security side.
											The relations between great powers —
											we thought we were past the bipolar era.
											We thought we were in a unipolar world,
											where all the big issues were resolved.
											Remember? It was the end of history.
											But we&#39;re not.
											We&#39;re now seeing that our
basic assumptions about the Internet —
											that it was going to connect us,
weave society together —
											are not necessarily true.
											In countries like China,
you have the Great Firewall of China.
											You&#39;ve got countries saying no,
if the Internet happens within our borders
											we control it within our borders.
											We control the content.
We are going to control our security.
											We are going to manage that Internet.
											We are going to say what can be on it.
											We&#39;re going to set

well, that&#39;s just China.

											It&#39;s China, India, Russia.
											It&#39;s Saudi Arabia,
it&#39;s Singapore, it&#39;s Brazil.

the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,

											And that gets us to another breakdown
											that&#39;s crucial,
											and another breakdown that couldn&#39;t be
more important to a group like this,
											because the growth of America
and real American national security
											and all of the things that drove progress
even during the Cold War,
											was a public-private partnership
between science, technology and government
											that began when Thomas Jefferson
sat alone in his laboratory
											inventing new things.
											But it was the canals
and railroads and telegraph;
											it was radar and the Internet.
											It was Tang, the breakfast drink —
											probably not the most important
of those developments.
											But what you had was
a partnership and a dialogue,
											and the dialogue has broken down.
											It&#39;s broken down because in Washington,
											less government is considered more.
											It&#39;s broken down because there is,
believe it or not,
											in Washington, a war on science —
											despite the fact that
in all of human history,
											every time anyone has waged
a war on science,
											science has won.

in senior national security jobs,
