<meta content='Before he fought in the galactic battles of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was a United States Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company. He tells the story of how and why he became a Marine, the complex transition from soldier to civilian — and Arts in the Armed Forces, his nonprofit that brings theater to the military. Because, as he says: "Self-expression is just as valuable a tool as a rifle on your shoulder." Followed by a spirited performance of Marco Ramirez&#x0027;s "I am not Batman" by Jesse J. Perez and Matt Johnson. (Adult language)' itemprop='description'>

in the country did at the time,

of patriotism and retribution

that I wasn&#39;t doing anything.

from high school that past summer,

of my parents&#39; house paying rent,

in Northern Indiana,

											So after the 11th,
											and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,
											and just being pissed off
in general — at myself,
											my parents, the government;
											not having confidence,
not having a respectable job,
											my shitty mini-fridge that I just
drove to California and back —
											I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.
I loved being a Marine.
											It&#39;s one of the things I&#39;m most proud
of having done in my life.
											Firing weapons was cool,
											driving and detonating
expensive things was great.
											But I found I loved
the Marine Corps the most
											for the thing I was looking
for the least when I joined,
											which was the people:
											these weird dudes —
a motley crew of characters
											from a cross section
of the United States —
											that on the surface I had
nothing in common with.
											And over time,
											all the political and personal bravado
											that led me to the military dissolved,
											and for me, the Marine Corps
became synonymous with my friends.

											And then, a few years into my service
											and months away from deploying to Iraq,
											I dislocated my sternum
in a mountain-biking accident,
											and had to be medically separated.
											Those never in the military
may find this hard to understand,
											but being told I wasn&#39;t getting deployed
to Iraq or Afghanistan
											was very devastating for me.
											I have a very clear image of leaving
the base hospital on a stretcher

											Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.

											Everything you do
is either steeped in tradition

											You can&#39;t smoke in the field

to give away your position.

you have to maintain

											Walk this way, talk this way
