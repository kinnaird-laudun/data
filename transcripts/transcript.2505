<title>Christiane Amanpour: How to seek truth in the era of fake news | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Known worldwide for her courage and clarity, Christiane Amanpour has spent the past three decades interviewing business, cultural and political leaders who have shaped history. In conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Amanpour discusses fake news, objectivity in journalism, the leadership vacuum in global politics and more, sharing her wisdom along the way. &quot;Be careful where you get information from,&quot; she says. &quot;Unless we are all engaged as global citizens who appreciate the truth, who understand science, empirical evidence and facts, then we are going to be wandering around -- to a potential catastrophe.&quot;" />

<meta content='How to seek truth in the era of fake news' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Known worldwide for her courage and clarity, Christiane Amanpour has spent the past three decades interviewing business, cultural and political leaders who have shaped history. In conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Amanpour discusses fake news, objectivity in journalism, the leadership vacuum in global politics and more, sharing her wisdom along the way. "Be careful where you get information from," she says. "Unless we are all engaged as global citizens who appreciate the truth, who understand science, empirical evidence and facts, then we are going to be wandering around — to a potential catastrophe."' itemprop='description'>

											Chris Anderson: Christiane,
great to have you here.
											So you&#39;ve had this amazing viewpoint,
											and perhaps it&#39;s fair to say
that in the last few years,
											there have been some alarming
developments that you&#39;re seeing.
											What&#39;s alarmed you most?
									</p>

											Christiane Amanpour: Well, just listening
to the earlier speakers,
											I can frame it
in what they&#39;ve been saying:
											climate change, for instance —
cities, the threat to our environment
											and our lives.
											It basically also boils down to
understanding the truth
											and to be able to get to the truth
of what we&#39;re talking about
											in order to really be able to solve it.
											So if 99.9 percent
of the science on climate
											is empirical, scientific evidence,
											but it&#39;s competing almost equally
with a handful of deniers,
											that is not the truth;
											that is the epitome of fake news.
											And so for me, the last few years —
certainly this last year —
											has crystallized the notion of fake news
in a way that&#39;s truly alarming
											and not just some slogan
to be thrown around.
											Because when you can&#39;t distinguish
between the truth and fake news,
											you have a very much more
difficult time trying to solve
											some of the great issues that we face.

											CA: Well, you&#39;ve been involved
in this question of,
											what is balance, what is truth,
what is impartiality,
											for a long time.
											You were on the front lines
reporting the Balkan Wars 25 years ago.
											And back then, you famously said,
											by calling out human right abuses,
											you said, &quot;Look, there are some situations
one simply cannot be neutral about,
											because when you&#39;re neutral,
											you are an accomplice.&quot;
											So, do you feel that today&#39;s journalists
aren&#39;t heeding that advice
											about balance?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											CA: Well, look, I think for journalists,
objectivity is the golden rule.
											But I think sometimes we don&#39;t understand
what objectivity means.
											And I actually learned this very,
very young in my career,
											which was during the Balkan Wars.
											I was young then.
											It was about 25 years ago.
											And what we faced was the wholesale
violation, not just of human rights,
											but all the way to ethnic
cleansing and genocide,
											and that has been adjudicated
in the highest war crimes court
											in the world.
											So, we know what we were seeing.
											Trying to tell the world
what we were seeing
											brought us accusations of bias,
											of siding with one side,
											of not seeing the whole side,
											and just, you know,
trying to tell one story.
											I particularly and personally
was accused of siding with,
											for instance, the citizens of Sarajevo —
											&quot;siding with the Muslims,&quot;
											because they were the minority
who were being attacked
											by Christians on the Serb side
											in this area.
											And it worried me.
											It worried me that I was being
accused of this.
											I thought maybe I was wrong,
											maybe I&#39;d forgotten what objectivity was.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

									<p>
											But then I started to understand
that what people wanted
											was actually not to do anything —
											not to step in,
											not to change the situation,
											not to find a solution.
											And so, their fake news at that time,
											their lie at that time —
											including our government&#39;s,
our democratically elected government&#39;s,
											with values and principles
of human rights —
											their lie was to say
that all sides are equally guilty,
											that this has been centuries
of ethnic hatred,
											whereas we knew that wasn&#39;t true,
											that one side had decided to kill,
slaughter and ethnically cleanse
											another side.
											So that is where, for me,
											I understood that objectivity means
giving all sides an equal hearing
											and talking to all sides,
											but not treating all sides equally,
											not creating a forced moral equivalence
or a factual equivalence.
											And when you come up against
that crisis point
											in situations of grave violations
of international and humanitarian law,
											if you don&#39;t understand
what you&#39;re seeing,
											if you don&#39;t understand the truth
											and if you get trapped
in the fake news paradigm,
											then you are an accomplice.
											And I refuse to be
an accomplice to genocide.

											CA: Well, look — I am really alarmed.
											And everywhere I look,
											you know, we&#39;re buffeted by it.
											Obviously, when the leader
of the free world,
											when the most powerful person
in the entire world,
											which is the president
of the United States —
											this is the most important, most powerful
country in the whole world,
											economically, militarily, politically
in every which way —
											and it seeks to, obviously, promote
its values and power around the world.
											So we journalists,
who only seek the truth —
											I mean, that is our mission —
											we go around the world
looking for the truth
											in order to be everybody&#39;s eyes and ears,
											people who can&#39;t go out
in various parts of the world
											to figure out what&#39;s going on
about things that are vitally important
											to everybody&#39;s health and security.
											So when you have a major world leader
accusing you of fake news,
											it has an exponential ripple effect.
											And what it does is,
it starts to chip away
											at not just our credibility,
											but at people&#39;s minds —
											people who look at us,
and maybe they&#39;re thinking,
											&quot;Well, if the president
of the United States says that,

											meant that there was a proliferation
of truth and transparency
											and depth and accuracy.
											But I think the opposite has happened.
											You know, I&#39;m a little bit of a Luddite,

											Even when we started to talk about
the information superhighway,
											which was a long time ago,
											before social media, Twitter
and all the rest of it,
											I was actually really afraid
											that that would put people
into certain lanes and tunnels
											and have them just focusing
on areas of their own interest
											instead of seeing the broad picture.
											And I&#39;m afraid to say
that with algorithms, with logarithms,
											with whatever the &quot;-ithms&quot; are
											that direct us into all these particular
channels of information,
											that seems to be happening right now.
											I mean, people have written
about this phenomenon.
											People have said that yes,
the internet came,
											its promise was to exponentially explode
our access to more democracy,
											more information,
											less bias,
											more varied information.
											And, in fact, the opposite has happened.
											And so that, for me,
is incredibly dangerous.
											And again, when you are the president
of this country and you say things,
											it also gives leaders in other
undemocratic countries the cover
											to affront us even worse,
											and to really whack us —
and their own journalists —
											with this bludgeon of fake news.

											&quot;For me, nationalism means war.
											We have seen it before,
											we have lived through it before
on my continent,
											and I am very clear about that.&quot;
											So he was not going to,
just for political expediency,
											embrace the, kind of, lowest
common denominator
											that had been embraced
in other political elections.
											And he stood against Marine Le Pen,
who is a very dangerous woman.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/christiane_amanpour_how_to_seek_truth_in_the_era_of_fake_news","viewed_count":1426552,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"Christiane Amanpour recommends","blurb":"Check out these resources, curated by Christiane Amanpour","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":"","type":"recommendation","rec_lists":[{"title":"My 10 favorite books","description":"","rec_items":[{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Peter the Great: His Life and World*","blurb":"I try to read as much history as possible, and around Russia’s invasion of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, I devoured this massive tome… and cheekily, I even sent the Russian language version to Vladimir Putin!

It was written in 1948, and I read it when I was at university in the early 1980s when South Africa was the big moral story of the time. I longed to be a foreign correspondent and get out there. I also read and wept through many performances of South African playwright Athol Fugard’s plays.

It’s not just one of the great works of English fiction, but many describe how it morphs its meaning to suit all seasons of the reader’s life. The story of the evolving emotions and thoughts of a young girl who reaches womanhood and falls in love with an older man evokes a great romantic love. But on the other hand, the story of his wife, hidden away — descending into madness — caused me frissons of deep fear at the mental illness which was very much the unspoken unknown then, and in my own childhood. At the end of the day, it’s an important work for all boys and girls to read, because of its highly developed, complicated and wonderful female heroine.","note":" Charlotte Brontë\r\nPenguin Classics, 2006","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Jane-Penguin-Classics-Charlotte-Brontë/dp/0141441143/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Black Beauty*","blurb":"This was the first real classic I remember reading.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Christiane Amanpour","tags":["algorithm","journalism","communication","government","democracy","global issues","leadership","politics","social media","war"],"title":"How to seek truth in the era of fake news","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1426552}]}
