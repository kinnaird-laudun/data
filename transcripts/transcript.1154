									<p>
											A few months ago
											the Nobel Prize in physics
											was awarded to two teams of astronomers
											for a discovery that has been hailed
											as one of the most important
											astronomical observations ever.
											And today, after briefly describing what they found,
											I&#39;m going to tell you about a highly controversial framework
											for explaining their discovery,
											namely the possibility
											that way beyond the Earth,
											the Milky Way and other distant galaxies,
											we may find that our universe
											is not the only universe,
											but is instead
											part of a vast complex of universes
											that we call the multiverse.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.
											I mean, most of us were raised to believe
											that the word &quot;universe&quot; means everything.
											And I say most of us with forethought,
											as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.
											And last year I was holding her
											and I said, &quot;Sophia,
											I love you more than anything in the universe.&quot;
											And she turned to me and said, &quot;Daddy,
											universe or multiverse?&quot;
											(Laughter)

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But barring such an anomalous upbringing,
											it is strange to imagine
											other realms separate from ours,
											most with fundamentally different features,
											that would rightly be called universes of their own.
											And yet,
											speculative though the idea surely is,
											I aim to convince you
											that there&#39;s reason for taking it seriously,
											as it just might be right.
											I&#39;m going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.
											In part one,
											I&#39;m going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results
											and to highlight a profound mystery
											which those results revealed.
											In part two,
											I&#39;ll offer a solution to that mystery.
											It&#39;s based on an approach called string theory,
											and that&#39;s where the idea of the multiverse
											will come into the story.
											Finally, in part three,
											I&#39;m going to describe a cosmological theory
											called inflation,
											which will pull all the pieces of the story together.

									<p>
											Okay, part one starts back in 1929
											when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble
											realized that the distant galaxies
											were all rushing away from us,
											establishing that space itself is stretching,
											it&#39;s expanding.
											Now this was revolutionary.
											The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales
											the universe was static.
											But even so,
											there was one thing that everyone was certain of:
											The expansion must be slowing down.
											That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth
											slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward,
											the gravitational pull
											of each galaxy on every other
											must be slowing
											the expansion of space.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now let&#39;s fast-forward to the 1990s
											when those two teams of astronomers
											I mentioned at the outset
											were inspired by this reasoning
											to measure the rate
											at which the expansion has been slowing.
											And they did this
											by painstaking observations
											of numerous distant galaxies,
											allowing them to chart
											how the expansion rate has changed over time.
											Here&#39;s the surprise:
											They found that the expansion is not slowing down.
											Instead they found that it&#39;s speeding up,
											going faster and faster.

											Similarly, the astronomers&#39; results
											are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize,
											but they raised an analogous question.
											What force is driving all galaxies
											to rush away from every other
											at an ever-quickening speed?
											Well the most promising answer
											comes from an old idea of Einstein&#39;s.
											You see, we are all used to gravity
											being a force that does one thing,
											pulls objects together.
											But in Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity,
											his general theory of relativity,
											gravity can also push things apart.

											How? Well according to Einstein&#39;s math,
											if space is uniformly filled
											with an invisible energy,
											sort of like a uniform, invisible mist,
											then the gravity generated by that mist
											would be repulsive,
											repulsive gravity,
											which is just what we need to explain the observations.
											Because the repulsive gravity
											of an invisible energy in space —
											we now call it dark energy,
											but I&#39;ve made it smokey white here so you can see it —
											its repulsive gravity
											would cause each galaxy to push against every other,
											driving expansion to speed up,
											not slow down.
											And this explanation
											represents great progress.

											But I promised you a mystery
											here in part one.
											Here it is.
											When the astronomers worked out
											how much of this dark energy
											must be infusing space
											to account for the cosmic speed up,
											look at what they found.
											This number is small.
											Expressed in the relevant unit,
											it is spectacularly small.
											And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.
											We want this number
											to emerge from the laws of physics,
											but so far no one has found a way to do that.

											Now you might wonder,

											Some details provide
											windows into uncharted realms of reality,
											and this peculiar number may be doing just that,
											as the only approach that&#39;s so far made headway to explain it
											invokes the possibility of other universes —

									<p>
											So hold the mystery of the dark energy
											in the back of your mind
											as I now go on to tell you
											three key things about string theory.
											First off, what is it?
											Well it&#39;s an approach to realize Einstein&#39;s dream
											of a unified theory of physics,
											a single overarching framework
											that would be able to describe
											all the forces at work in the universe.
											And the central idea of string theory
											is quite straightforward.
											It says that if you examine
											any piece of matter ever more finely,
											at first you&#39;ll find molecules
											and then you&#39;ll find atoms and subatomic particles.
											But the theory says that if you could probe smaller,
											much smaller than we can with existing technology,
											you&#39;d find something else inside these particles —
											a little tiny vibrating filament of energy,
											a little tiny vibrating string.
											And just like the strings on a violin,
											they can vibrate in different patterns
											producing different musical notes.
											These little fundamental strings,
											when they vibrate in different patterns,
											they produce different kinds of particles —
											so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons,
											all other particles
											would be united into a single framework,
											as they would all arise from vibrating strings.
											It&#39;s a compelling picture,
											a kind of cosmic symphony,
											where all the richness
											that we see in the world around us
											emerges from the music
											that these little, tiny strings can play.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But there&#39;s a cost
											to this elegant unification,
											because years of research
											have shown that the math of string theory doesn&#39;t quite work.
											It has internal inconsistencies,
											unless we allow
											for something wholly unfamiliar —
											extra dimensions of space.
											That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.
											And you can think about those
											as height, width and depth.
											But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales,
											there are additional dimensions
											crumpled to a tiny size so small
											that we have not detected them.
											But even though the dimensions are hidden,
											they would have an impact on things that we can observe
											because the shape of the extra dimensions
											constrains how the strings can vibrate.
											And in string theory,
											vibration determines everything.
											So particle masses, the strengths of forces,
											and most importantly, the amount of dark energy
											would be determined
											by the shape of the extra dimensions.
											So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions,
											we should be able to calculate these features,
											calculate the amount of dark energy.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The challenge
											is we don&#39;t know
											the shape of the extra dimensions.
											All we have
											is a list of candidate shapes
											allowed by the math.
											Now when these ideas were first developed,
											there were only about five different candidate shapes,
											so you can imagine
											analyzing them one-by-one
											to determine if any yield
											the physical features we observe.
											But over time the list grew
											as researchers found other candidate shapes.
											From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands —
											A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze,
											since after all,
											graduate students need something to do.
											But then the list continued to grow
											into the millions and the billions, until today.
											The list of candidate shapes
											has soared to about 10 to the 500.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, what to do?
											Well some researchers lost heart,
											concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions,
											each giving rise to different physical features,
											string theory would never make
											definitive, testable predictions.
											But others turned this issue on its head,
											taking us to the possibility of a multiverse.
											Here&#39;s the idea.
											Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.
											Each is as real as every other,
											in the sense
											that there are many universes,
											each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.
											And this radical proposal
											has a profound impact on this mystery:
											the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Because you see,
											if there are other universes,
											and if those universes
											each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions,
											then the physical features of each universe will be different,
											and in particular,
											the amount of dark energy in each universe
											will be different.
											Which means that the mystery
											of explaining the amount of dark energy we&#39;ve now measured
											would take on a wholly different character.
											In this context,
											the laws of physics can&#39;t explain one number for the dark energy
											because there isn&#39;t just one number,
											there are many numbers.
											Which means
											we have been asking the wrong question.
											It&#39;s that the right question to ask is,
											why do we humans find ourselves in a universe
											with a particular amount of dark energy we&#39;ve measured
											instead of any of the other possibilities
											that are out there?

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And that&#39;s a question on which we can make headway.
											Because those universes
											that have much more dark energy than ours,
											whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies,
											the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong
											that it blows the clump apart
											and galaxies don&#39;t form.
											And in those universes that have much less dark energy,
											well they collapse back on themselves so quickly
											that, again, galaxies don&#39;t form.
											And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets
											and no chance
											for our form of life
											to exist in those other universes.

									<p>
											So we find ourselves in a universe
											with the particular amount of dark energy we&#39;ve measured
											simply because our universe has conditions
											hospitable to our form of life.
											And that would be that.
											Mystery solved,
											multiverse found.
											Now some find this explanation unsatisfying.
											We&#39;re used to physics
											giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.
											But the point is,
											if the feature you&#39;re observing
											can and does take on
											a wide variety of different values
											across the wider landscape of reality,
											then thinking one explanation
											for a particular value
											is simply misguided.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											An early example
											comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler
											who was obsessed with understanding
											a different number —
											why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.
											And he worked for decades trying to explain this number,
											but he never succeeded, and we know why.
											Kepler was asking
											the wrong question.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We now know that there are many planets
											at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.
											So hoping that the laws of physics
											will explain one particular number, 93 million miles,
											well that is simply wrongheaded.
											Instead the right question to ask is,
											why do we humans find ourselves on a planet
											at this particular distance,
											instead of any of the other possibilities?
											And again, that&#39;s a question we can answer.
											Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun
											would be so hot
											that our form of life wouldn&#39;t exist.
											And those planets that are much farther away from the star,
											well they&#39;re so cold
											that, again, our form of life would not take hold.
											So we find ourselves
											on a planet at this particular distance
											simply because it yields conditions
											vital to our form of life.
											And when it comes to planets and their distances,
											this clearly is the right kind of reasoning.
											The point is,
											when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain,
											it may also be the right kind of reasoning.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											One key difference, of course,
											is we know that there are other planets out there,
											but so far I&#39;ve only speculated on the possibility
											that there might be other universes.
											So to pull it all together,
											we need a mechanism
											that can actually generate other universes.
											And that takes me to my final part, part three.
											Because such a mechanism has been found
											by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.
											You see, when we speak of the Big Bang,
											we often have an image
											of a kind of cosmic explosion
											that created our universe
											and set space rushing outward.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But there&#39;s a little secret.
											The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important,
											the Bang.
											It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang,
											but gives us no insight
											into what would have powered the Bang itself.
											And this gap was finally filled
											by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.
											It&#39;s called inflationary cosmology,
											which identified a particular kind of fuel
											that would naturally generate
											an outward rush of space.
											The fuel is based on something called a quantum field,
											but the only detail that matters for us
											is that this fuel proves to be so efficient
											that it&#39;s virtually impossible
											to use it all up,
											which means in the inflationary theory,
											the Big Bang giving rise to our universe
											is likely not a one-time event.
											Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang,
											but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs,
											each giving rise to its own separate universe
											with our universe becoming but one bubble
											in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And now, when we meld this with string theory,
											here&#39;s the picture we&#39;re led to.
											Each of these universes has extra dimensions.
											The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.
											The different shapes yield different physical features.
											And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another
											simply because it&#39;s only in our universe
											that the physical features, like the amount of dark energy,
											are right for our form of life to take hold.
											And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture
											of the wider cosmos
											that cutting-edge observation and theory
											have now led us to seriously consider.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											One big remaining question, of course, is,
											could we ever confirm
											the existence of other universes?
											Well let me describe
											one way that might one day happen.
											The inflationary theory
											already has strong observational support.
											Because the theory predicts
											that the Big Bang would have been so intense
											that as space rapidly expanded,
											tiny quantum jitters from the micro world
											would have been stretched out to the macro world,
											yielding a distinctive fingerprint,
											a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots,
											across space,
											which powerful telescopes have now observed.
											Going further, if there are other universes,
											the theory predicts that every so often
											those universes can collide.
											And if our universe got hit by another,
											that collision
											would generate an additional subtle pattern
											of temperature variations across space
											that we might one day
											be able to detect.
											And so exotic as this picture is,
											it may one day be grounded
											in observations,
											establishing the existence of other universes.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I&#39;ll conclude
											with a striking implication
											of all these ideas
											for the very far future.
											You see, we learned
											that our universe is not static,
											that space is expanding,
											that that expansion is speeding up
											and that there might be other universes
											all by carefully examining
											faint pinpoints of starlight
											coming to us from distant galaxies.
											But because the expansion is speeding up,
											in the very far future,
											those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast
											that we won&#39;t be able to see them —
											not because of technological limitations,
											but because of the laws of physics.
											The light those galaxies emit,
											even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light,
											will not be able to overcome
											the ever-widening gulf between us.
											So astronomers in the far future
											looking out into deep space
											will see nothing but an endless stretch
											of static, inky, black stillness.
											And they will conclude
											that the universe is static and unchanging
											and populated by a single central oasis of matter
											that they inhabit —
											a picture of the cosmos
											that we definitively know to be wrong.

									<p>
											Now maybe those future astronomers will have records
											handed down from an earlier era,
											like ours,
											attesting to an expanding cosmos
											teeming with galaxies.
											But would those future astronomers
											believe such ancient knowledge?
											Or would they believe
											in the black, static empty universe
											that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?
											I suspect the latter.
											Which means that we are living
											through a remarkably privileged era
											when certain deep truths about the cosmos
											are still within reach
											of the human spirit of exploration.
											It appears that it may not always be that way.
											Because today&#39;s astronomers,
											by turning powerful telescopes to the sky,
											have captured a handful of starkly informative photons —
											a kind of cosmic telegram
											billions of years in transit.
											and the message echoing across the ages is clear.
											Sometimes nature guards her secrets
											with the unbreakable grip
											of physical law.
											Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons
											from just beyond the horizon.
