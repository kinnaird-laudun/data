<title>Eric Dishman: Take health care off the mainframe | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At TEDMED, Eric Dishman makes a bold argument: The US health care system is like computing circa 1959, tethered to big, unwieldy central systems: hospitals, doctors, nursing homes. As our aging population booms, it&#39;s imperative, he says, to create personal, networked, home-based health care for all." />

											If you think about the phone —
											and Intel has tested
											a lot of the things I&#39;m going to show you,
											over the last 10 years,
											in about 600 elderly households —
											300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland —
											trying to understand: How do we measure
											and monitor behavior
											in a medically meaningful way?
									</p>
								</div>

									<p>
											And if you think about the phone, right,
											it&#39;s something that we can use for some incredible ways
											to help people actually take the right medication at the right time.
											We&#39;re testing these kinds of simple
											sensor-network technologies in the home
											so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with
											can help them deal with their medications.
											And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone,
											and it&#39;s our system whispering to them which pill they need to take,
											and they fake like they&#39;re having a conversation with a friend.
											And they&#39;re not embarrassed by a meds caddy that&#39;s ugly,
											that sits on their kitchen table and says,
											&quot;I&#39;m old. I&#39;m frail.&quot;
											It&#39;s surreptitious technology
											that&#39;s helping them do a simple task
											of taking the right pill at the right time.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.
											Because that moment when you answer the phone
											is a cognitive test every time that you do it.
											Think about it, all right? I&#39;m going to answer the phone three different times.
											&quot;Hello? Hey.&quot;
											All right? That&#39;s the first time.
											&quot;Hello? Uh, hey.&quot;
											&quot;Hello? Uh, who?
											Oh, hey.&quot;
											All right? Very big differences
											between the way I answered the phone the three times.
											And as we monitor phone usage
											by seniors over a long period of time,
											down to the tenths of a microsecond,
											that recognition moment
											of whether they can figure out that person on the other end
											is a friend and we start talking to them immediately,
											or they do a lot of what&#39;s called trouble talk,
											where they&#39;re like, &quot;Wait, who is this? Oh.&quot; Right?
											Waiting for that recognition moment
											may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia
											than anything that shows up clinically today.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We call these behavioral markers.
											There&#39;s lots of others. Is the person going to the phone
											as quickly, when it rings, as they used to?
											Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?
											Has their voice gotten more quiet? We&#39;re doing a lot of work with people
											with Alzheimer&#39;s and particularly with Parkinson&#39;s,
											where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson&#39;s patients
											may be the best early indicator
											of Parkinson&#39;s five to 10 years before it shows up clinically.
											But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time
											are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme
											and your voice has become so quiet.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.
											When you pick up the phone,
											how much tremor are you having,
											and what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time?
											Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to?
											Is it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis?
											Are you using the phone? Are you socializing less than you used to?
											And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health
											mean, as a kind of a vital sign of the future?
											And then wow, what a radical idea,
											we — except in the United States —
											might be able to use this newfangled technology
											to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line.
											Wow, what a great day that will be
											once we&#39;re allowed to actually do those kinds of things.

											So, these are what I would call behavioral markers.
											And it&#39;s the whole field that we&#39;ve been trying to work on
											for the last 10 years at Intel.
											How do you put simple disruptive technologies,
											and the first of five phrases that I&#39;m going to talk about in this talk?
											Behavioral markers matter.
											How do we change behavior?
											How do we measure changes in behavior
											in a meaningful way that&#39;s going to help us with
											prevention of disease, early onset of disease,
											and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time?

									<p>
											Now, why would Intel let me
											spend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years,
											trying to understand the needs of seniors
											and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers?
											This is some of the field work that we&#39;ve done.
											We have now lived with 1,000 elderly households
											in 20 countries over the last 10 years.
											We study people in Rochester, New York.
											We go live with them in the winter
											because what they do in the winter,
											and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize,
											is very different than in the summer.
											If they have a hip fracture we go with them
											and we study their entire discharge experience.
											If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network,
											we fly and study them as well.

											of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years
											in 20 different countries.
											Why is Intel willing to fund that?
											It&#39;s because of the second slogan that I want to talk about.
											Ten years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel
											to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies
											that could help with independent living,
											this is what I called it: &quot;Y2K + 10.&quot;

											But with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet,
											embedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systems
											that we borrowed from sports medicine,
											we&#39;re starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households

											And most often we can do two interventions,

											My fifth and final phrase:
											I have tried for two years,

											from something and to something,
											from a mainframe model
											to a personal health model,
											or to mean something more than just a debate

											It doesn&#39;t matter how we finance healthcare.
											We&#39;re going to figure something out
											for the next 10 years, and try it.
											No matter who pays for it,
											we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way
											and treating the home and the patient
											and the family member and the caregivers
											as part of these coordinated care teams
											and using disruptive technologies that are already here
											to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.

											The president needs to stand up and say,
											at the end of a healthcare reform debate,
											&quot;Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care
											out of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,
											to the home, in 10 years.&quot;
											It&#39;s achievable. We should do it economically,

											So, you know, that&#39;s my last message to you.
											How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal
											of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that&#39;s coming?
											It&#39;s not that innovation and technology is going to be the
											magic pill that cures all, but it&#39;s going to be part of the solution.
											And if we don&#39;t create a personal health movement,
											something that we&#39;re all aiming towards in reform,
											then we&#39;re going to move nowhere.
											So, I hope you&#39;ll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.
