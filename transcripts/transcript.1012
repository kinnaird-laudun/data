											So historically there has
											been a huge divide between what people
											consider to be non-living systems on one
											side, and living systems on the other side.
											So we go from, say, this beautiful and
											complex crystal as non-life, and this rather
											beautiful and complex cat on the other side.
											Over the last hundred and fifty years or so,
											science has kind of blurred this distinction
											between non-living and living systems, and
											now we consider that there may be a kind
											of continuum that exists between the two.
											We&#39;ll just take one example here:
											a virus is a natural system, right?
											But it&#39;s very simple. It&#39;s very simplistic.
											It doesn&#39;t really satisfy all the requirements,
											it doesn&#39;t have all the characteristics
											of living systems and is in fact a parasite
											on other living systems in order to, say,
											reproduce and evolve.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But what we&#39;re going to be talking about here
											tonight are experiments done on this sort of
											non-living end of this spectrum — so actually
											doing chemical experiments in the laboratory,
											mixing together nonliving ingredients
											to make new structures, and that these
											new structures might have some of the
											characteristics of living systems.
											Really what I&#39;m talking about here is
											trying to create a kind of artificial life.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what are these characteristics that I&#39;m
											talking about? These are them.
											We consider first that life has a body.
											Now this is necessary to distinguish the self
											from the environment.
											Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a
											process by which life can convert resources
											from the environment into building blocks
											so it can maintain and build itself.
											Life also has a kind of inheritable information.
											Now we, as humans, we store our information
											as DNA in our genomes and we pass this
											information on to our offspring.
											If we couple the first two — the body and the metabolism —
											we can come up with a system that could
											perhaps move and replicate, and if we
											coupled these now to inheritable information,
											we can come up with a system that would be
											more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.
											And so these are the things we will try to do
											in the lab, make some experiments that have
											one or more of these characteristics of life.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So how do we do this? Well, we use
											a model system that we term a protocell.
											You might think of this as kind of like a
											primitive cell. It is a simple chemical
											model of a living cell, and if you consider
											for example a cell in your body may have
											on the order of millions of different types
											of molecules that need to come together,
											play together in a complex network
											to produce something that we call alive.
											In the laboratory what we want to do
											is much the same, but with on the order of
											tens of different types of molecules —
											so a drastic reduction in complexity, but still
											trying to produce something that looks lifelike.
											And so what we do is, we start simple
											and we work our way up to living systems.
											Consider for a moment this quote by
											Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a
											kind of synthetic biology:
											&quot;The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,
											will not be the sensational discovery which we
											usually associate with the idea.&quot;
											That&#39;s his first statement. So if we actually
											create life in the laboratories, it&#39;s
											probably not going to impact our lives at all.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											&quot;If we accept the theory of evolution, then
											the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist
											in the production of forms intermediate
											between the inorganic and the organic
											world, or between the non-living
											and living world, forms which possess
											only some of the rudimentary attributes of life&quot;
											— so, the ones I just discussed —
											&quot;to which other attributes will be slowly added
											in the course of development by the
											evolutionary actions of the environment.&quot;
											So we start simple, we make some structures
											that may have some of these characteristics
											of life, and then we try to develop that
											to become more lifelike.
											This is how we can start to make a protocell.
											We use this idea called self-assembly.
											What that means is, I can mix some
											chemicals together in a test tube in my lab,
											and these chemicals will start to self-associate
											to form larger and larger structures.
											So say on the order of tens of thousands,
											hundreds of thousands of molecules will
											come together to form a large structure
											that didn&#39;t exist before.
											And in this particular example,
											what I took is some membrane molecules,
											mixed those together in the right environment,
											and within seconds it forms these rather
											complex and beautiful structures here.
											These membranes are also quite similar,
											morphologically and functionally,
											to the membranes in your body,
											and we can use these, as they say,
											to form the body of our protocell.

									<p>
											Likewise,
											we can work with oil and water systems.
											As you know, when you put oil and water together,
											they don&#39;t mix, but through self-assembly
											we can get a nice oil droplet to form,
											and we can actually use this as a body for
											our artificial organism or for our protocell,
											as you will see later.
											So that&#39;s just forming some body stuff, right?
											Some architectures.
											What about the other aspects of living systems?
											So we came up with this protocell model here
											that I&#39;m showing.
											We started with a natural occurring clay
											called montmorillonite.
											This is natural from the environment, this clay.
											It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.
											It could run a metabolism on it.
											Certain kind of molecules like to associate
											with the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red
											— this is a relative of DNA,
											it&#39;s an informational molecule —
											it can come along and it starts to associate
											with the surface of this clay.
											This structure, then, can organize the
											formation of a membrane boundary around
											itself, so it can make a body of
											liquid molecules around itself, and that&#39;s
											shown in green here on this micrograph.
											So just through self-assembly, mixing things
											together in the lab, we can come up with, say,
											a metabolic surface with some
											informational molecules attached
											inside of this membrane body, right?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we&#39;re on a road towards living systems.
											But if you saw this protocell, you would not
											confuse this with something that was actually alive.
											It&#39;s actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,
											it doesn&#39;t really do anything.
											So, something is missing.
											Some things are missing.
											So some things that are missing is,
											for example, if you had a flow of energy
											through a system, what we&#39;d want
											is a protocell that can harvest
											some of that energy in order to maintain itself,
											much like living systems do.
											So we came up with a different protocell
											model, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.
											In this protocell model, it&#39;s just an oil droplet,
											but a chemical metabolism inside
											that allows this protocell to use energy
											to do something, to actually become dynamic,
											as we&#39;ll see here.
											You add the droplet to the system.
											It&#39;s a pool of water, and the protocell
											starts moving itself around in the system.
											Okay? Oil droplet forms
											through self-assembly, has a chemical
											metabolism inside so it can use energy,
											and it uses that energy to move itself
											around in its environment.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											As we heard earlier, movement is very
											important in these kinds of living systems.
											It is moving around, exploring its environment,
											and remodeling its environment, as you see,
											by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.
											So it&#39;s acting, in a sense, like a living system
											trying to preserve itself.
											We take this same moving protocell here,
											and we put it in another experiment,
											get it moving. Then I&#39;m going
											to add some food to the system,
											and you&#39;ll see that in blue here, right?
											So I add some food source to the system.
											The protocell moves. It encounters the food.
											It reconfigures itself and actually then
											is able to climb to the highest concentration
											of food in that system and stop there.
											Alright? So not only do we have this system
											that has a body, it has a metabolism,
											it can use energy, it moves around.
											It can sense its local environment
											and actually find resources
											in the environment to sustain itself.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, this doesn&#39;t have a brain, it doesn&#39;t have
											a neural system. This is just a sack of
											chemicals that is able to have this interesting
											and complex lifelike behavior.
											If we count the number of chemicals
											in that system, actually, including the water
											that&#39;s in the dish, we have five chemicals
											that can do this.
											So then we put these protocells together in a
											single experiment to see what they would do,
											and depending on the conditions, we have
											some protocells on the left that are
											moving around and it likes to touch the other
											structures in its environment.
											On the other hand we have two moving
											protocells that like to circle each other,
											and they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.
											Right? So not only do individual protocells
											have behavior, what we&#39;ve interpreted as
											behavior in this system, but we also have
											basically population-level behavior
											similar to what organisms have.
											So now that you&#39;re all experts on protocells,
											we&#39;re going to play a game with these protocells.
											We&#39;re going to make two different kinds.
											Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry
											inside that, when activated, the protocell
											starts to vibrate around, just dancing.
											So remember, these are primitive things,
											so dancing protocells, that&#39;s very
											interesting to us. (Laughter)
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The second protocell has a different
											chemistry inside, and when activated,
											the protocells all come together and they fuse
											into one big one. Right?
											And we just put these two together
											in the same system.
											So there&#39;s population A,
											there&#39;s population B, and then
											we activate the system,
											and protocell Bs, they&#39;re the blue ones,
											they all come together. They fuse together
											to form one big blob, and the other protocell
											just dances around. And this just happens
											until all of the energy in the system is
											basically used up, and then, game over.
											So then I repeated this experiment
											a bunch of times, and one time
											something very interesting happened.
											So, I added these protocells together
											to the system, and protocell A and protocell B
											fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.
											That didn&#39;t happen before. There it goes.
											There&#39;s a protocell AB now in this system.
											Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,
											while protocell B does the fusing, okay?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But then something even more interesting happens.
											Watch when these two large protocells,
											the hybrid ones, fuse together.
											Now we have a dancing protocell
											and a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter)
											Just with blobs of chemicals, again.
											So the way this works is, you have
											a simple system of five chemicals here,
											a simple system here. When they hybridize,
											you then form something that&#39;s different than
											before, it&#39;s more complex than before,
											and you get the emergence of another kind of
											lifelike behavior which
											in this case is replication.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So since we can make some interesting
											protocells that we like, interesting colors and
											interesting behaviors, and they&#39;re very easy
											to make, and they have interesting lifelike
											properties, perhaps these protocells have
											something to tell us about the origin of life
											on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an
											easily accessible step, one of the first steps
											by which life got started on the early Earth.
											Certainly, there were molecules present on
											the early Earth, but they wouldn&#39;t have been
											these pure compounds that we worked with
											in the lab and I showed in these experiments.
											Rather, they&#39;d be a real complex mixture of
											all kinds of stuff, because
											uncontrolled chemical reactions produce
											a diverse mixture of organic compounds.
											Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay?
											And it&#39;s a pool that&#39;s too difficult to fully
											characterize, even by modern methods, and
											the product looks brown, like this tar here
											on the left. A pure compound
											is shown on the right, for contrast.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So this is similar to what happens when you
											take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,
											you put them in a pan, and you apply energy.
											You turn up the heat, you start making
											or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,
											forming a brownish caramel, right?
											If you let that go unregulated, you&#39;ll
											continue to make and break chemical bonds,
											forming an even more diverse mixture of
											molecules that then forms this kind of black
											tarry stuff in your pan, right, that&#39;s
											difficult to wash out. So that&#39;s what
											the origin of life would have looked like.
											You needed to get life out of this junk that
											is present on the early Earth,
											four, 4.5 billion years ago.
											So the challenge then is,
											throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab,
											and try to make some protocells with lifelike
											properties from this kind of primordial ooze.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we&#39;re able to then see the self-assembly
											of these oil droplet bodies again
											that we&#39;ve seen previously,
											and the black spots inside of there
											represent this kind of black tar — this diverse,
											very complex, organic black tar.
											And we put them into one of these
											experiments, as you&#39;ve seen earlier, and then
											we watch lively movement that comes out.
											They look really good, very nice movement,
											and also they appear to have some kind of
											behavior where they kind of circle
											around each other and follow each other,
											similar to what we&#39;ve seen before — but again,
											working with just primordial conditions,
											no pure chemicals.
											These are also, these tar-fueled protocells,
											are also able to locate resources
											in their environment.
											I&#39;m going to add some resource from the left,
											here, that defuses into the system,
											and you can see, they really like that.
											They become very energetic, and able
											to find the resource in the environment,
											similar to what we saw before.
											But again, these are done in these primordial
											conditions, really messy conditions,
											not sort of sterile laboratory conditions.
											These are very dirty little protocells,
											as a matter of fact. (Laughter)
											But they have lifelike properties, is the point.

									<p>
											So, doing these artificial life experiments
											helps us define a potential path between
											non-living and living systems.
											And not only that, but it helps us
											broaden our view of what life is
											and what possible life there could be
											out there — life that could be very different
											from life that we find here on Earth.
											And that leads me to the next
											term, which is &quot;weird life.&quot;
											This is a term by Steve Benner.
											This is used in reference to a report
											in 2007 by the National Research Council
											in the United States, wherein
											they tried to understand how we can
											look for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,
											especially if that life is very different from life
											on Earth. If we went to another planet and
											we thought there might be life there,
											how could we even recognize it as life?

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, they came up with three very general
											criteria. First is — and they&#39;re listed here.
											The first is, the system has to be in
											non-equilibrium. That means the system
											cannot be dead, in a matter of fact.
											Basically what that means is, you have
											an input of energy into the system that life
											can use and exploit to maintain itself.
											This is similar to having the Sun shining
											on the Earth, driving photosynthesis,
											driving the ecosystem.
											Without the Sun, there&#39;s likely to be
											no life on this planet.
											Secondly, life needs to be in liquid form,
											so that means even if we had some
											interesting structures, interesting molecules
											together but they were frozen solid,
											then this is not a good place for life.
											And thirdly, we need to be able to make
											and break chemical bonds. And again
											this is important because life transforms
											resources from the environment into
											building blocks so it can maintain itself.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now today, I told you about very strange
											and weird protocells — some that contain clay,
											some that have primordial ooze in them,
											some that have basically oil
											instead of water inside of them.
											Most of these don&#39;t contain DNA,
											but yet they have lifelike properties.
											But these protocells satisfy
											these general requirements of living systems.
											So by making these chemical, artificial
											life experiments, we hope not only
											to understand something fundamental
											about the origin of life and the existence
											of life on this planet, but also
											what possible life there could be
											out there in the universe. Thank you.
