											As a cross-country skier
and member of the Australian ski team
											headed towards the Winter Olympics,
											I was on a training bike ride
with my fellow teammates.
											As we made our way up
towards the spectacular Blue Mountains
											west of Sydney,
											it was the perfect autumn day:
											sunshine, the smell
of eucalypt and a dream.
											Life was good.
											We&#39;d been on our bikes
for around five-and-a-half hours
											when we got to the part
of the ride that I loved,
											and that was the hills,
because I loved the hills.
											I got up off the seat of my bike
and I started pumping my legs,
											and as I sucked in the cold mountain air,
I could feel it burning my lungs,
											and I looked up to see
the sun shining in my face.

											And then everything went black.
											Where was I? What was happening?
											My body was consumed by pain.
											I&#39;d been hit by a speeding utility truck
											with only 10 minutes
to go on the bike ride.
											I was airlifted from the scene
of the accident by a rescue helicopter
											to a large spinal unit in Sydney.
											I had extensive
and life-threatening injuries.
											I&#39;d broken my neck
and my back in six places.
											I broke five ribs on my left side.
											I broke my right arm.
I broke my collarbone.
											I broke some bones in my feet.
											My whole right side was ripped open,
filled with gravel.
											My head was cut open
across the front, lifted back,
											exposing the skull underneath.
											I had head injures.
I had internal injuries.
											I had massive blood loss.
											In fact, I lost
about five liters of blood,
											which is all someone my size
would actually hold.
											By the time the helicopter arrived
at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney,
											my blood pressure was 40 over nothing.
											I was having a really bad day.

											The next concern
was whether I would walk again,

from the waist down.
											They said to my parents
that the neck break was a stable fracture,
											but the back was completely crushed:
											the vertebra at L1
was like you&#39;d dropped a peanut,
											stepped on it, smashed it
into thousands of pieces.
											They&#39;d have to operate.
											They went in. They put me on a beanbag.
											They cut me — literally cut me in half.
											I have a scar that wraps
around my entire body.
											They picked as much
broken bone as they could
											that had lodged in my spinal cord.
											They took out two of my broken ribs
and they rebuilt my back —
											L1, they rebuilt it,
they took out another broken rib,
											they fused T12, L1 and L2 together.
											Then they stitched me up;
they took an entire hour to stitch me up.
											I woke up in intensive care,
											and the doctors were really excited
that the operation had been a success,
											because at that stage,
I had a little bit of movement

											And little goals
kept me going along the way,
											and eventually I got
my private pilot&#39;s license.
											Then I learned to navigate,
and I flew my friends around Australia.
											And then I learned to fly
an airplane with two engines
											and I got my twin-engine rating.
											And then I learned to fly in bad weather
as well as fine weather,
											and got my instrument rating.
											And then I got
my commercial pilot&#39;s license.
											And then I got my instructor rating.
											And then I found myself
back at that same school
											where I&#39;d gone for that very first flight,
											teaching other people how to fly ...
											just under 18 months
after I&#39;d left the spinal ward.

											The philosopher Lao Tzu once said,

											I now know that it wasn&#39;t until I let go
of who I thought I was

a completely new life.
											It wasn&#39;t until I let go
of the life I thought I should have ...
											that I was able to embrace
the life that was waiting for me.
											I now know that my real strength
											never came from my body.
											And although my physical capabilities
have changed dramatically,
											who I am is unchanged.
											The pilot light inside of me
was still alight,
											just as it is in each and every one of us.

											I know that I&#39;m not my body.
											And I also know that you&#39;re not yours.
											And then it no longer matters
what you look like,

or what you do for a living.
											All that matters is that we continue
to fan the flame of humanity
											by living our lives
as the ultimate creative expression
											of who we really are,
											because we are all connected
											by millions and millions of straws.
											And it&#39;s time to join those up
											and to hang on.
											And if we are to move
towards our collective bliss ...
											it&#39;s time we shed our focus
on the physical
											and instead embrace
the virtues of the heart.

Paralysed and immobile for six months, she was given a grim picture for recovery. But not only did she teach herself to walk again— she learned to fly.","whylisten":"<p>Janine Shepherd is a &ldquo;walking paraplegic.&rdquo; Defying her disability, she has become a commercial pilot and aerobatics instructor, motivational speaker, best-selling author, and mother of three. A champion cross-country skier in training for the Calgary Olympics, Janine&rsquo;s life changed forever when she was hit by a truck during a bicycle ride in the Blue Mountains of Australia. Doctors did not expect her to survive.</p><p> After six months in hospital&mdash;nearly all of it on her back&mdash;Janine focused intently on healing both her broken body and crushed morale. A turning point in her recovery came when a small plane flying overhead gave her the most improbable idea.   &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she exclaimed from her wheelchair.  &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t walk, I&rsquo;ll fly.&rdquo; </p><p> Still encased in a full body cast, Janine had to be lifted into an aircraft for her introductory flight lesson. But within a year she had defied the odds and earned her private pilot&rsquo;s license. Her talent and skill as a pilot earned Janine a commercial pilot license and ultimately, her flying instructor&rsquo;s rating.  Then she decided to learn to fly upside down, and finally, to teach acrobatic flight to other pilots.</p><p> Janine is an ambassador for Spinal Cure Australia and Red Bull Wings For Life, and is committed to helping find a cure for spinal cord injury in the near future. She was awarded the Order of Australia, the nation&rsquo;s highest honor. She is a contributor to Deepak Chopra&rsquo;s workshops, and has been featured on <em>60 Minutes</em> and <em>This Is Your Life.</em> </p><p> In the meantime, she seeks to inspire those coping with physical disability and life challenges. Janine is the author of six books, including the newly released memoir <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1622037103/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1622037103&amp;linkId=cfe4651f72f79b4633d63c507d0fc52b\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Defiant: A Broken Body Is Not a Broken Person</em></a>.

tragedy brings the author face to face with death and the destruction of the only future she ever dreamed of. From there, we join her in a great adventure and an unforgettable spiritual ride that inspires and amazes.","whotheyare":"Aspiring Olympic skier Janine Shepherd was nearly killed when she was hit by a truck during a training bike ride. Paralysed and immobile for six months, she was given a grim picture for recovery. But not only did she teach herself to walk again— she learned to fly.","whylisten":"<p>Janine Shepherd is a &ldquo;walking paraplegic.&rdquo; Defying her disability, she has become a commercial pilot and aerobatics instructor, motivational speaker, best-selling author, and mother of three. A champion cross-country skier in training for the Calgary Olympics, Janine&rsquo;s life changed forever when she was hit by a truck during a bicycle ride in the Blue Mountains of Australia. Doctors did not expect her to survive.</p><p> After six months in hospital&mdash;nearly all of it on her back&mdash;Janine focused intently on healing both her broken body and crushed morale. A turning point in her recovery came when a small plane flying overhead gave her the most improbable idea.   &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she exclaimed from her wheelchair.  &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t walk, I&rsquo;ll fly.&rdquo; </p><p> Still encased in a full body cast, Janine had to be lifted into an aircraft for her introductory flight lesson. But within a year she had defied the odds and earned her private pilot&rsquo;s license. Her talent and skill as a pilot earned Janine a commercial pilot license and ultimately, her flying instructor&rsquo;s rating.  Then she decided to learn to fly upside down, and finally, to teach acrobatic flight to other pilots.</p><p> Janine is an ambassador for Spinal Cure Australia and Red Bull Wings For Life, and is committed to helping find a cure for spinal cord injury in the near future. She was awarded the Order of Australia, the nation&rsquo;s highest honor. She is a contributor to Deepak Chopra&rsquo;s workshops, and has been featured on <em>60 Minutes</em> and <em>This Is Your Life.</em> </p><p> In the meantime, she seeks to inspire those coping with physical disability and life challenges. Janine is the author of six books, including the newly released memoir <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1622037103/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1622037103&amp;linkId=cfe4651f72f79b4633d63c507d0fc52b\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Defiant: A Broken Body Is Not a Broken Person</em></a>.
