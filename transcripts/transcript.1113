											What do I know
											that would cause me,
											a reticent, Midwestern scientist,
											to get myself arrested
											in front of the White House protesting?
											And what would you do
											if you knew what I know?
											Let&#39;s start with how I got to this point.
											I was lucky to grow up
											at a time when it was not difficult
											for the child of a tenant farmer
											to make his way to the state university.

											And I was really lucky
											to go to the University of Iowa
											where I could study under Professor James Van Allen
											who built instruments
											for the first U.S. satellites.
											Professor Van Allen told me
											about observations of Venus,
											that there was intense microwave radiation.
											Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere?
											Or was Venus extremely hot?
											The right answer,
											confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft,
											was that Venus was very hot —
											900 degrees Fahrenheit.
											And it was kept hot
											by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.

											I was fortunate to join NASA
											and successfully propose
											an experiment to fly to Venus.
											Our instrument took this image
											of the veil of Venus,
											which turned out to be
											a smog of sulfuric acid.
											But while our instrument was being built,
											I became involved in calculations
											of the greenhouse effect
											here on Earth,
											because we realized
											that our atmospheric composition was changing.
											Eventually, I resigned
											as principal investigator
											on our Venus experiment
											because a planet changing before our eyes
											is more interesting and important.
											Its changes will affect all of humanity.

											The greenhouse effect had been well understood
											for more than a century.
											British physicist John Tyndall,
											in the 1850&#39;s,
											made laboratory measurements
											of the infrared radiation,
											which is heat.
											And he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat,
											thus acting like a blanket
											warming Earth&#39;s surface.

											I worked with other scientists
											to analyze Earth climate observations.
											In 1981,
											we published an article in Science magazine
											concluding that observed warming
											of 0.4 degrees Celsius
											in the prior century
											was consistent with the greenhouse effect
											of increasing CO2.
											That Earth would likely warm in the 1980&#39;s,
											and warming would exceed
											the noise level of random weather
											by the end of the century.
											We also said that the 21st century
											would see shifting climate zones,
											creation of drought-prone regions
											in North America and Asia,
											erosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels
											and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.
											All of these impacts
											have since either happened
											or are now well under way.

											That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times
											and led to me testifying to Congress
											in the 1980&#39;s,
											testimony in which I emphasized
											that global warming increases both extremes
											of the Earth&#39;s water cycle.
											Heatwaves and droughts on one hand,
											directly from the warming,
											but also, because a warmer atmosphere
											holds more water vapor
											with its latent energy,
											rainfall will become
											in more extreme events.
											There will be stronger storms and greater flooding.
											Global warming hoopla
											became time-consuming
											and distracted me from doing science —

											By 15 years later,
											evidence of global warming was much stronger.
											Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper
											were facts.
											I had the privilege to speak twice
											to the president&#39;s climate task force.
											But energy policies continued to focus
											on finding more fossil fuels.
											By then we had two grandchildren,
											Sophie and Connor.
											I decided
											that I did not want them in the future
											to say, &quot;Opa understood what was happening,
											but he didn&#39;t make it clear.&quot;
											So I decided to give a public talk

											I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004

											of the American Geophysical Union.
											This led to calls

											and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media

											After I informed the New York Times
											about these restrictions,
											NASA was forced to end the censorship.
											But there were consequences.
											I had been using the first line

											Over the next few years
											I was drawn more and more
											into trying to communicate the urgency
											of a change in energy policies,
											while still researching the physics of climate change.
											Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics —
											first, from Earth&#39;s energy balance
											and, second, from Earth&#39;s climate history.

											Adding CO2 to the air
											is like throwing another blanket on the bed.
											It reduces Earth&#39;s heat radiation to space,
											so there&#39;s a temporary energy imbalance.
											More energy is coming in
											than going out,
											until Earth warms up enough
											to again radiate to space
											as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun.
											So the key quantity
											is Earth&#39;s energy imbalance.
											Is there more energy coming in
											than going out?
											If so, more warming is in the pipeline.
											It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses.

									<p>
											Now finally,
											we can measure Earth&#39;s energy imbalance precisely
											by measuring the heat content
											in Earth&#39;s heat reservoirs.
											The biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured,
											until more than 3,000 Argo floats
											were distributed around the world&#39;s ocean.
											These floats reveal
											that the upper half of the ocean
											is gaining heat at a substantial rate.
											The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate,
											and energy is going
											into the net melting of ice all around the planet.
											And the land, to depths of tens of meters,
											is also warming.

											The total energy imbalance now
											is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.
											That may not sound like much,
											but when added up over the whole world, it&#39;s enormous.
											It&#39;s about 20 times greater
											than the rate of energy use by all of humanity.
											It&#39;s equivalent to exploding
											400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day
											365 days per year.
											That&#39;s how much extra energy
											Earth is gaining each day.
											This imbalance,
											if we want to stabilize climate,
											means that we must reduce CO2
											from 391 ppm, parts per million,
											back to 350 ppm.
											That is the change needed to restore energy balance
											and prevent further warming.

											Climate change deniers argue
											that the Sun is the main cause of climate change.
											But the measured energy imbalance occurred
											during the deepest solar minimum in the record,
											when the Sun&#39;s energy reaching Earth was least.
											Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out.
											This shows that the effect of the Sun&#39;s variations on climate
											is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses,
											mainly from burning fossil fuels.

											Now consider Earth&#39;s climate history.
											These curves for global temperature,
											atmospheric CO2 and sea level
											were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores,
											from ocean sediments and snowflakes
											that piled up year after year
											over 800,000 years
											forming a two-mile thick ice sheet.
											As you see, there&#39;s a high correlation
											between temperature, CO2 and sea level.
											Careful examination shows
											that the temperature changes
											slightly lead the CO2 changes
											by a few centuries.
											Climate change deniers like to use this fact
											to confuse and trick the public
											by saying, &quot;Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change,
											not vice versa.&quot;

											Small changes in Earth&#39;s orbit
											that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years
											alter the distribution
											of sunlight on Earth.
											When there is more sunlight
											at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt.
											Shrinking ice sheets
											make the planet darker,
											so it absorbs more sunlight
											and becomes warmer.
											A warmer ocean releases CO2,
											just as a warm Coca-Cola does.
											And more CO2 causes more warming.
											So CO2, methane, and ice sheets
											were feedbacks
											that amplified global temperature change
											causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge,
											even though the climate change was initiated
											by a very weak forcing.

											The important point
											is that these same amplifying feedbacks
											will occur today.
											The physics does not change.
											As Earth warms,
											now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere,
											ice will melt,
											and CO2 and methane will be released
											by warming ocean and melting permafrost.
											While we can&#39;t say exactly how fast
											these amplifying feedbacks will occur,
											it is certain they will occur,
											unless we stop the warming.
											There is evidence
											that feedbacks are already beginning.
											Precise measurements
											by GRACE, the gravity satellite,
											reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica
											are now losing mass,
											several hundred cubic kilometers per year.
											And the rate has accelerated

											Global warming is already affecting people.
											The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico
											heatwave and drought last year,
											Moscow the year before

											Fifty years ago,

											An important impact,

University&rsquo;s Earth Institute. He was trained in physics and astronomy in the space science program of James Van Allen at the University of Iowa. His early research on the clouds of Venus helped identify their composition as sulfuric acid. Since the late 1970s, he has focused his research on Earth&#39;s climate, especially human-made climate change. From 1981 to 2013, he headed the NASA Godard Institute for Space Studies. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Hansen is known for his testimony on climate change to congressional committees in the 1980s that helped raise broad awareness of the global warming issue. Hansen is recognized for speaking truth to power, for identifying ineffectual policies as greenwash, and for outlining the actions that the public must take to protect the future of young people and the other species on the planet. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"James Hansen","tags":["big problems","climate change","environment","global issues","science"],"title":"Why I must speak out about climate change","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1315939}]}
