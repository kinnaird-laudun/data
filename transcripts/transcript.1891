											Tonight, I want to talk about
a tale of two cities.
											One of those cities is called Washington,
and the other is called Beijing.
											Because how these two capitals
shape their future
											and the future of the United States
and the future of China
											doesn&#39;t just affect those two countries,
											it affects all of us
											in ways, perhaps, we&#39;ve never thought of:
											the air we breathe, the water we drink,
											the fish we eat,
the quality of our oceans,
											the languages we speak in the future,
											the jobs we have,
the political systems we choose,
											and, of course, the great questions
of war and peace.

											You see that bloke? He&#39;s French.
											His name is Napoleon.
											A couple of hundred years ago,
											he made this extraordinary projection:
											&quot;China is a sleeping lion,
and when she awakes,
											the world will shake.&quot;
											Napoleon got a few things wrong;
											he got this one absolutely right.
											Because China is today
not just woken up,
											China has stood up
and China is on the march,
											and the question for us all
											is where will China go
											and how do we engage
this giant of the 21st century?

											You start looking at the numbers,
they start to confront you in a big way.
											It&#39;s projected that China will become,
											by whichever measure —
PPP, market exchange rates —
											the largest economy in the world
											over the course of the decade ahead.
											They&#39;re already
the largest trading nation,
											already the largest exporting nation,
											already the largest manufacturing nation,
											and they&#39;re also the biggest
emitters of carbon in the world.
											America comes second.

									<p>
											So if China does become
the world&#39;s largest economy,
											think about this:
											It&#39;ll be the first time
											since this guy was on
the throne of England —
											George III, not a good friend
of Napoleon&#39;s —
											that in the world we will have
as the largest economy
											a non-English speaking country,
											a non-Western country,
											a non-liberal democratic country.
											And if you don&#39;t think
that&#39;s going to affect
											the way in which the world
happens in the future,
											then personally, I think
you&#39;ve been smoking something,
											and it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re from Colorado.

											So in short, the question
we have tonight is,
											how do we understand this mega-change,
											which I believe to be the biggest change
for the first half of the 21st century?
											It&#39;ll affect so many things.
											It will go to the absolute core.
											It&#39;s happening quietly.
It&#39;s happening persistently.
											It&#39;s happening in some senses
under the radar,
											as we are all preoccupied with
											what&#39;s going in Ukraine,
what&#39;s going on in the Middle East,
											what&#39;s going on with ISIS,
what&#39;s going on with ISIL,
											what&#39;s happening with
the future of our economies.
											This is a slow and quiet revolution.
											And with a mega-change
comes also a mega-challenge,
											and the mega-challenge is this:
											Can these two great countries,
											China and the United States —
											China,
											the Middle Kingdom,
											and the United States,
											Měiguó —
											which in Chinese, by the way,
means &quot;the beautiful country.&quot;
											Think about that — that&#39;s the name
that China has given this country
											for more than a hundred years.
											Whether these two great civilizations,
these two great countries,
											can in fact carve out a common future
											for themselves and for the world?
											In short, can we carve out a future
											which is peaceful and mutually prosperous,
											or are we looking at a great challenge
											of war or peace?
											And I have 15 minutes
to work through war or peace,
											which is a little less time
											than they gave this guy to write a book
called &quot;War and Peace.&quot;

											People ask me, why is it that a kid
growing up in rural Australia
											got interested in learning Chinese?
											Well, there are two reasons for that.
											Here&#39;s the first of them.
											That&#39;s Betsy the cow.
											Now, Betsy the cow was one
of a herd of dairy cattle
											that I grew up with on a farm
in rural Australia.
											See those hands there?
These are not built for farming.
											So very early on, I discovered
that in fact, working in a farm
											was not designed for me,
and China was a very safe remove
											from any career in Australian farm life.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Here&#39;s the second reason.
											That&#39;s my mom.
											Anyone here ever listen
to what their mom told them to do?
											Everyone ever do what
their mom told them to do?
											I rarely did,
											but what my mom said to me was,
											one day, she handed me a newspaper,
											a headline which said,
here we have a huge change.
											And that change is China
entering the United Nations.
											1971, I had just turned 14 years of age,
											and she handed me this headline.
											And she said, &quot;Understand this, 
learn this,
											because it&#39;s going to affect your future.&quot;

									<p>
											So being a very good student of history,
											I decided that the best thing
for me to do was, in fact,
											to go off and learn Chinese.
											The great thing about learning Chinese
											is that your Chinese teacher
gives you a new name.
											And so they gave me this name:
											Kè, which means to overcome or to conquer,
											and Wén, and that&#39;s the character
for literature or the arts.
											Kè Wén, Conqueror of the Classics.
											Any of you guys called &quot;Kevin&quot;?
											It&#39;s a major lift from being called Kevin
to be called Conqueror of the Classics.
											(Laughter)
											I&#39;ve been called Kevin all my life.
											Have you been called Kevin all your life?
											Would you prefer to be called
Conqueror of the Classics?

											And so I went off after that
and joined the Australian Foreign Service,
											but here is where pride — before pride,
there always comes a fall.
											So there I am in the embassy in Beijing,
											off to the Great Hall of the People
											with our ambassador, who had asked me
to interpret for his first meeting
											in the Great Hall of the People.
											And so there was I.
											If you&#39;ve been to a Chinese meeting,
it&#39;s a giant horseshoe.
											At the head of the horsehoe
are the really serious pooh-bahs,
											and down the end of the horseshoe
are the not-so-serious pooh-bahs,
											the junior woodchucks like me.
											And so the ambassador
began with this inelegant phrase.
											He said, &quot;China and Australia
are currently enjoying a relationship
											of unprecedented closeness.&quot;
											And I thought to myself,
											&quot;That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd.
											I will improve it.&quot;
											Note to file: Never do that.
											It needed to be a little more elegant,
a little more classical,
											so I rendered it as follows.

											There was a big pause
on the other side of the room.
											You could see the giant pooh-bahs
at the head of the horseshoe,
											the blood visibly draining
from their faces,
											and the junior woodchucks
at the other end of the horseshoe
											engaged in peals of 
unrestrained laughter.
											Because when I rendered his sentence,
											&quot;Australia and China are 
enjoying a relationship
											of unprecedented closeness,&quot;
											in fact, what I said was that
Australia and China
											were now experiencing fantastic orgasm.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Let me first go to, in fact,
											China&#39;s views of the U.S.
and the rest of the West.
											Number one: China feels
as if it&#39;s been humiliated
											at the hands of the West
through a hundred years of history,
											beginning with the Opium Wars.
											When after that, the Western powers
carved China up into little pieces,
											so that by the time
it got to the &#39;20s and &#39;30s,
											signs like this one appeared
on the streets of Shanghai.
											[&quot;No dogs and Chinese allowed&quot;]
											How would you feel if you were Chinese, 

											in your own country, 
if you saw that sign appear?
											China also believes and feels
											as if, in the events of 1919,
at the Peace Conference in Paris,
											when Germany&#39;s colonies were given back
											to all sorts of countries
around in the world,
											what about German colonies in China?
											They were, in fact, given to Japan.
											When Japan then invaded China in the 1930s
											the world looked away and was indifferent
to what would happen to China.
											And then, on top of that,
the Chinese to this day believe
											that the United States and the West
											do not accept the legitimacy
of their political system
											because it&#39;s so radically different
from those of us who come
											from liberal democracies,
											and believe that the United States
to this day is seeking
											to undermine their political system.
											China also believes
that it is being contained
											by U.S. allies and by those
with strategic partnerships with the U.S.
											right around its periphery.
											And beyond all that,
the Chinese have this feeling
											in their heart of hearts
and in their gut of guts
											that those of us in the collective West
											are just too damned arrogant.
											That is, we don&#39;t recognize
the problems in our own system,
											in our politics and our economics,
											and are very quick
to point the finger elsewhere,
											and believe that, in fact,
we in the collective West
											are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Of course, in international relations,
											it&#39;s not just the sound
of one hand clapping.
											There&#39;s another country too,
and that&#39;s called the U.S.
											So how does the U.S.
respond to all of the above?
											The U.S. has a response to each of those.
											On the question of
is the U.S. containing China,
											they say, &quot;No, look at the history of
the Soviet Union. That was containment.&quot;
											Instead, what we have done
in the U.S. and the West
											is welcome China
into the global economy,
											and on top of that, welcome them
into the World Trade Organization.
											The U.S. and the West say China cheats
											on the question
of intellectual property rights,
											and through cyberattacks
on U.S. and global firms.
											Furthermore, the United States
says that the Chinese political system
											is fundamentally wrong
											because it&#39;s at such fundamental variance
											to the human rights, democracy,
and rule of law that we enjoy
											in the U.S. and the collective West.
											And on top of all the above,
what does the United States say?
											That they fear that China will,
when it has sufficient power,
											establish a sphere of influence
in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia,
											boot the United States out,
											and in time, when it&#39;s powerful enough,
											unilaterally seek to change
the rules of the global order.

											So apart from all of that,
it&#39;s just fine and dandy,
											the U.S.-China relationship.

											The challenge, though,
is given those deep-rooted feelings,
											those deep-rooted emotions
and thought patterns,

ways of thinking,
											how can we craft a basis
for a common future between these two?

									<p>
											I argue simply this:
											We can do it on the basis on a framework
											of constructive realism
for a common purpose.
											What do I mean by that?
											Be realistic about the things
that we disagree on,
											and a management approach
that doesn&#39;t enable
											any one of those differences
to break into war or conflict
											until we&#39;ve acquired
the diplomatic skills to solve them.
											Be constructive in areas of the
bilateral, regional and global engagement
											between the two,
											which will make a difference
for all of humankind.
											Build a regional institution
capable of cooperation in Asia,
											an Asia-Pacific community.
											And worldwide, act further,
											like you&#39;ve begun to do
at the end of last year
											by striking out against climate change
											with hands joined together

											The important thing that I remember
is staring in the faces

											It was extraordinary to see, for example,
											old women telling me the stories
of when they were five years old
											and literally ripped away
from their parents,
											like this lady here.
											It was extraordinary for me
to then be able to embrace
											and to kiss Aboriginal elders

this family saying to me,

											to come to this thing,
											drove our way through redneck country.
											On the way back, stopped at a cafe
after the apology for a milkshake.&quot;
											And they walked into this cafe
quietly, tentatively, gingerly,
											a little anxious.
											I think you know what I&#39;m talking about.
											But the day after the apology,
what happened?
											Everyone in that cafe,
every one of the white folks,
											stood up and applauded.
											Something had happened in the hearts
of these people in Australia.
											The white folks, our Aboriginal
brothers and sisters,
											and we haven&#39;t solved
all these problems together,
											but let me tell you,
there was a new beginning
											because we had gone not just to the head,
											we&#39;d gone also to the heart.

											So where does that conclude
in terms of the great question
											that we&#39;ve been asked
to address this evening,
											which is the future
of U.S.-China relations?
											The head says there&#39;s a way forward.
											The head says there is a policy framework,
there&#39;s a common narrative,
											there&#39;s a mechanism
through regular summitry
											to do these things
