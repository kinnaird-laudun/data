											I&#39;m going to talk to you about optimism —
											or more precisely, the optimism bias.
											It&#39;s a cognitive illusion
											that we&#39;ve been studying in my lab for the past few years,
											and 80 percent of us have it.
									</p>
								</div>

									<p>
											It&#39;s our tendency to overestimate
											our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives
											and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.
											So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer,
											being in a car accident.
											We overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.
											In short, we&#39;re more optimistic than realistic,
											but we are oblivious to the fact.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

									<p>
											Take marriage for example.
											In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.
											That means that out of five married couples,
											two will end up splitting their assets.
											But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce,
											they estimate it at zero percent.
											And even divorce lawyers, who should really know better,
											hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce.
											So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce,
											but they are more likely to remarry.
											In the words of Samuel Johnson,
											&quot;Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience.&quot;

											So if we&#39;re married, we&#39;re more likely to have kids.
											And we all think our kids will be especially talented.
											This, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy.
											And I just want to make it absolutely clear
											that he&#39;s a really bad example of the optimism bias,
											because he is in fact uniquely talented.

											And I&#39;m not alone.
											Out of four British people, three said
											that they were optimistic about the future of their own families.
											That&#39;s 75 percent.
											But only 30 percent said
											that they thought families in general
											are doing better than a few generations ago.

											And this is a really important point,
											because we&#39;re optimistic about ourselves,
											we&#39;re optimistic about our kids,
											we&#39;re optimistic about our families,
											but we&#39;re not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us,
											and we&#39;re somewhat pessimistic
											about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country.
											But private optimism about our own personal future
											remains persistent.
											And it doesn&#39;t mean that we think things will magically turn out okay,
											but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.

											Okay, that&#39;s about 10 people out of 1,500.
											Who believes they&#39;re at the top 25 percent?
											That&#39;s most of us here.
											Okay, now do the same for your driving ability.
											How interesting are you?
											How attractive are you?
											How honest are you?
											And finally, how modest are you?

											So most of us put ourselves above average

											Now this is statistically impossible.
											We can&#39;t all be better than everyone else.
											(Laughter)

											And it&#39;s a global phenomenon.
											The optimism bias has been observed

											But the question is, is it good for us?
											So some people say no.
											Some people say the secret to happiness
											is low expectations.
											I think the logic goes something like this:
											If we don&#39;t expect greatness,
											if we don&#39;t expect to find love and be healthy and successful,
											well we&#39;re not going to be disappointed when these things don&#39;t happen.
											And if we&#39;re not disappointed when good things don&#39;t happen,
											and we&#39;re pleasantly surprised when they do,

											So it&#39;s a very good theory,
											but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons.
											Number one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail,
											people with high expectations always feel better.
											Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month
											depends on how we interpret that event.

											The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown
											studied students with high and low expectations.
											And they found that when people with high expectations succeed,
											they attribute that success to their own traits.
											&quot;I&#39;m a genius, therefore I got an A,
											therefore I&#39;ll get an A again and again in the future.&quot;
											When they failed, it wasn&#39;t because they were dumb,
											but because the exam just happened to be unfair.
											Next time they will do better.
											People with low expectations do the opposite.
											So when they failed it was because they were dumb,
											and when they succeeded
											it was because the exam just happened to be really easy.
											Next time reality would catch up with them.
											So they felt worse.

											Number two: Regardless of the outcome,
											the pure act of anticipation makes us happy.
											The behavioral economist George Lowenstein
											asked students in his university
											to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity.
											Then he said, &quot;How much are you willing to pay
											to get a kiss from a celebrity
											if the kiss was delivered immediately,
											in three hours, in 24 hours, in three days,
											in one year, in 10 years?
											He found that the students were willing to pay the most
											not to get a kiss immediately,
											but to get a kiss in three days.
											They were willing to pay extra in order to wait.
											Now they weren&#39;t willing to wait a year or 10 years;
											no one wants an aging celebrity.
											But three days seemed to be the optimum amount.

											Well if you get the kiss now, it&#39;s over and done with.
											But if you get the kiss in three days,
											well that&#39;s three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait.
											The students wanted that time
											to imagine where is it going to happen,
											how is it going to happen.
											Anticipation made them happy.

											This is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday.
											It&#39;s a really curious fact,
											because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure,
											so you&#39;d assume that people will prefer Sunday,
											but they don&#39;t.
											It&#39;s not because they really, really like being in the office
											and they can&#39;t stand strolling in the park
											or having a lazy brunch.
											We know that, because when you ask people
											about their ultimate favorite day of the week,
											surprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first,
											then Friday, then Sunday.
											People prefer Friday
											because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead,
											all the plans that you have.
											On Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to
											is the work week.

											So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future,
											more strolls in the park.
											And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing.
											In fact, without the optimism bias,
											we would all be slightly depressed.
											People with mild depression,
											they don&#39;t have a bias when they look into the future.
											They&#39;re actually more realistic than healthy individuals.
											But individuals with severe depression,
											they have a pessimistic bias.
											So they tend to expect the future
											to be worse than it ends up being.

											So optimism changes subjective reality.
											The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it.
											But it also changes objective reality.
											It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
											And that is the third reason
											why lowering your expectations will not make you happy.
											Controlled experiments have shown
											that optimism is not only related to success,
											it leads to success.
											Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics.
											And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health.
											If we expect the future to be bright,
											stress and anxiety are reduced.

											So all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.
											But the question that was really confusing to me was,
											how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?
											As an neuroscientist, this was especially confusing,
											because according to all the theories out there,
											when your expectations are not met, you should alter them.
											But this is not what we find.
											We asked people to come into our lab
											in order to try and figure out what was going on.

											We asked them to estimate their likelihood
											of experiencing different terrible events in their lives.
											So, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer?
											And then we told them the average likelihood
											of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes.
											So cancer, for example, is about 30 percent.
											And then we asked them again,
											&quot;How likely are you to suffer from cancer?&quot;

											What we wanted to know was
											whether people will take the information that we gave them
											to change their beliefs.
											And indeed they did —
											but mostly when the information we gave them
											was better than what they expected.
											So for example,
											if someone said, &quot;My likelihood of suffering from cancer
											is about 50 percent,&quot;
											and we said, &quot;Hey, good news.
											The average likelihood is only 30 percent,&quot;
											the next time around they would say,
											&quot;Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent.&quot;
											So they learned quickly and efficiently.
											But if someone started off saying,
											&quot;My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent,&quot;
											and we said, &quot;Hey, bad news.
											The average likelihood is about 30 percent,&quot;
											the next time around they would say,
											&quot;Yep. Still think it&#39;s about 11 percent.&quot;

											But at the same time,
											when we hear that the housing market is hopeful,

											To try and figure that out,
											I asked the participants in the experiment

											One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.
											So if someone said, &quot;My likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent,&quot;
											and we said, &quot;Hey, good news.
											Average likelihood is 30 percent,&quot;
											the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely.
											And it didn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re an extreme optimist, a mild optimist

											On the other side of the brain,

											the less likely this region was
											to respond to unexpected negative information.
											And if your brain is failing

											So let&#39;s see what happens.

											the average amount of bias that we see.
											So if I was to test all of you now,
											this is the amount that you would learn
											more from good news relative to bad news.
											Now we interfere with the region
											that we found to integrate negative information in this task,
											and the optimism bias grew even larger.
											We made people more biased in the way that they process information.
											Then we interfered with the brain region
											that we found to integrate good news in this task,

											And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves,
											would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits?
											If we could do that, would we want to take people&#39;s optimism bias away?
											Well I&#39;ve already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias,

											The key here really is knowledge.
											We&#39;re not born with an innate understanding of our biases.

											does not shatter the illusion.
											It&#39;s like visual illusions,

And most of us display this bias. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot wants to know why: What is it about our brains that makes us overestimate the positive? She explores the question in her book<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://geni.us/optimismbias\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Optimism Bias: A Tour of the Irrationally Positive Brain</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p><p>In the book (and a 2011 <em>TIME</em> magazine cover story), she reviewed findings from both social science and neuroscience that point to an interesting conclusion: &quot;our brains aren&#39;t just stamped by the past. They are constantly being shaped by the future.&quot; In her own work, she&#39;s interested in how our natural optimism actually shapes what we remember, and her interesting range of papers encompasses behavioral research (how likely we are to misremember major events) as well as medical findings -- like searching for the places in the brain where optimism lives. Sharot is a faculty member of the Department of Cognitive, Perceptual and Brain Sciences at University College London.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Tali Sharot","tags":["brain","culture","neuroscience","psychology","science","happiness","sociology","decision-making","cognitive science","behavioral economics","life","mind","personality"],"title":"The optimism bias","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2112680}]}
