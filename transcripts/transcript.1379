<meta content='In long-term relationships, we often expect our beloved to be both best friend and erotic partner. But as Esther Perel argues, good and committed sex draws on two conflicting needs: our need for security and our need for surprise. So how do you sustain desire? With wit and eloquence, Perel lets us in on the mystery of erotic intelligence.' itemprop='description'>

											So, why does good sex so often fade,
											even for couples who continue
to love each other as much as ever?
											And why does good intimacy
not guarantee good sex,
											contrary to popular belief?
											Or, the next question would be,
											can we want what we already have?
											That&#39;s the million-dollar question, right?
											And why is the forbidden so erotic?
											What is it about transgression
that makes desire so potent?
											And why does sex make babies,
											and babies spell erotic
disaster in couples?

											These are some of the questions
											that are at the center of my exploration
on the nature of erotic desire
											and its concomitant
dilemmas in modern love.
											So I travel the globe,
											and what I&#39;m noticing is that everywhere
where romanticism has entered,
											there seems to be a crisis of desire.
											A crisis of desire,
as in owning the wanting —
											desire as an expression
of our individuality,
											of our free choice,
of our preferences, of our identity —
											desire that has become a central concept
											as part of modern love
and individualistic societies.

											You know, this is the first time
in the history of humankind
											where we are trying to experience
sexuality in the long term
											not because we want 14 children,
											for which we need to have even more
because many of them won&#39;t make it,
											and not because it is exclusively
a woman&#39;s marital duty.
											This is the first time
that we want sex over time
											about pleasure and connection
that is rooted in desire.

											So what sustains desire,
and why is it so difficult?
											And at the heart of sustaining
desire in a committed relationship,
											I think, is the reconciliation
of two fundamental human needs.
											On the one hand, our need
for security, for predictability,
											for safety, for dependability,
											for reliability, for permanence.
											All these anchoring,
grounding experiences of our lives
											that we call home.
											But we also have an equally
strong need — men and women —
											for adventure, for novelty,
											for mystery, for risk, for danger,
											for the unknown,
for the unexpected, surprise —
											you get the gist.
											For journey, for travel.

									<p>
											So reconciling our need for security
and our need for adventure
											into one relationship,
											or what we today like to call
a passionate marriage,
											used to be a contradiction in terms.
											Marriage was an economic institution
											in which you were
given a partnership for life
											in terms of children and social status
											and succession and companionship.
											But now we want our partner
to still give us all these things,
											but in addition I want you
to be my best friend
											and my trusted confidant
and my passionate lover to boot,
											and we live twice as long.

and mystery and awe all in one.
											Give me comfort, give me edge.

the mystery of eroticism.

											So if there is a verb, for me,
that comes with love, it&#39;s &quot;to have.&quot;
											And if there is a verb that comes
with desire, it is &quot;to want.&quot;
											In love, we want to have,
we want to know the beloved.
											We want to minimize the distance.
											We want to contract that gap.
											We want to neutralize the tensions.
											We want closeness.
											But in desire,
											we tend to not really want to go back
to the places we&#39;ve already gone.
											Forgone conclusion
does not keep our interest.
											In desire, we want an Other,
											somebody on the other side
that we can go visit,
											that we can go spend some time with,
											that we can go see what goes on
in their red-light district.
											You know?
											In desire, we want a bridge to cross.
											Or in other words,
I sometimes say, fire needs air.
											Desire needs space.
											And when it&#39;s said like that,
it&#39;s often quite abstract.

											But then I took a question with me.
											And I&#39;ve gone to more than 20 countries
in the last few years
											with &quot;Mating in Captivity,&quot;
and I asked people,
											when do you find yourself
most drawn to your partner?
											Not attracted sexually,
per Se, but most drawn.
											And across culture, across religion,
and across gender — except for one —
											there are a few answers
that just keep coming back.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the first group is:
											I am most drawn to my partner
when she is away,
											when we are apart, when we reunite.
											Basically, when I get back in touch
											with my ability to imagine myself
with my partner,
											when my imagination comes
back in the picture,
											and when I can root it
in absence and in longing,
											which is a major component of desire.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But then the second group
is even more interesting.
											I am most drawn to my partner
											when I see him in the studio,
											when she is onstage,
											when he is in his element,
											when she&#39;s doing something
she&#39;s passionate about,
											when I see him at a party
and other people are really drawn to him,
											when I see her hold court.
											Basically, when I look at my partner
radiant and confident.
											Probably the biggest
turn-on across the board.
											Radiant, as in self-sustaining.
											I look at this person —
by the way, in desire
											people rarely talk about it,
when we are blended into one,
											five centimeters from each other.
											I don&#39;t know in inches how much that is.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But it&#39;s also not when the other person
is that far apart
											that you no longer see them.
											It&#39;s when I&#39;m looking at my partner
from a comfortable distance,
											where this person that is already
so familiar, so known,
											is momentarily once again
somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.
											And in this space between me
and the other lies the erotic élan,
											lies that movement toward the other.
											Because sometimes, as Proust says,
											mystery is not
about traveling to new places,
											but it&#39;s about looking with new eyes.
											And so, when I see my partner
on his own or her own,
											doing something
in which they are enveloped,
											I look at this person and I momentarily
get a shift in perception,
											and I stay open to the mysteries
that are living right next to me.

											And then, more importantly,
in this description about the other
											or myself — it&#39;s the same —
											what is most interesting
is that there is no neediness in desire.

											There is no caretaking in desire.
											Caretaking is mightily loving.

											And then the third group
of answers usually would be:
											when I&#39;m surprised,
when we laugh together,
											as somebody said to me
in the office today,
											when he&#39;s in his tux, so I said, you know,
											it&#39;s either the tux or the cowboy boots.
											But basically it&#39;s when there is novelty.
											But novelty isn&#39;t about new positions.
											It isn&#39;t a repertoire of techniques.
											Novelty is, what parts
of you do you bring out?
											What parts of you are just being seen?

											Because in some way one could say
sex isn&#39;t something you do, eh?
											Sex is a place you go.
											It&#39;s a space you enter
											inside yourself
and with another, or others.
											So where do you go in sex?
											What parts of you do you connect to?
											What do you seek to express there?
											Is it a place for transcendence
and spiritual union?
											Is it a place for naughtiness
and is it a place to be safely aggressive?
											Is it a place where you
can finally surrender
											and not have to take
responsibility for everything?
											Is it a place where you can
express your infantile wishes?
											What comes out there? It&#39;s a language.
											It isn&#39;t just a behavior.
											And it&#39;s the poetic of that language
that I&#39;m interested in,
											which is why I began to explore
this concept of erotic intelligence.

											You know, animals have sex.

it&#39;s the natural instinct.
											We are the only ones
who have an erotic life,

transformed by the human imagination.
											We are the only ones
who can make love for hours,
											have a blissful time, multiple orgasms,
											and touch nobody,
just because we can imagine it.
											We can hint at it.
We don&#39;t even have to do it.
											We can experience that powerful
thing called anticipation,
											which is a mortar to desire.
											The ability to imagine it,
as if it&#39;s happening,
											to experience it as if it&#39;s happening,
											while nothing is happening
											and everything is happening,
at the same time.

											So when I began to think about eroticism,

											Imagination, playfulness,
											novelty, curiosity, mystery.

that piece called the imagination.

									<p>
											But more importantly,
for me to begin to understand
											who are the couples
who have an erotic spark,
											what sustains desire,
											I had to go back
to the original definition of eroticism,
											the mystical definition,
											and I went through it
through a bifurcation
											by looking, actually, at trauma,
											which is the other side.
											And I looked at it,
											looking at the community
that I had grown up in,
											which was a community in Belgium,
all Holocaust survivors,
											and in my community,
there were two groups:
											those who didn&#39;t die,
and those who came back to life.
											And those who didn&#39;t die lived
often very tethered to the ground,
											could not experience
pleasure, could not trust,
											because when you&#39;re vigilant,
worried, anxious, and insecure,
											you can&#39;t lift your head
to go and take off in space
											and be playful and safe and imaginative.
											Those who came back to life
											were those who understood
the erotic as an antidote to death.
											They knew how to keep themselves alive.
											And when I began to listen
											to the sexlessness
of the couples that I work with,
											I sometimes would hear people
say, &quot;I want more sex,&quot;
											but generally, people want better sex,
											and better is to reconnect
with that quality of aliveness,
											of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality,
											of Eros, of energy
											that sex used to afford them,
											or that they&#39;ve hoped
it would afford them.

											And so I began to ask
a different question.
											&quot;I shut myself off when ...&quot;
began to be the question.
											&quot;I turn off my desires when ...&quot;

											&quot;What turns me off is ...&quot;
and &quot;You turn me off when ...&quot;
											And people began to say,
&quot;I turn myself off when
											I feel dead inside,
when I don&#39;t like my body,
											when I feel old,
											when I haven&#39;t had time for myself,
											when I haven&#39;t had a chance
to even check in with you,
											when I don&#39;t perform well at work,
											when I feel low self esteem,

of the other and not in your own.

											So in this dilemma about reconciling
these two sets of fundamental needs,
											there are a few things that I&#39;ve come
to understand erotic couples do.
											One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.
											They understand
that there is an erotic space
											that belongs to each of them.
											They also understand
that foreplay is not something you do
											five minutes before the real thing.
											Foreplay pretty much starts
at the end of the previous orgasm.
											They also understand
that an erotic space isn&#39;t about,
											you begin to stroke the other.
											It&#39;s about you create a space
where you leave Management Inc.,
											maybe where you leave the Agile program —

where you stop being the good citizen
											who is taking care of things
and being responsible.

									<p>
											Responsibility and desire just butt heads.
											They don&#39;t really do well together.
											Erotic couples also understand
that passion waxes and wanes.
											It&#39;s pretty much like the moon.
											It has intermittent eclipses.
											But what they know
is they know how to resurrect it.
											They know how to bring it back.
											And they know how to bring it back
											because they have
demystified one big myth,
											which is the myth of spontaneity,
											which is that it&#39;s just going
to fall from heaven
											while you&#39;re folding the laundry
like a deus ex machina,
											and in fact they understood
											that whatever is going to just happen
in a long-term relationship, already has.

But how? Perel, a licensed marriage and family therapist with a practice in New York, travels the world to help people answer this question. For her research she works across cultures and is fluent in nine languages. She coaches, consults and speaks regularly on erotic intelligence, trauma, sexual honesty and conflict resolution. She is the author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence/dp/0060753641\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mating in Captivity: Reconciling the Erotic and the Domestic</em></a>. Her latest work focuses on infidelity: what it is, why happy people do it and how couples can recover from it.&nbsp;She aims to locate this very personal experience within a larger cultural context.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Esther Perel","tags":["culture","love","relationships","sex"],"title":"The secret to desire in a long-term relationship","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":12154248}]}
