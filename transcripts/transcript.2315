<title>Sarah Parcak: Help discover ancient ruins -- before it&#39;s too late | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Sarah Parcak uses satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above Earth to uncover hidden ancient treasures buried beneath our feet. There&#39;s a lot to discover; in the Egyptian Delta alone, Parcak estimates we&#39;ve excavated less than a thousandth of one percent of what&#39;s out there. Now, with the 2016 TED Prize and an infectious enthusiasm for archaeology, she&#39;s developed an online platform called GlobalXplorer that enables anyone with an internet connection to discover unknown sites and protect what remains of our shared human inheritance." />

<meta content="Sarah Parcak uses satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above Earth to uncover hidden ancient treasures buried beneath our feet. There's a lot to discover; in the Egyptian Delta alone, Parcak estimates we've excavated less than a thousandth of one percent of what's out there. Now, with the 2016 TED Prize and an infectious enthusiasm for archaeology, she's developed an online platform called GlobalXplorer that enables anyone with an internet connection to discover unknown sites and protect what remains of our shared human inheritance." itemprop='description'>

											This began an incredible
archaeological partnership.
											Years later, I proposed to him

											of the Prince and Princess
Rahotep and Nofret,

in front of two people

											The thrill of archaeological discovery
is as powerful as love,
											because ancient history is the most
seductive mistress imaginable.

											On my first day in Egypt,
I worked at a site
											in the Northeast Egyptian Delta
called Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago,
											in a cemetery.
											That&#39;s a picture of me —
											I&#39;m just in my bliss.
											On the dig, surrounded
by emerald green rice paddies,
											I discovered an intact pot.
											Flipping it over,
											I discovered a human thumbprint
left by whoever made the vessel.
											For a moment, time stood still.
											I didn&#39;t know where I was.
											It was because at that moment I realized,
											when we dig,
											we&#39;re digging for people,
											not things.

											Never are we so present as when
we are in the midst of the great past.
											I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve stood
in front of the Pyramids of Giza,
											and they leave me speechless.
											I feel like the luckiest
person in the world.
											They&#39;re a monument to our human brilliance
and everything that is possible.
											Many cannot process
their brilliance as human —
											they think aliens built them.
											But this is ridiculous.
											All you need to do
is get up close and personal,
											and see the hidden hand of man
											in the chisel marks left
by the tools that built them.
											The Great Pyramid of Giza
was built one stone at a time
											with 2.3 million blocks,
											with incredible bureaucratic efficiency.
											It is not the pyramids
that stand the test of time;
											it is human ingenuity.
											That is our shared human brilliance.
											History may be cyclical,

											But we have a challenge.
											Over the last year,

to archaeological sites,

											ISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra.
											Who blows up a temple?
											They&#39;ve destroyed the Tomb of Jonah.
											And we&#39;ve seen looting
at sites so rampant,
											it looks like craters of the moon.
											Knowing ISIL&#39;s desire to destroy
modern human lives,
											it&#39;s a natural extension for them
to destroy cultural identity as well.
											Countless invading armies
have done the same throughout history.

									<p>
											We know that ISIL is profiting
from the looting of sites,
											but we don&#39;t know the scale.
											This means that any object
purchased on the market today
											from the Middle East
											could potentially be funding terrorism.
											When a site is looted,
											it&#39;s as if a puzzle already missing
90 percent of it pieces
											has had the rest obscured
beyond recognition.
											This is ancient identity theft writ large.
											We know that there are two kinds
of looting going on:
											looting by criminal elements like ISIL,
											and then more local looting
by those that are desperate for money.
											We would all do the same
to feed our families;
											I don&#39;t blame the local looters.
											I blame the middlemen,
the unethical traffickers
											and an international art market
											that exploits often ambiguous
or even completely nonexistent laws.

											We know looting is going on
on a global scale and it&#39;s increasing,
											but presently we don&#39;t have
any tools to stop it.
											This is beginning to change.
											My team and I have just completed a study
looking at looting in Egypt.
											We looked at open-source data
											and mapped the entirety
of looting across Egypt
											from 2002 to 2013.
											We found evidence of looting
and site destruction at 267 sites,
											and mapped over 200,000 looting pits.
											It&#39;s astonishing.
											And putting that data together —
											you can see the looting pits marked here.
											At one site, the looting got bad
from 2009, 2011, 2012 —
											hundreds and hundreds of pits.

											Putting all the data together,
											what we found is that,
contrary to popular opinion,
											looting did not start to get worse
in Egypt in 2011 after the Arab Spring,
											but in 2009, after the global recession.
											Thus, we&#39;ve shown with big data
											that looting is fundamentally
an economic issue.
											If we do nothing to stop the problem,
											all of Egypt&#39;s sites will be affected
by looting by 2040.
											Thus, we are at a tipping point.
											We are the generation with all the tools
and all the technologies
											to stop looting,

											Sometimes an archaeological site
can surprise you with its resilience.
											I am just back from the field,
											where I co-led a joint mission
with Egypt&#39;s Ministry of Antiquities
											at a site called Lisht.
											This site dates to the Middle Kingdom
of Egypt between 2,000 and 1,750 BC.
											The Middle Kingdom was Ancient
Egypt&#39;s Renaissance period.
											After a time of intense internal strife
and environmental challenges,
											Egypt rebounded
											with an incredible resurgence
of art, architecture and literature.
											It&#39;s a favorite period of time

of people buried there

at the court of Pharaoh.
											You can see this before and after;
you see dozens of looting pits.
											North Lisht.
											This is in South Lisht, before and after.
											When we first visited the site,
											we could see the tombs
of many high-ranking officials
											that had been looted.
											Let me put into perspective
for you what was taken.
											Imagine a two meter by two meter area
full of coffins, jewelry

											So, when we started work,
											my Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef,
approached me and said,
											&quot;We must work at this one particular tomb.
											It&#39;s been attacked by looters.
											If we don&#39;t do anything, they&#39;ll be back.&quot;
											Of course I agreed,
but I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d find anything.
											I thought the looters
had stolen everything.
											What we started to find
were the most incredible reliefs.
											Look at this painting —
it&#39;s just stunning.
											We started finding engraved inscriptions.
											And even the titles of the tomb owner —
											he had titles like,
&quot;Overseer of the Army,&quot;
											&quot;Overseer of the Treasury.&quot;
											I began to have hope.
											Maybe, just maybe we would find his name.
											For the ancient Egyptians, having
their name last for eternity
											was their goal.
											And then one day,
											this appeared.
											This is the name of the tomb owner: Intef.
											You can see it written out
here, in hieroglyphs.

											A hundred years ago,
archaeology was for the rich.
											Fifty years ago,
											it was for men.
											Now it&#39;s primarily for academics.
											Our goal is to democratize the process
of archaeological discovery,
											and allow anyone to participate.
											Ninety-four years ago,

the tomb of King Tut.

											By creating this platform,

											If we want to answer
the big questions about who we are
											and where we&#39;ve come from,
											the answers to those questions
do not lie in pyramids or palaces,
											but in the cities and villages
of those that came before us.
											If we want to learn about the past,
											it&#39;s time we inverted the pyramids.
											Acknowledging that the past
is worth saving
											means so much more.
											It means that we&#39;re worth saving, too.
											And the greatest story ever told

There's a lot to discover; in the Egyptian Delta alone, Parcak estimates we've excavated less than a thousandth of one percent of what's out there.

The winner of the 2016 TED Prize, her wish is to protect the world’s shared cultural heritage.","whylisten":"<p>There may be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of undiscovered ancient sites across the globe. Sarah Parcak wants to locate them. As a space archaeologist, she analyzes high-resolution imagery collected by satellites in order to identify subtle changes to the Earth&rsquo;s surface that might signal man-made features hidden from view. A TED Senior Fellow and a <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/sarah-parcak/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">National Geographic Explorer</a>, Parcak wrote the <a href=\"http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12033&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com/Satellite-Remote-Sensing-Archaeology-Parcak/dp/0415448786\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">textbook on satellite archaeology</a> and founded the Laboratory for Global Observation at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Her goal: to make the world&#39;s invisible history visible once again.</p><p>In Egypt, Parcak&#39;s techniques have helped locate 17 potential pyramids, and more than 3,100 potential forgotten settlements. She&#39;s also made discoveries in the Viking world (as seen in the PBS Nova special,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/vikings-unearthed.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">Vikings Unearthed</a>)</em>&nbsp;and across the Roman Empire (as shown in the BBC documentary,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pc063\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">Rome&rsquo;s Lost Empire</a>).</em>&nbsp;Her methods also offer a new way to understand how ancient sites are being affected by looting and urban development. By satellite-mapping Egypt and comparing sites over time, Parcak has noted a 1,000 percent increase in looting since 2009. It&rsquo;s likely that millions of dollars worth of artifacts are stolen each year. Parcak hopes that, through her work, unknown sites can be protected to preserve our rich, vibrant history.</p><p>As the winner of the 2016 TED Prize, Parcak asked the world to help in this important work. By building a citizen science platform for archaeology,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.globalxplorer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GlobalXplorer.org</a>, Parcak invites anyone with an internet connection to help find the next potential looting pit or unknown tomb. GlobalXplorer launched on January 30, 2017, with volunteers working together to map Peru. Other countries will follow, as the platform democratizes discovery and makes satellite-mapping rapid and cost-effective.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_parcak_help_discover_ancient_ruins_before_it_s_too_late","viewed_count":908351,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"Sarah Parcak recommends","blurb":"These five books open doors to our shared human history.

with thousands of black dots, evidence of excavations across Egypt where looters have tunneled in search of mummies, jewelry and other valuables prized by collectors, advertised in auction catalogs and trafficked on eBay, a criminal global black market estimated in the billions of dollars.","whotheyare":"Like a modern-day Indiana Jones, Sarah Parcak uses satellite images to locate lost ancient sites. The winner of the 2016 TED Prize, her wish is to protect the world’s shared cultural heritage.","whylisten":"<p>There may be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of undiscovered ancient sites across the globe. Sarah Parcak wants to locate them. As a space archaeologist, she analyzes high-resolution imagery collected by satellites in order to identify subtle changes to the Earth&rsquo;s surface that might signal man-made features hidden from view. A TED Senior Fellow and a <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/sarah-parcak/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">National Geographic Explorer</a>, Parcak wrote the <a href=\"http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12033&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com/Satellite-Remote-Sensing-Archaeology-Parcak/dp/0415448786\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">textbook on satellite archaeology</a> and founded the Laboratory for Global Observation at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Her goal: to make the world&#39;s invisible history visible once again.</p><p>In Egypt, Parcak&#39;s techniques have helped locate 17 potential pyramids, and more than 3,100 potential forgotten settlements. She&#39;s also made discoveries in the Viking world (as seen in the PBS Nova special,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/vikings-unearthed.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">Vikings Unearthed</a>)</em>&nbsp;and across the Roman Empire (as shown in the BBC documentary,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pc063\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">Rome&rsquo;s Lost Empire</a>).</em>&nbsp;Her methods also offer a new way to understand how ancient sites are being affected by looting and urban development. By satellite-mapping Egypt and comparing sites over time, Parcak has noted a 1,000 percent increase in looting since 2009. It&rsquo;s likely that millions of dollars worth of artifacts are stolen each year. Parcak hopes that, through her work, unknown sites can be protected to preserve our rich, vibrant history.</p><p>As the winner of the 2016 TED Prize, Parcak asked the world to help in this important work. By building a citizen science platform for archaeology,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.globalxplorer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GlobalXplorer.org</a>, Parcak invites anyone with an internet connection to help find the next potential looting pit or unknown tomb. GlobalXplorer launched on January 30, 2017, with volunteers working together to map Peru. Other countries will follow, as the platform democratizes discovery and makes satellite-mapping rapid and cost-effective.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Sarah Parcak","tags":["adventure","ancient world","archaeology","big problems","collaboration","communication","community","algorithm","Egypt","global issues","humanity","human origins","Middle East","potential","science","society","South America","technology","TED Prize","terrorism","violence","war","world cultures"],"title":"Help discover ancient ruins -- before it's too late","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":908351}]}
