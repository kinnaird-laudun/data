											I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most —

											I am very happy and honored to be amidst

											Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,

											We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,
											because another conference is taking place in Berlin.
											It is the G8 Summit.
											The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa&#39;s problems
											should be a massive increase in aid,
											something akin to the Marshall Plan.
											Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.
											One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.
											Its largest recipients were Germany and France,
											and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.
											An average African country receives foreign aid
											to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,
											and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources
											from rich countries to poor countries.

											But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.
											How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.
											By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,
											the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.
											However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.
											Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine,
											although they&#39;re part and parcel of our African reality,
											they are not the only reality.
											And secondly, they are the smallest reality.

											Africa has 53 nations.
											We have civil wars only in six countries,
											which means that the media are covering only six countries.
											Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate
											through the web of despair and helplessness
											that the Western media largely presents to its audience.
											But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.
											It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.
											And, as a consequence, the Western view
											of Africa&#39;s economic dilemma is framed wrongly.
											The wrong framing is a product of thinking
											that Africa is a place of despair.
											What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.
											We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.
											We should send peacekeeping troops
											to serve those who are facing a civil war.
											And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.

									<p>
											I want to say that it is important to recognize
											that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.
											But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.
											We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,
											from a challenge of despair,
											which is called poverty reduction,
											to a challenge of hope.
											We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.
											The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa
											is not the challenge of reducing poverty.
											It should be a challenge of creating wealth.

											Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,

											AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.
											External actors can only present to you an opportunity.
											The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage
											depends on your internal capacity.
											Africa has received many opportunities.
											Many of them we haven&#39;t benefited much.
											Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework
											and policy framework that can make it possible for us
											to benefit from our external relations. I&#39;ll give you an example.

											Under the Cotonou Agreement,
											formerly known as the Lome Convention,
											African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe
											to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.
											My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons
											of sugar to the European Union market.
											We haven&#39;t exported one kilogram yet.
											We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.
											Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,
											African countries that produce beef
											have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.
											None of those countries, including Africa&#39;s most successful nation, Botswana,
											has ever met its quota.

											So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa&#39;s
											inability to engage the rest of the world
											in a more productive relationship
											is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.
											And all forms of intervention need support,
											the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,
											the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.
											How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?
											Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?
											Because all governments across the world need money to survive.
											Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
											You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.
											And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,
											they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.
											The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.
											Why should people support their government?
											Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs,
											or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities
											to profit from corruption.

											The fact is no government in the world,
											with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,
											can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.
											Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.
											To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,
											primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.
											If the government&#39;s fiscal survival
											depends on it having to raise money from its own people,
											such a government is driven by self-interest
											to govern in a more enlightened fashion.
											It will sit with those who create wealth.
											Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions
											that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business
											so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.
											The problem with the African continent
											and the problem with the aid industry
											is that it has distorted the structure of incentives
											facing the governments in Africa.
											The productive margin in our governments&#39; search for revenue
											does not lie in the domestic economy,
											it lies with international donors.

											implementation process in our countries.
											We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.
											The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world

											But I want to put a caveat on my argument,

											Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.
											It may have built a road, and that road
											may have served a very good role.
											The mistake of the international aid industry

											ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,

											Aid increases the resources available to governments,
											and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing
											you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.
											By increasing the political attractiveness of the state,
											especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,
											aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions
											as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state
											in order to get access to the foreign aid pie.
											Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa
											cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector
											because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.
											Governments are not changing it. Why?
											Because they don&#39;t need to talk to their own citizens.
											They talk to international donors.
											So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,
											and that has increased the political tensions in our countries
											precisely because we depend on aid.

											I also want to say that it is important for us to
											note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid
											from the international community,
											in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,
											and all other forms of aid.
											Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,
											and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.
											Where has all the aid gone?

											I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,
											and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.
											In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.
											The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.
											Uganda&#39;s recurrent expenditure — by recurrent what do I mean?
											Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.
											Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent
											of its own revenue?
											It&#39;s because there&#39;s somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.
											But this shows you that the government of Uganda
											is not committed to spending its own revenue
											to invest in productive investments,
											but rather it devotes this revenue
											to paying structure of public expenditure.
											Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.
											The military, 380 billion.
											Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,
											takes only 18 billion.
											Trade and industry takes 43 billion.
											And let me show you, what does public expenditure —
											rather, public administration expenditure — in Uganda constitute?
											There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,
											by the way, who never see the president, except on television.

Too much of the aid from rich nations, he says, goes to the worst African countries to fuel war and government abuse. Such money not only never gets to its intended recipients, Africa&#39;s truly needy -- it actively plays a part in making their lives worse.<br /><br />Mwenda worked at the <a href=\"http://www.monitor.co.ug/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Daily Monitor</em></a>  newspaper in Kampala starting in the mid-1990s, and hosted a radio show, <em>Andrew Mwenda Live</em>, since 2001; in 2005, <strong>he was <a href=\"http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=14741\" target=\"_blank\">charged with sedition</a>  by the Ugandan government for criticizing the president of Uganda on his radio show</strong>, in the wake of the helicopter crash that killed the vice president of Sudan. He has produced documentaries and commentary for the BBC on the dangers of aid and debt relief to Africa, and consulted for the World Bank and Transparency international, and was a Knight Fellow at Stanford in 2007. </p><p>In December 2007, he launched a new newspaper in Kampala, <em>The Independent</em>, a leading source of uncensored news in the country. The following spring, he was arrested and accused of publishing inflammatory articles about the Ugandan government.
