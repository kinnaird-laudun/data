											I&#39;m an ecologist,
											mostly a coral reef ecologist.
											I started out in Chesapeake Bay
											and went diving in the winter
											and became a tropical ecologist overnight.
											And it was really a lot of fun
											for about 10 years.
											I mean, somebody pays you
											to go around and travel
											and look at some of the most
											beautiful places on the planet.
											And that was what I did.

											And I ended up in Jamaica,
											in the West Indies,
											where the coral reefs were really
											among the most extraordinary, structurally,
											that I ever saw in my life.
											And this picture here,
											it&#39;s really interesting, it shows two things:
											First of all, it&#39;s in black and white
											because the water was so clear
											and you could see so far,
											and film was so slow
											in the 1960s and early 70s,
											you took pictures in black and white.
											The other thing it shows you
											is that, although there&#39;s this beautiful
											forest of coral,
											there are no fish in that picture.

											Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica
											were the most studied coral reefs
											in the world for 20 years.
											We were the best and the brightest.
											People came to study our reefs from Australia,
											which is sort of funny
											because now we go to theirs.
											And the view of scientists
											about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,
											was based on these reefs
											without any fish.
											Then, in 1980,
											there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.
											I put half the lab
											up in my house.
											The wind blew very strong.
											The waves were 25
											to 50 feet high.
											And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,
											and we thought, &quot;Well, we&#39;re real smart.
											We know that hurricanes
											have always happened in the past.&quot;
											And we published a paper in Science,
											the first time that anybody ever
											described the destruction
											on a coral reef by a major hurricane.
											And we predicted what would happen,
											and we got it all wrong.
											And the reason was
											because of overfishing,
											and the fact that a last common grazer,
											a sea urchin, died.
											And within a few months
											after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.
											And that is the same reef;
											that&#39;s the same reef 15 years ago;
											that&#39;s the same reef today.
											The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica
											have a few percent live coral cover
											and a lot of seaweed and slime.
											And that&#39;s more or less the story
											of the coral reefs of the Caribbean,
											and increasingly, tragically,
											the coral reefs worldwide.

											Now, that&#39;s my little, depressing story.
											All of us in our 60s and 70s
											have comparable depressing stories.
											There are tens of thousands
											of those stories out there,
											and it&#39;s really hard to conjure up
											much of a sense of well-being,
											because it just keeps getting worse.
											And the reason it keeps getting worse
											is that after a natural catastrophe,
											like a hurricane,
											it used to be that there was
											some kind of successional sequence of recovery,
											but what&#39;s going on now is that
											overfishing and pollution and climate change
											are all interacting
											in a way that prevents that.
											And so I&#39;m going to sort of go through
											and talk about those three
											kinds of things.

											We hear a lot about
											the collapse of cod.
											It&#39;s difficult to imagine that
											two, or some historians would say three world wars
											were fought during the colonial era
											for the control of cod.
											Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.
											It fed the slaves
											brought to the Antilles,
											the song &quot;Jamaica Farewell&quot; —
											&quot;Ackee rice salt fish are nice&quot; —
											is an emblem of the importance
											of salt cod from northeastern Canada.
											It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:
											35,000 people lost their jobs.
											And that was the beginning
											of a kind of serial depletion
											from bigger and tastier species
											to smaller and not-so-tasty species,
											from species that were near to home
											to species that were all around the world,
											and what have you.
											It&#39;s a little hard to understand that,
											because you can go to a Costco in the United States
											and buy cheap fish.
											You ought to read the label to find out where it came from,
											but it&#39;s still cheap,
											and everybody thinks it&#39;s okay.

											It&#39;s hard to communicate this,
											and one way that I think is really interesting
											is to talk about sport fish,
											because people like to go out and catch fish.
											It&#39;s one of those things.
											This picture here shows the trophy fish,
											the biggest fish caught
											by people who pay a lot of money
											to get on a boat,
											go to a place off of Key West in Florida,
											drink a lot of beer,
											throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water,
											come back with the biggest and the best fish,
											and the champion trophy fish
											are put on this board, where people take a picture,
											and this guy is obviously
											really excited about that fish.
											Well, that&#39;s what it&#39;s like now,
											but this is what it was like in the 1950s
											from the same boat in the same place
											on the same board on the same dock.
											The trophy fish
											were so big
											that you couldn&#39;t put any of those small fish up on it.
											And the average size trophy fish
											weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,
											and if you wanted to go out and kill something,
											you could pretty much count on
											being able to catch one of those fish.
											And they tasted really good.
											And people paid less in 1950 dollars
											to catch that
											than what people pay now
											to catch those little, tiny fish.
											And that&#39;s everywhere.

											It&#39;s not just the fish, though,
											that are disappearing.
											Industrial fishing uses big stuff,
											big machinery.
											We use nets that are 20 miles long.
											We use longlines
											that have one million or two million hooks.
											And we trawl,
											which means to take something
											the size of a tractor trailer truck
											that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,
											put it on a big chain,
											and drag it across the sea floor
											to stir up the bottom and catch the fish.
											Think of it as
											being kind of the bulldozing of a city
											or of a forest,
											because it clears it away.
											And the habitat destruction
											is unbelievable.
											This is a photograph,
											a typical photograph,
											of what the continental shelves
											of the world look like.
											You can see the rows in the bottom,
											the way you can see the rows
											in a field that has just been plowed
											to plant corn.
											What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,
											which is a critical habitat
											for the development of fish.
											What it is now is mud,
											and the area of the ocean floor
											that has been transformed from forest
											to level mud, to parking lot,
											is equivalent to the entire area
											of all the forests
											that have ever been cut down
											on all of the earth
											in the history of humanity.
											We&#39;ve managed to do that
											in the last 100 to 150 years.

											We tend to think of oil spills
											and mercury
											and we hear a lot about plastic these days.
											And all of that stuff is really disgusting,
											but what&#39;s really insidious
											is the biological pollution that happens
											because of the magnitude of the shifts
											that it causes
											to entire ecosystems.
											And I&#39;m going to just talk very briefly
											about two kinds of biological pollution:
											one is introduced species
											and the other is what comes from nutrients.
											So this is the infamous
											Caulerpa taxifolia,
											the so-called killer algae.
											A book was written about it.
											It&#39;s a bit of an embarrassment.
											It was accidentally released
											from the aquarium in Monaco,
											it was bred to be cold tolerant
											to have in peoples aquaria.
											It&#39;s very pretty,
											and it has rapidly started
											to overgrow
											the once very rich
											biodiversity of the
											northwestern Mediterranean.
											I don&#39;t know how many of you remember the movie
											&quot;The Little Shop of Horrors,&quot;
											but this is the plant of &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors.&quot;
											But, instead of devouring the people in the shop,
											what it&#39;s doing is overgrowing
											and smothering
											virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life
											of the entire northwestern
											Mediterranean Sea.
											We don&#39;t know anything that eats it,
											we&#39;re trying to do all sorts of genetics
											and figure out something that could be done,
											but, as it stands, it&#39;s the monster from hell,
											about which nobody knows what to do.

									<p>
											Now another form of pollution
											that&#39;s biological pollution
											is what happens from excess nutrients.
											The green revolution,
											all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.
											It&#39;s subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.
											It runs down the rivers,
											and it feeds the plankton,
											the little microscopic plant cells
											in the coastal water.
											But since we ate all the oysters
											and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,
											there&#39;s nothing to eat the plankton
											and there&#39;s more and more of it,
											so it dies of old age,
											which is unheard of for plankton.
											And when it dies, it falls to the bottom
											and then it rots,
											which means that bacteria break it down.
											And in the process
											they use up all the oxygen,
											and in using up all the oxygen
											they make the environment utterly lethal
											for anything that can&#39;t swim away.
											So, what we end up with
											is a microbial zoo
											dominated by bacteria
											and jellyfish, as you see
											on the left in front of you.
											And the only fishery left —
											and it is a commercial fishery —
											is the jellyfish fishery
											you see on the right, where there used to be prawns.
											Even in Newfoundland
											where we used to catch cod,
											we now have a jellyfish fishery.

									<p>
											And another version of this sort of thing
											is what is often called red tides
											or toxic blooms.
											That picture on the left is just staggering to me.
											I have talked about it a million times,
											but it&#39;s unbelievable.
											In the upper right of that picture on the left
											is almost the Mississippi Delta,
											and the lower left of that picture
											is the Texas-Mexico border.
											You&#39;re looking at the entire
											northwestern Gulf of Mexico;
											you&#39;re looking at one toxic
											dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,
											made by that beautiful little creature
											on the lower right.
											And in the upper right you see this
											black sort of cloud
											moving ashore.
											That&#39;s the same species.
											And as it comes to shore and the wind blows,
											and little droplets of the water get into the air,
											the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up
											with people with acute respiratory distress.
											And that&#39;s retirement homes
											on the west coast of Florida.
											A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood
											we called Hollywood ocean night,
											and I was trying to figure out how to
											explain to actors what&#39;s going on.
											And I said,
											&quot;So, imagine you&#39;re in a movie called &#39;Escape from Malibu&#39;
											because all the beautiful people have moved
											to North Dakota, where it&#39;s clean and safe.
											And the only people who are left there
											are the people who can&#39;t afford
											to move away from the coast,
											because the coast, instead of being paradise,
											is harmful to your health.&quot;

											And then this is amazing.
											It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.
											This is from the coast of Brittany,
											which is being enveloped
											in this green, algal slime.
											The reason that it attracted so much attention,
											besides the fact that it&#39;s disgusting,
											is that sea birds flying over it
											are asphyxiated by the smell and die,
											and a farmer died of it,
											and you can imagine the scandal that happened.
											And so there&#39;s this war
											between the farmers
											and the fishermen about it all,
											and the net result is that
											the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff
											on a regular basis.

									<p>
											And then, of course, there&#39;s climate change,
											and we all know about climate change.
											I guess the iconic figure of it
											is the melting of the ice
											in the Arctic Sea.
											Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died
											trying to find the Northwest Passage.
											Well, the Northwest Passage is already there.
											I think it&#39;s sort of funny;
											it&#39;s on the Siberian coast,
											maybe the Russians will charge tolls.
											The governments of the world
											are taking this really seriously.
											The military of the Arctic nations
											is taking it really seriously.
											For all the denial of climate change
											by government leaders,
											the CIA
											and the navies of Norway
											and the U.S. and Canada, whatever
											are busily thinking about
											how they will secure their territory
											in this inevitability
											from their point of view.
											And, of course, Arctic communities are toast.

									<p>
											The other kinds of effects of climate change —
											this is coral bleaching. It&#39;s a beautiful picture, right?
											All that white coral.
											Except it&#39;s supposed to be brown.
											What happens is that
											the corals are a symbiosis,
											and they have these little algal cells
											that live inside them.
											And the algae give the corals sugar,
											and the corals give the algae
											nutrients and protection.
											But when it gets too hot,
											the algae can&#39;t make the sugar.
											The corals say, &quot;You cheated. You didn&#39;t pay your rent.&quot;
											They kick them out, and then they die.
											Not all of them die; some of them survive,
											some more are surviving,
											but it&#39;s really bad news.
											To try and give you a sense of this,
											imagine you go camping in July
											somewhere in Europe or in North America,
											and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,
											and you see that 80 percent of the trees,
											as far as you can see,
											have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.
											And you come home, and you discover
											that 80 percent of all the trees
											in North America and in Europe
											have dropped their leaves.
											And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,
											&quot;Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died.&quot;
											Well, that&#39;s what happened in the Indian Ocean
											during the 1998 El Nino,
											an area vastly greater
											than the size of North America and Europe,
											when 80 percent of all the corals bleached
											and a quarter of them died.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then the really scary thing
											about all of this —
											the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change —
											is that each thing doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum.
											But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,
											the synergies among them
											that make the whole vastly greater
											than the sum of the parts.
											And the great scientific challenge
											for people like me in thinking about all this,
											is do we know how
											to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?
											I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.
											But what does that mean?
											We really don&#39;t know.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what are the oceans going to be like
											in 20 or 50 years?
											Well, there won&#39;t be any fish
											except for minnows,
											and the water will be pretty dirty,
											and all those kinds of things
											and full of mercury, etc., etc.
											And dead zones will get bigger and bigger
											and they&#39;ll start to merge,
											and we can imagine something like
											the dead-zonification
											of the global, coastal ocean.
											Then you sure won&#39;t want to eat fish that were raised in it,
											because it would be a kind of
											gastronomic Russian roulette.
											Sometimes you have a toxic bloom;
											sometimes you don&#39;t.
											That doesn&#39;t sell.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The really scary things though
											are the physical, chemical,
											oceanographic things that are happening.
											As the surface of the ocean gets warmer,
											the water is lighter when it&#39;s warmer,
											it becomes harder and harder
											to turn the ocean over.
											We say it becomes
											more strongly stratified.
											The consequence of that is that
											all those nutrients
											that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,
											of the sardines of California
											or in Peru or whatever,
											those slow down
											and those fisheries collapse.
											And, at the same time,
											water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,
											doesn&#39;t make it down
											and the ocean turns into a desert.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the question is: How are we all
											going to respond to this?
											And we can do
											all sorts of things to fix it,
											but in the final analysis,
											the thing we really need to fix
											is ourselves.
											It&#39;s not about the fish; it&#39;s not about the pollution;
											it&#39;s not about the climate change.
											It&#39;s about us
											and our greed and our need for growth
											and our inability to imagine a world
											that is different from the selfish world
											we live in today.
											So the question is: Will we respond to this or not?
											I would say that the future of life
											and the dignity of human beings
											depends on our doing that.
