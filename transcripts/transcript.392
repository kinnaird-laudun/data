											The &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; crew and I were called

in Colorado, called Craig.

who haven&#39;t seen it — it&#39;s pretty simple.

											And my responsibilities
are to simply try and keep up,

an absolute part of this work.
											Normally, I never do any research at all.
											But this is a touchy subject,
and I work for the Discovery Channel,

whatever it is we do.
											And we certainly want to do it
with a lot of respect for the animals.

											I can give you 30 examples right now.
											Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas
											who collects the uneaten scraps
of food from the casinos
											and feeds them to his swine.
											Why?
											Because there&#39;s so much protein
in the stuff we don&#39;t eat,
											his pigs grow at twice the normal speed,
and he&#39;s one rich pig farmer.
											He&#39;s good for the environment,
											he spends his days
doing this incredible service,
											and he smells like hell,
but God bless him.
											He&#39;s making a great living.
											You ask him, &quot;Did you follow
your passion here?&quot;
											and he&#39;d laugh at you.
											The guy&#39;s worth — he just got offered
like 60 million dollars for his farm
											and turned it down, outside of Vegas.
											He didn&#39;t follow his passion.
											He stepped back and he watched
where everybody was going,
											and he went the other way.
											And I hear that story over and over.

											Barack wants to create
two and a half million jobs.
											The infrastructure is a huge deal.
											This war on work that I suppose exists,
has casualties like any other war.
											The infrastructure is the first one,
											declining trade school enrollments
are the second one.
											Every single year, fewer electricians,
fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,
											fewer welders, fewer pipe fitters,
fewer steam fitters.
											The infrastructure jobs that everybody
is talking about creating
											are those guys — the ones
that have been in decline, over and over.
											Meanwhile, we&#39;ve got
two trillion dollars, at a minimum,
