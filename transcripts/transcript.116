											First place I&#39;d like to take you
											is what many believe will be the world&#39;s deepest natural abyss.
											And I say believe because this process is still ongoing.
											Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year
											that I&#39;ll talk a little bit about.

											One of the things that&#39;s changed here,
											in the last 150 years since Jules Verne
											had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,
											is that technology has enabled us to go to these places
											that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.
											We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.
											Along the way we&#39;ve discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large
											that you can see for hundreds of meters
											without a break in the line of sight.
											When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field
											for anywhere from two to four months,
											with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.

											And a lot of people ask me, you know,
											what kind of people do you get for a project like this?
											While our selection process
											is not as rigorous as NASA, it&#39;s nonetheless thorough.
											We&#39;re looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.
											In case you&#39;re wondering, this is our strength test.
											(Laughter)
											But we also value esprit de corps
											and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict
											while under great stress in remote locations.

											We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.
											From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.
											You&#39;re looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.
											We&#39;re roughly two days from the entrance at that point.
											And it&#39;s kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse,
											except that you&#39;re now running a string of these things down.
											The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort
											while you&#39;re down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.
											I should mention that everything you&#39;re seeing here, by the way,
											is artificially illuminated at great effort.
											Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.

											The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.
											It&#39;s basically like a tree collecting water coming down.
											And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous
											and unfortunately slides just don&#39;t do justice.
											So I&#39;ve got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.
											So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.
											(Video)
											Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here
											are obsolete and dangerous.
											We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.

											Along that same line, I have to tell you
											that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,
											we have never seen monsters underground —
											at least the kind that eat you.
											If there is a monster underground,
											it is the crushing psychological remoteness
											that begins to hit every member of the team
											once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.

											Next year I&#39;ll be leading an international team to J2.
											We&#39;re going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters —
											that&#39;s a little over 8,600 feet down —
											at 30 kilometers from the entrance.
											The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.

											Eventually, if you keep going down in these things,
											probability says that you&#39;re going to run into a place like this.
											It&#39;s a place where there&#39;s a fold in the geologic stratum
											that collects water and fills to the roof.
											And when you used to find these things,
											they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.
											Now I remember that term really well for two reasons.
											Number one, it&#39;s the name of my rock band, and second,
											is because the confrontation of these things
											forced me to become an inventor.
											And we&#39;ve since gone on to develop
											many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.

											Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment

											It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.
											This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,

											There are two primary targets we&#39;re doing here.
											One is, how do you do science autonomy underground?
											How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?
											There are more stages involved here
											than I&#39;ve got time to tell you about, but basically we drive
											through the space, we populate it with environmental variables —
											sulphide, halide, things like that.
											We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall
											where there&#39;s a high probability of life.
											We move along the wall, in what&#39;s called proximity operations,
											looking for changes in color.
											If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.
											If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.
											We either draw in a liquid sample,
											or we can actually take a solid core from the wall.
											No hands at the wheel.
											This is all behavioral autonomy here
											that&#39;s being conducted by the robot on its own.

											The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.
											Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.
											The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:
											a gas station on orbit.
											It&#39;s not going to look like that.
											If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, to give you a chance to understand
											why there is power in that statement,
											I&#39;ve got to give you the basics of Space 101.
											And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.
											Anybody drink one of these here this week?
											You&#39;d pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.
											That&#39;s more than you pay for TED,
											if Google dropped their sponsorship.
											(Laughter)
											The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.
											Thus, every time you&#39;d want to do anything in space,
											you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money
											every time you hit the accelerator.
											Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.

									<p>
											So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?
											There is a place where you can.
											In fact, you can get it better — you can get it at 14 times lower
											if you can find propellant on the moon.
											There is a little-known mission that was launched
											by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.
											And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission
											was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater
											on the south pole of the moon.
											That signal was so strong,
											it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water
											buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years
											by the impact of asteroids and comet material.

									<p>
											If we&#39;re going to get that, and make that gas station possible,
											we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.
											We can&#39;t do that right now.
											The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack
											that has to be launched from the ground,
											and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.
											We have to beat that.
											We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.
											We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.
											This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,
											with Dr. Lowell Wood&#39;s group.
											And we can extend that now to just about everything.
											Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.
											We can go much further.
											We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.
											There&#39;s another thing.
											When you&#39;re coming back from the moon,
											you have to deal with orbital mechanics.
											It says you&#39;re moving 10,000 feet per second faster
											than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.

											You got two choices.
											You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.
											You can dive into the stratosphere,
											and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.
											It has never been done.
											It&#39;s risky and it&#39;s going to be one hell of a ride —
											better than Disney.
											The traditional approach to space exploration
											has been that you carry all the fuel you need
											to get everybody back in case of an emergency.
											If you try to do that for the moon,
											you&#39;re going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.
											But if you send a mining team there,
											without the return propellant, first —
											(Laughter)
											Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?
											This is not like that. I&#39;m much more like Scotty.
											I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it
											so we&#39;re not going to burn the gear.
											But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,
											and it would be the most dramatic demonstration
											that you could do something worthwhile off this planet
											that has ever been done.
											There&#39;s a myth that you can&#39;t do anything in space
											for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.
											That&#39;s not true.
											In seven years, we could pull off
											an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate
											that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.

											We&#39;re living in one of the most exciting times in history.

											The orbital refueling stations I&#39;ve just described
											could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key
											for opening space to the general exploration.
											To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.
											We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial
											Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,
											to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate
											they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.

In 2009, Stone and his team completed a successful mission to Antarctica. ENDURANCE, an expedition sponsored by NASA, was developed to explore and map under the ice of Lake Bonney in Antarctica. But this was just a test for the real mission (which is explained in a&nbsp; National Geographic documentary,&nbsp;<em>Journey to an Alien Moon</em>):&nbsp;building a probe with NASA to bore through miles of ice on Jupiter&#39;s moon Europa, then swim through the buried Europan sea in search of alien life.<br /><br />He&#39;s also hoping to singlehandedly jump-start commercial human space exploration by offering spacefarers affordable fuels and consumables extracted from the moon.
