											We would read some text in feminist theory
and have a conversation about it.
											And during one of our conversations,
											I witnessed an interaction
that changed my life forever.
											It was a conversation between two women.
											One of the women was white,
and one was black.
											And the white woman said —
											this is going to sound
very anachronistic now —
											the white woman said, &quot;All women
face the same oppression as women.
											All women are similarly
situated in patriarchy,
											and therefore all women have a kind
of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood.&quot;
											And the black woman said,
&quot;I&#39;m not so sure.
											Let me ask you a question.&quot;
											So the black woman
says to the white woman,
											&quot;When you wake up in the morning
and you look in the mirror,
											what do you see?&quot;
											And the white woman said, &quot;I see a woman.&quot;
											And the black woman said,
&quot;You see, that&#39;s the problem for me.
											Because when I wake up in the morning
and I look in the mirror,&quot; she said,

											To me, race is visible. But to you,
race is invisible. You don&#39;t see it.&quot;
											And then she said
something really startling.
											She said, &quot;That&#39;s how privilege works.
											Privilege is invisible
to those who have it.&quot;
											It is a luxury, I will say
to the white people sitting in this room,
											not to have to think about race
every split second of our lives.
											Privilege is invisible
to those who have it.

											There&#39;s another group, though,
that actively resists gender equality,
											that sees gender equality
as something that is detrimental to men.
											I was on a TV talk show
opposite four white men.
											This is the beginning of the book
I wrote, &#39;Angry White Men.&#39;
											These were four angry white men
											who believed that they,
white men in America,
											were the victims of reverse discrimination
in the workplace.
											And they all told stories
about how they were qualified for jobs,
											qualified for promotions,
											they didn&#39;t get them,
they were really angry.
											And the reason I&#39;m telling you this
is I want you to hear the title
											of this particular show.
											It was a quote from one of the men,
											and the quote was,
											&quot;A Black Woman Stole My Job.&quot;
											And they all told their stories,
											qualified for jobs,
qualified for promotions,
											didn&#39;t get it, really angry.
											And then it was my turn to speak,
											and I said, &quot;I have
just one question for you guys,
											and it&#39;s about the title of the show,
											&#39;A Black Woman Stole My Job.&#39;
											Actually, it&#39;s about
one word in the title.
											I want to know about the word &#39;my.&#39;
											Where did you get the idea
it was your job?
											Why isn&#39;t the title of the show,
&#39;A Black Woman Got the Job?&#39;
											or &#39;A Black Woman Got A Job?&#39;&quot;
											Because without confronting
men&#39;s sense of entitlement,
											I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever understand
why so many men resist gender equality.

											Their wives are less likely
to see a therapist,
											less likely to be diagnosed
with depression,
											less likely to be put on medication,
more likely to go to the gym,
											report higher levels
of marital satisfaction.
											So when men share housework and childcare,
											their wives are happier and healthier,
											and men certainly want this as well.
											When men share housework and childcare,
											the men are healthier.
											They smoke less, drink less,
take recreational drugs less often.
											They are less likely to go to the ER
											but more like to go to a doctor
for routine screenings.
											They are less likely to see a therapist,
											less likely to be diagnosed
with depression,
											less likely to be taking
prescription medication.
											So when men share housework and childcare,
											the men are happier and healthier.
											And who wouldn&#39;t want that?

											Now, I will say,

											these data were collected
over a really long period of time,

											&quot;Hmm, OK, I think
I&#39;ll do the dishes tonight.&quot;
											These data were collected

put it on their cover,

											So, what we found
is something really important,
											that gender equality
											is in the interest of countries,
											of companies, and of men,
											and their children and their partners,
											that gender equality
is not a zero-sum game.
											It&#39;s not a win-lose.
											It is a win-win for everyone.
											And what we also know
											is we cannot fully empower women and girls
											unless we engage boys and men.
											We know this.
											And my position is
											that men need the very things
that women have identified
											that they need to live the lives
they say they want to live
											in order to live the lives
that we say we want to live.

											In 1915, on the eve of one
of the great suffrage demonstrations
											down Fifth Avenue in New York City,
											a writer in New York
wrote an article in a magazine,

											&quot;Feminism for Men.&quot;
