											It is interesting that in the United States,
											the most significant health-care budget
											goes to cardiovascular disease care, whether it&#39;s private or public.
											There&#39;s no comparison at all.
											In Africa — where it is a major killer — it is totally ignored.

											And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it.
											A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.
											17 million people die every year from heart disease.
											32 million heart attacks and strokes occur.
											Most of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa.
											85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease
											is in developing countries — not in the West —
											and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.

											It&#39;s not just the Africans that should be concerned about that.
											All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time,
											should be very concerned about this deplorable situation.
											Has anyone here wondered what will happen
											if you go back to your room at night,
											and you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating?
											You&#39;re having a heart attack. What are you going to do?
											Will you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe?

											This is what&#39;s going on.
											In a look at the map of the U.S. — the graph here,
											10 million people here, 10 million here.
											By the time you get to 50, it&#39;s almost no one left in Nigeria —
											life expectancy is 47.
											It&#39;s not because some people don&#39;t survive childhood illnesses —
											they do — but they do not survive after the time that they reach
											about 45 years old and 50 years old.
											And those are the times they&#39;re most productive.
											Those are the times that they should be contributing
											to Africa&#39;s development. But they&#39;re not there.
											The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents.
											If you cannot secure the parents,
											you cannot guarantee the security of the African child.

											What are the risk factors?
											It&#39;s very well known. I&#39;m not going to spend a lot of time on those.
											These are just for information:
											hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects.
											Right here in Tanzania, 30 percent of individuals have hypertension.
											20 percent are getting treated.
											Only less than one percent are adequately treated.
											If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa,
											we&#39;ll save 250,000 lives a year. That&#39;s quite significant!

											Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius.
											In eight short years — we&#39;re here talking about HIV, malaria,
											which is all good.
											We cannot make the mistakes we&#39;ve made with malaria and HIV.

											That is something to keep in mind. We can&#39;t deal with it with situations like this.
											This is a typical African hospital. We can&#39;t depend on the elites —
											they go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable.
											You can&#39;t depend on foreign aid alone.
											Here is the situation: countries are turning inwards.
											Post-9/11, [the] United States has had a lot of trouble
											to deal with, their own internal issues.
											So, they spend their money trying to fix those problems.
											You can&#39;t rightly — it&#39;s not their responsibility,
											it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems.
											If they help, that&#39;s good! But that is not my expectation.
											These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa
											demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things
											the way we&#39;ve always done them.
											If they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions.

											I&#39;m here to talk to you about solutions.
											This has been — what has been a difficult sign to some of us.
											Several years ago, we started thinking about it.
											Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.
											We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.
											Everyone is ready to throw in money,
											in terms of free money aid to developing countries.
											Talk about sustainable investment, no one is interested.
											You can&#39;t raise money.
											I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States —
											I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.
											[It&#39;s] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures.
											But start telling them, you know,
											we&#39;re going to try to do it in Nigeria — everyone runs away.
											That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here,
											if you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development.

											Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute,
											so you get a glimpse of what we do,
											and I&#39;ll talk a little bit more about it.
											What we have done is to show that high-quality health care,
											comparable to the best anywhere in the world,
											can be done in a developing country environment.
											We have 25 positions right now — all of them trained,
											board certified in the USA, Canada or Britain.
											We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt,
											Cleveland Clinic — everywhere in the U.S. —
											and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost
											that you will need to do those things in the United States.

											This is the way our centers are set up.
											We currently have three locations in the Caribbean,
											and we&#39;re planning a fourth one.
											And we have now decided to go into Africa.
											We will be doing the West African Heart Institute

											And we will do other centers.
											This model can be adapted to every disease process.
											All the units, all the centers, are linked
											through a switched hub to a central server,
											and all the images are populated to review stations.
											And we designed this telemedicine solution. It&#39;s proprietary to us,

											They&#39;ll give me that information,

											But you know, they have that luxury.
											Because if you can&#39;t get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham,
											two hours away, and you&#39;ll get it. If you can&#39;t get it in Cleveland,
											you can go to Cincinnati. We don&#39;t have that luxury,

											When we do it, we will put the cost of care down.

											It cannot just be technology, we recognize that.
											Prevention must be part of the solution — we emphasize that.
											But, you know, you have to tell people what can be done.
											It&#39;s not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive,
											and they go home and can&#39;t do it.
											They need to be alive, they need to feed.
											We recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do.
											We have had walks every year — every March, April.
											We form people into groups and make them go into challenges.
											Which group loses the most weight, we give them prizes.
											Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer,
											we give them prizes. We do this constantly.
											We encourage them to bring children.

											they will stay with it. In doing this we have created
											at least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone,
											and these are physicians with expertise and special training.
											We have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died,
											including four free pacemakers in patients
											with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology,
											complete heart block means certain death.
											If you don&#39;t get this pacemaker, you will be dead.

											Indirectly, we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars
											from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care.
											And we&#39;ve hopefully saved a lot of lives.
											By the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars
											in indigent care. In the first four months, it&#39;s been 340,000 dollars,
											averaging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that,
											because they have competing needs.
											They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it.
											People say, &quot;How can you do that?&quot; This is how we can do that.
											At least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment
											have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami
											because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean.
											And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more —
											eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home,
											getting the same quality of care.
											And for that money — for every one patient that has the money to pay,
											it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people
											that do not have the resources to pay.

											For this to work, this progress must be sustainable.
											So, we emphasize training. Training is critical.
											We have gone further: we have formed a relationship
											with the University of Technology, Jamaica,
											where I now have an appointment.
											And we are starting a biomedical engineering program,
											so that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment.
											That way we&#39;re not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues.
											We&#39;re also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs —
											training people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound,
											those kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training,
											it gives people motivation.
											Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging
											and all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear
											from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them.
