											Hi. So, this chap here,
											he thinks he can tell you the future.
											His name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have
											made him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter)
									</p>

											And like most of you, I suspect, I don&#39;t really believe
											that people can see into the future.
											I don&#39;t believe in precognition, and every now and then,
											you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future,
											and that&#39;s probably because it was a fluke, and we only
											hear about the flukes and about the freaks.
											We don&#39;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong.
											Now we expect that to happen with silly stories
											about precognition, but the problem is,
											we have exactly the same problem in academia
											and in medicine, and in this environment, it costs lives.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out,
											just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted
											a piece of research where he found evidence
											of precognitive powers in undergraduate students,
											and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal
											and most of the people who read this just said, &quot;Okay, well,
											fair enough, but I think that&#39;s a fluke, that&#39;s a freak, because I know
											that if I did a study where I found no evidence
											that undergraduate students had precognitive powers,
											it probably wouldn&#39;t get published in a journal.
											And in fact, we know that that&#39;s true, because
											several different groups of research scientists tried
											to replicate the findings of this precognition study,
											and when they submitted it to the exact same journal,
											the journal said, &quot;No, we&#39;re not interested in publishing
											replication. We&#39;re not interested in your negative data.&quot;
											So this is already evidence of how, in the academic
											literature, we will see a biased sample of the true picture
											of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted.
									</p>

									<p>
											But it doesn&#39;t just happen in the dry academic field of psychology.
											It also happens in, for example, cancer research.
											So in March, 2012, just one month ago, some researchers
											reported in the journal Nature how they had tried
											to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at
											potential treatment targets in cancer,
											and out of those 53 studies, they were only able
											to successfully replicate six.
											Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable.
											And they say in their discussion that this is very likely

											People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies,

											their first recommendation of how to fix this problem
											is to make it easier to publish negative results in science,

											encouraged to post more of their negative results in public.

											But it doesn&#39;t just happen in the very dry world
											of preclinical basic science cancer research.
											It also happens in the very real, flesh and blood
											of academic medicine. So in 1980,
											some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide,
											and this was an anti-arrhythmic drug,
											a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms,
											and the idea was, after people have had a heart attack,
											they&#39;re quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms,
											so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart
											rhythms, this will increase the chances of them surviving.
											Early on its development, they did a very small trial,
											just under a hundred patients.
											Fifty patients got lorcainide, and of those patients, 10 died.
											Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill
											with no active ingredient, and only one of them died.
											So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure,
											and its commercial development was stopped, and because
											its commercial development was stopped, this trial was never published.

									<p>
											Unfortunately, over the course of the next five, 10 years,
											other companies had the same idea about drugs that would
											prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks.
											These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed
											very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing,
											and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs
											also caused an increased rate of death
											that before we detected that safety signal,
											over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America
											from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs.

											Now actually, in 1993,
											the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study,
											published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community,
											in which they said, &quot;When we carried out our study in 1980,
											we thought that the increased death rate that occurred
											in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance.&quot;
											The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons,
											and this study was never published;
											it&#39;s now a good example of publication bias.
											That&#39;s the technical term for the phenomenon where
											unflattering data gets lost, gets unpublished, is left

											&quot;might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.&quot;

											Now these are stories from basic science.
											These are stories from 20, 30 years ago.
											The academic publishing environment is very different now.
											There are academic journals like &quot;Trials,&quot; the open access journal,
											which will publish any trial conducted in humans
											regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.
											But this problem of negative results that go missing in action
											is still very prevalent. In fact it&#39;s so prevalent
											that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine.
											So this is a drug called reboxetine, and this is a drug
											that I myself have prescribed. It&#39;s an antidepressant.
											And I&#39;m a very nerdy doctor, so I read all of the studies
											that I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published
											that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo,
											and I read the other three studies that were published
											that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant,
											and because this patient hadn&#39;t done well on those other antidepressants,
											I thought, well, reboxetine is just as good. It&#39;s one to try.
											But it turned out that I was misled. In fact,
											seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine
											against a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them
											was positive and that was published, but six of them
											were negative and they were left unpublished.
											Three trials were published comparing reboxetine
											against other antidepressants in which reboxetine
											was just as good, and they were published,
											but three times as many patients&#39; worth of data was collected
											which showed that reboxetine was worse than
											those other treatments, and those trials were not published.
											I felt misled.

											Now you might say, well, that&#39;s an extremely unusual example,
											and I wouldn&#39;t want to be guilty of the same kind of
											cherry-picking and selective referencing
											that I&#39;m accusing other people of.
											But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias
											has actually been very, very well studied.
											So here is one example of how you approach it.
											The classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where
											you know that they&#39;ve been conducted and completed,
											and then you go and see if they&#39;ve been published anywhere
											in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials
											that had ever been conducted on antidepressants
											that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA.
											They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package.
											So that&#39;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs,
											because we can never know if we have those,
											but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization.
											And then they went to see if these trials had been published
											in the peer-reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found.
											It was pretty much a 50-50 split. Half of these trials
											were positive, half of them were negative, in reality.
											But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature,
											what they found was a very different picture.
											Only three of the negative trials were published,
											but all but one of the positive trials were published.
											Now if we just flick back and forth between those two,
											you can see what a staggering difference there was
											between reality and what doctors, patients,
											commissioners of health services, and academics
											were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature.
											We were misled, and this is a systematic flaw
											in the core of medicine.

											In fact, there have been so many studies conducted on
											publication bias now, over a hundred, that they&#39;ve been
											collected in a systematic review, published in 2010,
											that took every single study on publication bias
											that they could find.
											Publication bias affects every field of medicine.
											About half of all trials, on average, go missing in action,
											and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely
											to be published as negative findings.

											This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine.
											If I flipped a coin 100 times but then
											withheld the results from you from half of those tosses,
											I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads.
											But that wouldn&#39;t mean that I had a two-headed coin.
											That would mean that I was a chancer
											and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it. (Laughter)
											But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate
											in the whole of evidence-based medicine.
											And to me, this is research misconduct.
											If I conducted one study and I withheld
											half of the data points from that one study,
											you would rightly accuse me, essentially, of research fraud.
											And yet, for some reason, if somebody conducts
											10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want,
											we don&#39;t consider that to be research misconduct.
											And when that responsibility is diffused between
											a whole network of researchers, academics,
											industry sponsors, journal editors, for some reason
											we find it more acceptable,
											but the effect on patients is damning.

											And this is happening right now, today.
											This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug
											which governments around the world have spent billions
											and billions of dollars on stockpiling,
											and we&#39;ve stockpiled Tamiflu in panic,
											in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza.
											Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia
											and death. (Laughter)
											Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers
											were trying to collect together all of the data from all
											of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not,
											they found that several of those trials were unpublished.
											The results were unavailable to them.
											And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means,
											through Freedom of Information Act requests, through
											harassing various different organizations, what they found was inconsistent.
											And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports,
											the 10,000-page long documents that have
											the best possible rendition of the information,
											they were told they weren&#39;t allowed to have them.
											And if you want to read the full correspondence

											And the most staggering thing of all of this, to me,
											is that not only is this a problem, not only do we recognize
											that this is a problem, but we&#39;ve had to suffer fake fixes.
											We&#39;ve had people pretend that this is a problem that&#39;s been fixed.
											First of all, we had trials registers, and everybody said,
											oh, it&#39;s okay. We&#39;ll get everyone to register their trials, they&#39;ll post the protocol,
											they&#39;ll say what they&#39;re going to do before they do it,
											and then afterwards we&#39;ll be able to check and see if all the trials which
											have been conducted and completed have been published.
											But people didn&#39;t bother to use those registers.
											And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along,
											and they said, oh, well, we will hold the line.
											We won&#39;t publish any journals, we won&#39;t publish any trials,
											unless they&#39;ve been registered before they began.
											But they didn&#39;t hold the line. In 2008, a study was conducted
											which showed that half of all of trials published by journals
											edited by members of the ICMJE
											weren&#39;t properly registered, and a quarter of them weren&#39;t registered at all.
											And then finally, the FDA Amendment Act was passed
											a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts
											a trial must post the results of that trial within one year.
											And in the BMJ, in the first edition of January, 2012,
											you can see a study which looks to see if people kept
											to that ruling, and it turns out that only one in five
											have done so.

											And this is not a difficult problem to fix.
											We need to force people to publish all trials
											conducted in humans, including the older trials,
											because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008,
											and I don&#39;t know what world it is in which we&#39;re only

											We need to publish all trials in humans,

the sensationalized -- and now-refuted -- link between vaccines and autism. With that sentence Ben Goldacre fired the starting shot of a crusade waged from the pages of <em>The Guardian</em> from 2003 to 2011, on an addicitve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/bengoldacre\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>  feed, and in bestselling books, including <a href=\"http://geni.us/badscience\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bad Science</em></a> and his latest, <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/badpharma\" target=\"_blank\">Bad Pharma</a>, </em>which puts the $600 billion global pharmaceutical industry under the microscope. What he reveals is a fascinating, terrifying mess. <br /><br />Goldacre was trained in medicine at Oxford and London, and works as an academic in epidemiology. Helped along by this inexhaustible supply of material, he also travels the speaking circuit, promoting skepticism and nerdish curiosity with fire, wit, fast delivery and a lovable kind of exasperation. (He might even convince you that real science, sober reporting and reason are going to win in the end.) </p><p>As he writes, &quot;If you&#39;re a journalist who misrepresents science for the sake of a headline, a politician more interested in spin than evidence, or an advertiser who loves pictures of molecules in little white coats, then beware: your days are numbered.&quot;</p><p>Read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/21/drugs-industry-scandal-ben-goldacre\" target=\"_blank\">an excerpt of <em>Bad Pharma</em> &gt;&gt; </a> </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Ben Goldacre","tags":["cancer","medicine","science","pharmaceuticals","medical research","data","activism","corruption","health","health care","illness","public health"],"title":"What doctors don't know about the drugs they prescribe","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2324033}]}
