											Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages
											that I&#39;ve spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks,
											as I&#39;ve been to 17 countries I think I&#39;m up to, on this crazy tour I&#39;ve been doing,
											checking out various aspects of the project that we&#39;re doing.
											And I&#39;m going to tell you a little bit about later on.
											And visiting some pretty incredible places,
											places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice —
											I was here a month ago.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that
											is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.
											You see some incredible stuff.
											And you get to make these spot comparisons
											between people all around the globe.
											And the thing that you really take away from that,
											the kind of surface thing that you take away from it,
											is not that we&#39;re all one, although I&#39;m going to tell you about that,
											but rather how different we are.
											There is so much diversity around the globe.
											6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people,
											all different colors, shapes, sizes.
											You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that,
											and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											How do we explain that diversity?
											Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to talk about today,
											is how we&#39;re using the tools of genetics,
											population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity,
											and how long it took.
											Now, the problem of human diversity,
											like all big scientific questions —
											how do you explain something like that —
											can be broken down into sub-questions.
											And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											First one is really a question of origins.
											Do we all share a common origin, in fact?
											And given that we do — and that&#39;s the assumption
											everybody, I think, in this room would make — when was that?
											When did we originate as a species?
											How long have we been divergent from each other?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And the second question is related, but slightly different.
											If we do spring from a common source,
											how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe,
											and in the process generate all of this diversity,
											the different ways of life, the different appearances,
											the different languages around the world?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology,
											seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.
											In &quot;The Descent of Man,&quot; he wrote,
											&quot;In each great region of the world, the living mammals
											are closely related to the extinct species of the same region.
											It&#39;s therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes
											closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee,
											and as these two species are now man&#39;s nearest allies,
											it&#39;s somewhat more probable that our early progenitors
											lived on the African continent than elsewhere.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we&#39;re done, we can go home — finished the origin question.
											Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,
											our common ancestry with apes.
											And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.
											Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.
											Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,
											due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.
											Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,
											and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.
											The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,
											became the gibbons and the orangutans.
											And the ones that stayed on in Africa
											evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.
											So, yes, if you&#39;re talking about our common ancestry with apes,
											it&#39;s very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But that&#39;s not really the question I&#39;m asking.
											I&#39;m asking about our human ancestry,
											things that we would recognize as being like us

											Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans

											The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,

											You think you&#39;ve got a tough job?

											He actually coined the term Homo sapiens — it means wise man in Latin.
											But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,
											&quot;Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories.&quot;
											And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,

											It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version

											It&#39;s composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.
											And it&#39;s the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
											How long is it? Well, it&#39;s billions of these subunits in length.
											A haploid genome — we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes —
											a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.
											And the whole thing, if you add it all together,
											is over six billion nucleotides long.
											If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,
											and stretch it end to end, it&#39;s around two meters long.
											If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,

											Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.
											This is a paleo-climatological map
											of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,

											You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.
											You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.
											And you can actually submit those results to the database,
											and tell us a little about your genealogical background,
											have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.

									<p>
											Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,
											after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,
											gets plowed back into the project.
											The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.
											It&#39;s a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity
											that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world
											for educational, cultural projects initiated by them.
											They apply to this fund in order to do various projects,
											and I&#39;ll show you a couple of examples.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So how are we doing on the project? We&#39;ve got about 25,000 samples
											collected from indigenous people around the world.
											The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;
											210,000 people have ordered these participation kits
											since we launched two years ago,
											which has raised around five million dollars,
											the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We&#39;ve just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.
											Projects around the world — documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,
											preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,
											language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.
											So the project is going very, very well,
											and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.
