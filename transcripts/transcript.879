											I&#39;m very fortunate to be here.
											I feel so fortunate.
											I&#39;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.
											I called my wife Leslie,
											and I said, &quot;You know, there&#39;s so many good people
											trying to do so much good.
											It feels like I&#39;ve landed in a colony of angels.&quot;
											It&#39;s a true feeling.
											But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running.

											I&#39;m a public school teacher,
											and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.
											Her name is Pam Moran
											in Albemarle County, Virginia,
											the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
											And she&#39;s a very high-tech superintendent.
											She uses smart boards, she blogs,
											she Tweets, she does Facebook,
											she does all this sort of high-tech stuff.
											She&#39;s a technology leader and instructional leader.
											But in her office,
											there&#39;s this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table —
											peeling green paint, it&#39;s kind of rickety.
											And I said, &quot;Pam, you&#39;re such a modern, cutting-edge person.
											Why is this old table in your office?&quot;

											And she told me, she said,
											&quot;You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia,
											in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia,
											and this table was in my grandfather&#39;s kitchen.
											And we&#39;d come in from playing, he&#39;d come in from plowing and working,
											and we&#39;d sit around that table every night.
											And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge
											and so many insights and so much wisdom
											come out around this table,
											I began to call it the wisdom table.
											And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,
											and it reminds me of him.
											It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes.&quot;
											The project I&#39;m going to tell you about
											is called the World Peace Game,
											and essentially it is also an empty space.
											And I&#39;d like to think of it
											as a 21st century wisdom table, really.

											It all started back in 1977.
											I was a young man,
											and I had been dropping in and out of college.
											And my parents were very patient,
											but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India
											on a mystical quest.
											And I remember the last time I came back from India —
											in my long white flowing robes
											and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses —
											and I said to my father,
											&quot;Dad, I think I&#39;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment.&quot;
											He said, &quot;Well there&#39;s one more thing you need to find.&quot;
											I said, &quot;What is that, dad?&quot; &quot;A job.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.
											So I got a degree
											and it turned out to be education.
											It was an experimental education program.
											It could have been dentistry, but the word &quot;experimental&quot; was in it,
											and so that&#39;s what I had to go for.

											And I went in for a job interview
											in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,
											bought a three-piece suit — my concession to convention —
											kept my long beard and my afro
											and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &#39;70s —
											and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.
											And I guess they were hard up for teachers
											because the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro,
											said I had the job teaching gifted children.
											And I was so shocked, so stunned,
											I got up and said, &quot;Well, thank you, but what do I do?&quot;
											(Laughter)
											Gifted education hadn&#39;t really taken hold too much.
											There weren&#39;t really many materials or things to use.
											And I said, &quot;What do I do?&quot;
											And her answer shocked me. It stunned me.
											Her answer set the template
											for the entire career I was to have after that.
											She said, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot;
											And that question cleared the space.
											There was no program directive, no manual to follow,
											no standards in gifted education
											in that way.
											And she cleared such a space
											that I endeavored from then on
											to clear a space for my students, an empty space,
											whereby they could create and make meaning
											out of their own understanding.

											So this happened in 1978,
											and I was teaching many years later,
											and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.
											His name is Chris Farina.
											Chris Farina is here today at his own cost.
											Chris, could you stand up and let them see you —
											a young, visionary filmmaker who&#39;s made a film.
											(Applause)
											This film is called &quot;World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements.&quot;
											He proposed the film to me — it&#39;s a great title.
											He proposed the film to me,
											and I said, &quot;Yeah, maybe it&#39;ll be on local TV,
											and we can say hi to our friends.&quot;
											But the film has really gone places.
											Now it&#39;s still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice,
											to get this film out.
											So we made a film
											and it turns out to be more than a story about me,
											more than a story about one teacher.
											It&#39;s a story that&#39;s a testament to teaching and teachers.
											And it&#39;s a beautiful thing.

											And the strange thing is, when I watch the film —
											I have the eerie sensation of seeing it —
											I saw myself literally disappear.
											What I saw
											was my teachers coming through me.
											I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell&#39;s
											wry smile under his handlebar mustache.
											That&#39;s the smile I use — that&#39;s his smile.
											I saw Jan Polo&#39;s flashing eyes.
											And they weren&#39;t flashing in anger,
											they were flashing in love, intense love for her students.
											And I have that kind of flash sometimes.
											And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks
											who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.
											And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.
											You know the one.
											(Laughter)
											&quot;And I&#39;m not even talking about you behind me,
											because I&#39;ve got eyes in the back of my head.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											You know that teacher?
											I didn&#39;t use that stare very often,

											And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me.

											My father, very inventive, spatial thinker.
											That&#39;s my brother Malcolm there on the right.
											And my mother,

											in segregated schools in Virginia,

											And really, I feel as though,
											when I see the film —
											I have a gesture she does, like this —
											I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture.
											I am one of her teaching gestures.
											And the beautiful thing was,

											And so this World Peace Game I&#39;d like to tell you about.
											It started out like this:
											it&#39;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board
											in an inner-city urban school, 1978.
											I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.
											We put all the problems of the world there,
											and I thought, let&#39;s let them solve it.
											I didn&#39;t want to lecture or have just book reading.
											I wanted to have them be immersed
											and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.
											So I thought, well they like to play games.
											I&#39;ll make something — I didn&#39;t say interactive;
											we didn&#39;t have that term in 1978 —
											but something interactive.
											And so we made the game,
											and it has since evolved
											to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot
											Plexiglass structure.
											And it has four Plexiglass layers.

											There&#39;s an outer space layer
											with black holes and satellites
											and research satellites and asteroid mining.
											There&#39;s an air and space level
											with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around
											and territorial air spaces and air forces,
											a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it —
											even an undersea level
											with submarines and undersea mining.
											There are four countries around the board.
											The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich; some are poor.
											They have different assets, commercial and military.
											And each country has a cabinet.
											There&#39;s a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense
											and a CFO, or Comptroller.
											I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.
											I offer them the job, they can turn it down,
											and then they choose their own cabinet.
											There&#39;s a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations.
											There&#39;s also a weather goddess
											who controls a random stock market and random weather.

											And then there&#39;s a 13-page crisis document

											So that, if one thing changes, everything else changes.
											I throw them into this complex matrix,
											and they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together.
											And so with all these crises,
											we have — let&#39;s see — ethnic and minority tensions;
											we have chemical and nuclear spills,
											nuclear proliferation.
											There&#39;s oil spills, environmental disasters,

											So I also have in the game a saboteur —

											But they&#39;re also trying to undermine everything in the game.
											And they do it secretly through misinformation
											and ambiguities and irrelevancies,
											trying to cause everyone to think more deeply.
											The saboteur is there,
											and we also read from Sun Tzu&#39;s &quot;The Art of War.&quot;
											Fourth-graders understand it — nine years old —
											and they handle that and use that
											to understand how to, not follow —
											at first they do —
											the paths to power and destruction,

											In this game we had a little girl,

											But come to find out, a few game days later —

											actually there&#39;s a negotiation period with all teams,
											and each team takes a turn,
											then we go back in negotiation, around and around,
											so each turn around is one game day.
											So a few game days later it came to light
											that we found out this major country
											was planning a military offensive
											to dominate the entire world.
											Had they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it.
											She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions

											Another example, a beautiful thing happened.
											We have a letter in the game.
											If you&#39;re a military commander and you wage troops —
											the little plastic toys on the board — and you lose them,
											I put in a letter.
											You have to write a letter to their parents —
											the fictional parents of your fictional troops —
											explaining what happened and offering your condolences.
											So you have a little bit more thought
											before you commit to combat.
											And so we had this situation come up —
											last summer actually,
											at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County —
											and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter
											and one of the other kids said, &quot;Mr. Hunter,
											let&#39;s ask — there&#39;s a parent over there.&quot;
											There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.
											&quot;Let&#39;s ask that mom to read the letter.
											It&#39;ll be more realer if she reads it.&quot;
											So we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter.
											&quot;Sure.&quot; She started reading. She read one sentence.
											She read two sentences.
											By the third sentence, she was in tears.
											I was in tears.
											Everybody understood
											that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.
											We all lose.

											We had played the game one session after school

											The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved
											and every country&#39;s asset value
											has to be increased above its starting point.
											Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.
											The World Bank president was a third-grader one time.

											So the team that was the poorest
											had gotten even poorer.
											There was no way they could win.
											And we were approaching four o&#39;clock, our cut-off time —
											there was about a minute left —
											and despair just settled over the room.
											I thought, I&#39;m failing as a teacher.
											I should have gotten it so they could have won.
											They shouldn&#39;t be failing like this.
											I&#39;ve failed them.
											And I was just feeling so sad and dejected.
											And suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair
											and he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring
											to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets,
											and he ran back to his seat, rang the bell.
											Everybody ran to his chair: there was screaming;
											there was yelling, waving of their dossiers.
											They get these dossiers full of secret documents.
											They were gesticulating; they were running around.
											I didn&#39;t know what they were doing. I&#39;d lost control of my classroom.

											&quot;we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.
											And we&#39;ve got 600 billion dollars.
											We&#39;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.
											And if they accept it, it&#39;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game.
											Will you accept it?&quot;
											And there are three seconds left on the clock.
											Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country,
											and he says, &quot;Yes.&quot;
											And the game is won.

In India, inspired by Ghandi&#39;s philosophy, he began to think about the role of the schoolteacher in creating a more peaceful world. <br /><br />As his online biography says: &quot;Accepting the reality of violence, he would seek to incorporate ways to explore harmony in various situations. This exploration would take form in the framework of a game &ndash; something that students would enjoy. Within the game data space, they would be challenged, while enhancing collaborative and communication skills.&quot;<br /><br />In 1978, at the Richmond Community High School, Hunter led the first sessions of his <a href=\"http://theworldpeacegame.com/\" target=\"_blank\">World Peace Game</a>, a hands-on political simulation.
