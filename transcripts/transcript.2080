<title>Mike Velings: The case for fish farming | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We&#39;re headed towards a global food crisis: Nearly 3 billion people depend on the ocean for food, and at our current rate we already take more fish from the ocean than it can naturally replace. In this fact-packed, eye-opening talk, entrepreneur and conservationist Mike Velings proposes a solution: Aquaculture, or fish farming. &quot;We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters,&quot; he says, echoing Jacques Cousteau. &quot;The day will come where people will demand farmed fish on their plates that&#39;s farmed well and farmed healthy -- and refuse anything less.&quot;" />

<meta content='We&#x0027;re headed towards a global food crisis: Nearly 3 billion people depend on the ocean for food, and at our current rate we already take more fish from the ocean than it can naturally replace. In this fact-packed, eye-opening talk, entrepreneur and conservationist Mike Velings proposes a solution: Aquaculture, or fish farming. "We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters," he says, echoing Jacques Cousteau. "The day will come where people will demand farmed fish on their plates that&#x0027;s farmed well and farmed healthy — and refuse anything less."' itemprop='description'>

											So I come from the tallest
people on the planet —
											the Dutch.
											It hasn&#39;t always been this way.
											In fact, all across the globe,
people have been gaining height.
											In the last 150 years,
											in developed countries,
											on average, we have gotten
10 centimeters taller.
											And scientists have a lot
of theories about why this is,
											but almost all of them involve nutrition,
											namely the increase of dairy and meat.

											In the last 50 years,
											global meat consumption
has more than quadrupled,
											from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.
											Something similar has been going on
with milk and eggs.
											In every society where incomes have risen,
so has protein consumption.
											And we know that globally,
we are getting richer.
											And as the middle class is on the rise,
so is our global population,
											from 7 billion of us today
to 9.7 billion by 2050,
											which means that by 2050,
											we are going to need at least
70 percent more protein
											than what is available to humankind today.
											And the latest prediction of the UN
puts that population number,
											by the end of this century, at 11 billion,
											which means that we are going
to need a lot more protein.

											WWF recently published a report
showing that just in the last 40 years,
											our global marine life
has been slashed in half.
											And another recent report suggests
that of our largest predatory species,

											over 90 percent has disappeared

fishing initiatives across the planet

											all of these initiatives are working
towards keeping current catch constant.
