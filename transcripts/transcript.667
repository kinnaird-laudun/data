											I want to talk about
											what we learn from conservatives.
											And I&#39;m at a stage in life where I&#39;m yearning for my old days,
											so I want to confess to you
											that when I was a kid,
											indeed, I was a conservative.
											I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,
											a leader in the Teenage Republicans.
											Indeed, I was the youngest member
											of any delegation
											in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan
											to be the Republican nominee for president.

											Now, I know what you&#39;re thinking.
											(Laughter)
											You&#39;re thinking, &quot;That&#39;s not what the Internets say.&quot;
											You&#39;re thinking, &quot;Wikipedia doesn&#39;t say this fact.&quot;
											And indeed, this is just one of the examples
											of the junk that flows across the tubes
											in these Internets here.
											Wikipedia reports that this guy,
											this former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania
											was, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people
											at the Republican National Convention,
											but it&#39;s just not true.
											(Laughter)
											Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											All right. Okay, so ... perfect.
											Perfect.
											(Laughter)
											Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.
											Okay.
											Finally, truth will be brought here.
											Okay, see? It&#39;s done. It&#39;s almost done. Here we go.
											&quot;... Youngest Republican,&quot; okay, we&#39;re finished.
											That&#39;s it. Please save this.

											But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives —
											not so much this issue of the 1980 convention —
											the thing to think about is this:
											They go to church.
											Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.
											I&#39;m not talking about that only conservatives go to church.
											And I&#39;m not talking about the God thing.
											I don&#39;t want to get into that, you know; that&#39;s not my point.
											They go to church, by which I mean,
											they do lots of things for free for each other.
											They hold potluck dinners.
											Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.
											They serve food to poor people.
											They share, they give,
											they give away for free.
											And it&#39;s the very same people
											leading Wall Street firms
											who, on Sundays, show up
											and share.
											And not only food, right.

											These very same people
											are strong believers, in lots of contexts,
											in the limits on the markets.
											They are in many important places
											against markets.
											Indeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.
											But they&#39;re very keen that we don&#39;t
											let money drop into that relationship,
											else it turns into something like this.
											They want to regulate us, those conservatives,
											to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.
											Because they understand:
											There are places for the market
											and places where the market should not exist,
											where we should be free
											to enjoy the fellowship of others.
											They recognize: Both of these things have to live together.

											And the second great thing about conservatives:
											they get ecology.
											Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century
											who taught us about
											environmental thinking — Teddy Roosevelt.
											They first taught us about ecology
											in the context of natural resources.
											And then they began to teach us in the context of
											innovation, economics.
											They understand, in that context,
											&quot;free.&quot; They understand &quot;free&quot; is an important
											essential part of the
											cultural ecology as well.
											That&#39;s the thing I want you to think about them.

											Now, I know

											So here&#39;s exhibit number one.
											I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez,
											a libertarian who works at the, for many people,
											&quot;evil&quot; Cato Institute.
											Okay, so Julian made this video.

											All of the great Disney works
											were works that took works that
											were in the public domain and remixed them,
											or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them,
											to celebrate this add-on remix creativity.
											Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course,
											as &quot;Steamboat Willie,&quot;
											is a remix of the then, very dominant,
											very popular &quot;Steamboat Bill&quot;
											by Buster Keaton.
											This man was a remixer extraordinaire.

											But then the company passes

											This is the mastermind behind
											the eventual passage of what we call
											the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,
											extending the term of existing copyrights
											by 20 years,
											so that no one could do to Disney
											what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.
											Now, when we tried to challenge this,
											going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there —
											if we could get them to wake up to this — to strike it down,
											we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners
											including this right-wing
											Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman,
											who said he would join our brief
											only if the word &quot;no brainer&quot;
											was in the brief somewhere.
											(Laughter)
											But apparently, no brains
											existed in this place
											when Democrats passed and signed

											Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote:

											Okay, for a second example,
											think about this cultural hero,
											icon on the Left,
											creator of this character.
											Look at the site that he built: &quot;Star Wars&quot; MashUps,
											inviting people to come and use their creative energy
											to produce a new generation of attention

											Read the license.
											The license for these remixers
											assigns all of the rights

											The mashup is owned by Lucas.
											Indeed, anything you add to the mashup,
											music you might add,
											Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right
											to exploit that for free.
											There is no creator here to be recognized.
											The creator doesn&#39;t have any rights.

											a respect for ownership,
											the respect we should give the creator,
											the remixer, the owner, the property owner,
											the copyright owner
											of this extraordinarily powerful stuff,
											and not a generation of sharecroppers.
											Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here,
											lessons about openness.
											Our lives are sharing activities,
											at least in part.
											Even for the head of Goldman Sachs,
											at least in part.
											And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have
											well-protected spaces of fair use.

									<p>
											That&#39;s number one. Number two:
											This ecology of sharing
											needs freedom
											within which to create.
											Freedom, which means without permission from anyone,
											the ability to create.
											And number three: We need to
											respect the creator,
											the creator of these remixes
											through rights that are
											directly tied to them.
											Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit
											Creative Commons.
											Actually, it&#39;s not a right-wing nonprofit,
											but of course — let me just tie it here —
											the Creative Commons, which is
											offering authors this simple way to mark their content
											with the freedoms
											they intended to carry.

											So that we go from a &quot;all rights reserved&quot; world
											to a &quot;some rights reserved&quot; world
											so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content,
											building and creating
											on the basis of this
											creative copyrighted work.
											These tools that we built
											enable this sharing in parts
											through licenses that make it clear
											and a freedom to create
											without requiring permission first
											because the permission has already been granted
											and a respect for the creator because it builds upon
											a copyright the creator
											has licensed freely.
											And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy
											that&#39;s obviously developed around these licenses,
											as now more than 350 million digital objects
											are out there, licensed freely
											in this way.

											Now that picture of an ecology of creativity,
											the picture of an ecology
											of balanced creativity,
											is that the ecology of creativity we have right now?
											Well, as you all know,
											not many of us believe we do.
											I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity
											just last week.
											I created a video which was based
											on a Wireside Chat that I&#39;d given,
											and I uploaded it to YouTube.
											I then got this email from YouTube
											weirdly notifying me
											that there was content in that
											owned by the mysterious WMG
											that matched their content ID.
											So I didn&#39;t think much about it.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then on Twitter, somebody said to me,
											&quot;Your talk on YouTube was DMCA&#39;d. Was that your purpose?&quot;
											imagining that I had this deep conspiracy
											to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.
											I answered, &quot;No.&quot; I didn&#39;t even think about it.
											But then I went to the site
											and all of the audio in my site had been silenced.
											My whole 45-minute video
											had been silenced
											because there were snippets in that video,
											a video about fair use,
											that included Warner Music Group music.
											Now, interestingly,
											they still sold ads for that music,
											if you played the silent video.
											You could still buy the music,

											So I did what the current regime

											And then in an extraordinarily
											Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way
											you&#39;ve actually got to type out these words
											and get them right
											to reassert your freedom to speak.
											And I felt like I was in third grade again.
											&quot;I will not put tacks on the teacher&#39;s chair.
											I will not put tacks on the teacher&#39;s chair.&quot;

											Now, that was the story of me then,

											Let me come back to now,
											now when I&#39;m a little leftist —
											I&#39;m certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty —
											And I wonder, can we on the Left
											expect to build this
											ecology of freedom, now,
											in a world where
											we know the extraordinarily powerful
											influences against it,
											where even icons of the Left like this
											entertain and push bills
											that would effectively ban the requirement
											of open access for government-funded research?
											The president, who has supported
											a process that secretly negotiates agreements,
											which effectively lock us into the insane system
											of DMCA
											that we have adopted
											and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you&#39;re out
											that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.

											So here&#39;s the lessons of openness
											that I think we need to learn.
											Openness is a commitment
											to a certain set of values.
											We need to speak of those values.
											The value of freedom. It&#39;s a value of community.
											It&#39;s a value of the limits in regulation.
											It&#39;s a value respecting the creator.
											Now, if we can learn those values
											from at least some influences on the Right,
											if we can take them and incorporate them,
											maybe we could do a little trade.
											We learn those values on the Left,
											and maybe they&#39;ll do health care
											or global warming legislation or something in the Right.

He was a founding board member of <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons</a>, an organization that builds better copyright practices through principles established first by the open-source software community.</p><p>In 2007, just after <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity.html\" target=\"_blank\">his last TED Talk</a>, Lessig announced he was leaving the field of IP and Internet policy, and moving on to a more fundamental problem that blocks all types of sensible policy -- the corrupting influence of money in American politics.</p><p>In 2011, Lessig founded <a href=\"http://www.rootstrikers.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Rootstrikers</a>, an organization dedicated to changing the influence of money in Congress. In his latest book, <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/republiclost\" target=\"_blank\">Republic, Lost</a>, </em>he shows just how far the U.S. has spun off course -- and how citizens can regain control. As <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> wrote about him, &ldquo;Mr. Lessig&rsquo;s vision is at once profoundly pessimistic -- the integrity of the nation is collapsing under the best of intentions --and deeply optimistic. Simple legislative surgery, he says, can put the nation back on the path to greatness.&rdquo;</p><p>Read an excerpt of <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2013/04/03/how-we-can-make-elections-about-the-people-not-just-funders-an-excerpt-of-lawrence-lessigs-new-ted-book-lesterland/\" target=\"_blank\">Lessig&#39;s new book, <em>Lesterland</em> &gt;&gt;</a> </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Lawrence Lessig","tags":["Internet","TEDx","law","music","online video","technology","web"],"title":"Re-examining the remix","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":396669}]}
