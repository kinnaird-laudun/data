											I want to tell you
about the future of money.
											Let&#39;s start with a story
about this culture
											that lived in Micronesia
in the early 1900s, called the Yap.
											Now, I want to tell you about the Yap
											because their form of money
is really interesting.
											They use these limestone discs
called Rai stones.
											Now, the Yap don&#39;t actually
move these Rai stones around
											or exchange them the way
we do with our coins,
											because Rai stones can get
to be pretty massive.
											The largest is about four tons
and 12 feet across.
											So the Yap just keep track
of who owns part of what stone.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											There&#39;s a story about these sailors
											that were transporting a stone
across the ocean
											when they ran into some trouble
and the stone actually fell in.
											The sailors got back to the main island
											and they told everyone what had happened.
											And everyone decided that, actually, yes,
											the sailors had the stone
and — why not? — it still counted.
											Even though it was
at the bottom of the ocean,
											it was still part of the Yap economy.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											You might think that this
was just a small culture
											a hundred years ago.
											But things like this happen
in the Western world as well,
											and the Yap actually still use
a form of these stones.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In 1932, the Bank of France
asked the United States
											to convert their holdings
from dollars into gold.
											But it was too inconvenient
to think about actually shipping
											all of that gold over to Europe.
											So instead, someone went to where
that gold was being stored
											and they just labeled it
as belonging to France now.
											And everyone agreed
that France owned the gold.
											It&#39;s just like those Rai stones.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The point I want to make
with these two examples
											is that there&#39;s nothing
inherently valuable
											about a dollar or a stone or a coin.
											The only reason these things
have any value
											is because we&#39;ve all decided they should.
											And because we&#39;ve decided that,
											they do.
											Money is about the exchanges
and the transactions
											that we have with each other.
											Money isn&#39;t anything objective.
											It&#39;s about a collective story
that we tell each other about value.
											A collective fiction.
											And that&#39;s a really powerful concept.

											In the past two decades,
											we&#39;ve begun to use digital money.
											So I get paid via direct deposit,
											I pay my rent via bank transfer,
											I pay my taxes online.
											And every month,
											a small amount of money
is deducted from my paycheck
											and invested in mutual funds
in my retirement account.
											All of these interactions
											are literally just changing
1&#39;s and 0&#39;s on computers.
											There&#39;s not even anything physical,
like a stone or a coin.
											Digital money makes it
so that I can pay someone around the world
											in seconds.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now when this works,
											it&#39;s because there are large institutions
underwriting every 1 or 0
											that changes on a computer.
											And when it doesn&#39;t,
											it&#39;s often the fault
of those large institutions.
											Or at least, it&#39;s up to them
to fix the problem.
											And a lot of times, they don&#39;t.
											There&#39;s a lot of friction in the system.
											How long did it take
the US credit card companies
											to implement chip and pin?
											Half my credit cards
still don&#39;t work in Europe.
											That&#39;s friction.
											Transferring money across borders
and across currencies
											is really expensive:
											friction.
											An entrepreneur in India

than just a static unit of value,

											Cryptocurrencies are the first step
of this evolution.
											Cryptocurrencies are digital money
											that isn&#39;t run by any government or bank.
											It&#39;s money designed to work
in a world without intermediaries.
											Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous
cryptocurrency,
											but there are hundreds of them.
											There&#39;s Ethereum, Litecoin,
Stellar, Dogecoin,
											and those are just a few
of the more popular ones.
											And these things are real money.
											The sushi restaurant down my street
											takes Bitcoin.
											I have an app on my phone
that I can use to buy sashimi.
											But it&#39;s not just for small transactions.
											In March, there was a transaction
that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.
											That&#39;s the equivalent
of 40 million US dollars.

											Cryptocurrencies are based on
a special field of mathematics
											called cryptography.
											Cryptography is the study
of how to secure communication,
											and it&#39;s about two
really important things:
											masking information so it can
be hidden in plain sight,
											and verifying a piece
of information&#39;s source.
											Cryptography underpins
so many of the systems around us.
											And it&#39;s so powerful that at times
											the US government has actually
classified it as a weapon.

											During World War II,
breaking cryptosystems like Enigma
											was critical to decoding
enemy transmissions
											and turning the tide of the war.
											Today, anyone with a modern
web browser is running
											a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.
											It&#39;s what we use to secure
our interactions on the Internet.
											It&#39;s what makes it safe for us
to type our passwords in
											and to send financial
information to websites.
											So what the banks used to give us —
											trustworthy digital money transfer —
											we can now get with a clever
application of cryptography.
											And this means that we don&#39;t
have to rely on the banks anymore
											to secure our transactions.
											We can do it ourselves.

											Imagine that we had this magic paper.
											So the way that this paper works
is I can give you a sheet of it
											and if you write something on it,
											it will magically appear
on my piece as well.
											Let&#39;s say we just give everyone this paper
											and everyone writes down
the transfers that they&#39;re doing
											in the Bitcoin system.
											All of these transfers get copied
around to everyone else&#39;s pieces of paper.
											And I can look at mine
											and I&#39;ll have a list of all
of the transfers that are happening
											in the entire Bitcoin economy.
											This is actually what&#39;s happening
with the Bitcoin blockchain,
											which is a list of all
of the transactions in Bitcoin.
											Except, it&#39;s not done through paper.
											It&#39;s done through computer code,
											running on thousands
of networked computers
											around the world.
											All of these computers

											But where do bitcoins actually come from?
											Well, the code is designed
to create new Bitcoin

											And the way that it works
is that to get those Bitcoin,
											I have to solve a puzzle —
a random cryptographic puzzle.
											Imagine that we had 15 dice,
											and we were throwing these dice
over and over again.
											Whenever the dice come up all sixes,
											we say that we win.
											This is very close to what these computers
are all actually doing.

											There are actually people
all over the world running this software,
											and we call them Bitcoin miners.
											Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner.
											You can go download the software right now
											and run it in your computer
and try to collect some bitcoins.
											I can&#39;t say that I would recommend it,
											because right now, the puzzle is so hard
and the network is so powerful,
											that if I tried to mine
Bitcoin on my laptop,
											I probably wouldn&#39;t see any
for about two million years.
											The miners, professional miners,
use this special hardware
											that&#39;s designed to solve
the puzzle really fast.
											Now, the Bitcoin network
and all of this special hardware,
											there are estimates
that the amount of energy it uses
											is equivalent to that of a small country.
											So, the first set of cryptocurrencies
											are a little bit slow
and a little bit cumbersome.

											Cryptocurrencies are the first step

											And in a world with programmable money,
											I can pay anyone else securely
											without having to sign up
or ask permission,
											or do a conversion or worry
about my money getting stuck.
											And I can send money around the world.
											This is a really amazing thing.
											It&#39;s the idea of permission-less innovation.
											The Internet caused
an explosion of innovation,
											because it was built upon
an open architecture.
											And just like the Internet
changed the way we communicate,
											programmable money is going
to change the way we pay,
											allocate and decide on value.

											So what kind of world

rent out my healthcare data

											They can run large-scale data analysis
											and provide me with a cryptographic proof
											that shows they&#39;re only using my data
in a way that we agreed.
											And they can pay me
for what they find out.
											Instead of signing up
for streaming services
											and getting a cable bill,
											what if my television analyzed
my watching habits
											and recommended well-priced content
that fit within my budget
											that I would enjoy?
											Imagine an Internet without ads,
											because instead of paying
with our attention when we view content,
											we just pay.

											Interestingly, things like micro-payments
											are actually going to change

											people will use their money

											for more constructive things.

											Right now, it&#39;s like we&#39;re in a world

											The first cryptocurrency,
like the first car,

											Digital money,
like the horse and carriage,
											works pretty well,
											and the whole world economy
is built on it.
											If you were the first person on your block

											your neighbors would probably
think you were crazy:
											&quot;Why would you want

											just like cash is used for crime

											When all of our transactions are online,

who can see what we do?
											Who&#39;s advantaged

											All new technology comes with trade-offs.
											The Internet brought us
a lot of ways to waste time.
											But it also greatly
increased productivity.
											Mobile phones are annoying
											because they make me feel
like I have to stay connected to work
											all the time.
											But they also help me stay connected
to friends and family.
											The new sharing economy
is going to eliminate some jobs.
											But it&#39;s also going to create
new, flexible forms of employment.
											With programmable money,
											we decouple the need
for large, trusted institutions
											from the architecture of the network.
											And this pushes innovation in money
out to the edges, where it belongs.
											Programmable money democratizes money.
											And because of this,
things are going to change and unfold
											in ways that we can&#39;t even predict.
