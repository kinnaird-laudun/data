<title>Elaine Morgan: I believe we evolved from aquatic apes | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Elaine Morgan was a tenacious proponent of a theory that is not widely accepted. The aquatic ape hypothesis lays out the idea that humans evolved from primate ancestors who dwelt in watery habitats. Hear her spirited defense of the idea -- and her theory on why science doesn&#39;t take it seriously. NOTE: Statements in this talk have been challenged by scientists working in this field.

<meta content='Elaine Morgan was a tenacious proponent of a theory that is not widely accepted.

											Well, this is 2009.
											And it&#39;s the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.
											And all over the world, eminent evolutionists
											are anxious to celebrate this.
											And what they&#39;re planning to do is to enlighten us
											on almost every aspect
											of Darwin and his life,
											and how he changed our thinking.
											I say almost every aspect,
											because there is one aspect of this story
											which they have thrown no light on.
											And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it
											and to talk about something else.
											So I&#39;m going to talk about it.
											It&#39;s the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?
									</p>
								</div>

									<p>
											We get the geneticists keeping on telling us
											how extremely closely we are related — hardly any genes of difference,
											very, very closely related.
											And yet, when you look at the phenotypes,
											there&#39;s a chimp, there&#39;s a man;
											they&#39;re astoundingly different,
											no resemblance at all.
											I&#39;m not talking about airy-fairy stuff
											about culture or psychology, or behavior.
											I&#39;m talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty,
											measurable physical differences.
											They, that one,
											is hairy and walking on four legs.
											That one is a naked biped. Why?
											I mean —
											(Laughter)
											if I&#39;m a good Darwinist, I&#39;ve got to believe
											there&#39;s a reason for that.
											If we changed so much, something must have happened.
											What happened?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.
											Everybody knew the answer.
											They knew what happened.
											The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;
											our ancestors went out onto the plain.
											That explained everything.
											We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,
											or to chase after animals,
											or to free our hands for weapons.
											And we got so overheated in the chase
											that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
											Everybody knew that, for generations.

									<p>
											But then, in the &#39;90s, something began to unravel.
											The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely
											at the accompanying microfauna
											that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
											And they weren&#39;t savanna species.
											And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren&#39;t savanna herbivores.
											And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze
											fossilized pollen.
											Shock, horror.
											The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.
											Some of it even came from lianas,
											those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.

									<p>
											So we&#39;re left with a situation where
											we know that our earliest ancestors
											were moving around on four legs in the trees,
											before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.
											This is not something I&#39;ve made up.
											It&#39;s not a minority theory.
											Everybody agrees with it.

											Professor Tobias came over from South Africa
											and spoke to University College London.
											He said, &quot;Everything I&#39;ve been telling you for the last 20 years,
											forget about it. It was wrong.
											We&#39;ve got to go back to square one and start again.&quot;
											It made him very unpopular. They didn&#39;t want to go back to square one.

											I mean, it&#39;s a terrible thing to happen.
											You&#39;ve got this beautiful paradigm.
											You&#39;ve believed it through generations.
											Nobody has questioned it.
											You&#39;ve been constructing fanciful things on top of it,

											Well, we know the answer because
											Thomas S. Kuhn
											wrote a seminal treatise
											about this back in 1962.
											He said what scientists do
											when a paradigm fails
											is, guess what — they carry on as if nothing had happened.
											(Laughter)
											If they haven&#39;t got a paradigm they can&#39;t ask the question.
											So they say, &quot;Yes it&#39;s wrong,
											but supposing it was right ...&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And the only other option open to them
											is to stop asking the questions.
											So that is what they have done now.
											That&#39;s why you don&#39;t hear them talking about it. It&#39;s yesterday&#39;s question.

											Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.
											It&#39;s what we ought to be doing.
											Aaron Filler from Harvard said,
											&quot;Isn&#39;t it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?
											I mean, why don&#39;t we talk about, well, there&#39;s chromosomes, and there&#39;s genes.
											And we just record what we see.&quot;
											Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
											He knew all about that kind of science.
											And he called it hypothesis-free science.
											And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
											And if you&#39;re going to say,
											&quot;I&#39;m going to stop talking about selective pressures,&quot;
											you can take &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; and throw it out of the window,
											for it&#39;s about nothing else but selective pressures.

											And the irony of it is,
											that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse
											where we didn&#39;t have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.
											There was one waiting in the wings.
											It had been waiting there since 1960
											when Alister Hardy, a marine biologist,
											said, &quot;I think what happened,
											perhaps our ancestors
											had a more aquatic existence
											for some of the time.&quot;
											He kept it to himself for 30 years.
											But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.
											All his colleagues said, &quot;This is outrageous.
											You&#39;ve exposed us to public ridicule!
											You must never do that again.&quot;
											And at that time, it became set in stone:
											the aquatic theory should be dumped
											with the UFOs and the yetis,
											as part of the lunatic fringe of science.

									<p>
											Well I don&#39;t think that.
											I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
											I&#39;d like to talk about just a handful
											of what have been called the
											hallmarks of mankind,
											the things that made us different from everybody else,
											and all our relatives.
											Let&#39;s look at our naked skin.
											It&#39;s obvious that most of the things we think about
											that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,
											are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus,
											the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.
											And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.
											And you&#39;re tempted to think, well perhaps,
											could that be why we are naked?

											I suggested it and people said, &quot;No no no.
											I mean, look at the elephant.
											You&#39;ve forgotten all about the elephant haven&#39;t you?&quot;
											So back in 1982 I said,
											&quot;Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.&quot;
											Peals of merry laughter!
											&quot;That crazy woman. She&#39;s off again. She&#39;ll say anything won&#39;t she?&quot;
											But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
											This has come &#39;round to be that all those naked pachyderms
											have aquatic ancestors.
											The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.

									<p>
											Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros
											and said, &quot;Seems to have spent most of its time in the water.&quot;
											So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
											As an absolute connection, it only works one way.
											You can&#39;t say all aquatic animals are naked,
											because look at the sea otter.
											But you can say
											that every animal that has become naked
											has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime,
											or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.
											The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat,
											which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.

											And take bipedality.
											Here you can&#39;t find anybody to compare it with,
											because we&#39;re the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
											But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys
											are capable of walking on two legs,
											if they want to, for a short time.
											There is only one circumstance in which they
											always, all of them, walk on two legs,
											and that is when they are wading through water.
											Do you think that&#39;s significant?
											David Attenborough thinks it&#39;s significant,
											as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.

											Look at the fat layer.
											We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:
											nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
											Why should it be there?
											Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,
											the fat that in most land mammals
											is deposited inside the body wall,
											around the kidneys and the intestines and so on,
											has started to migrate to the outside,
											and spread out in a layer inside the skin.
											In the whale it&#39;s complete:
											no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.
											We cannot avoid the suspicion
											that in our case it&#39;s started to happen.
											We have got skin lined with this layer.
											It&#39;s the only possible explanation of why humans,
											if they&#39;re very unlucky,
											can become grossly obese,
											in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.

											The question of why we can speak.
											We can speak.
											And the gorilla can&#39;t speak. Why?
											Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that —
											purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.
											You can&#39;t even train a gorilla to say &quot;Ah&quot; on request.

											And now we&#39;ve got to look to the future.
											Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.
											Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.
											&quot;Yeah well we don&#39;t talk about that. Let&#39;s talk about something interesting.&quot;
											That would be very sad.
											The second thing that could happen
											is that some young genius will arrive,
											and say, &quot;I&#39;ve found it.

											So if it&#39;s going to come and it&#39;s going to happen,

											Academia says no.
											They decided in 1960,

											The professional journals

She was an award-winning television writer (she won two BAFTAs and Writers&#39; Guild honors) for <em>Campion, How Green Was My Valley</em> and <em>Testament of Youth</em>.
