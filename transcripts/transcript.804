<title>Deborah Rhodes: A test that finds 3x more breast tumors, and why it&#39;s not available to you | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Working with a team of physicists, Dr. Deborah Rhodes developed a new tool for tumor detection that&#39;s 3 times as effective as traditional mammograms for women with dense breast tissue. The life-saving implications are stunning. So why haven&#39;t we heard of it? Rhodes shares the story behind the tool&#39;s creation, and the web of politics and economics that keep it from mainstream use." />

											There are two groups of women
											when it comes to screening mammography —
											women in whom mammography works very well
											and has saved thousands of lives
											and women in whom it doesn&#39;t work well at all.
											Do you know which group you&#39;re in?
											If you don&#39;t, you&#39;re not alone.
											Because the breast has become
											a very political organ.
											The truth has become lost
											in all the rhetoric
											coming from the press, politicians,
											radiologists
											and medical imaging companies.
											I will do my best this morning
											to tell you what I think is the truth.
											But first, my disclosures.
											I am not a breast cancer survivor.
											I&#39;m not a radiologist.
											I don&#39;t have any patents,
											and I&#39;ve never received any money from a medical imaging company,
											and I am not seeking your vote.

											What I am
											is a doctor of internal medicine
											who became passionately interested in this topic
											about 10 years ago
											when a patient asked me a question.
											She came to see me
											after discovering a breast lump.
											Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer
											in her 40s.
											She and I were both very pregnant at that time,
											and my heart just ached for her,
											imagining how afraid she must be.
											Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.
											But she asked me a question:
											how confident was I
											that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram
											if she developed one?
											So I studied her mammogram,
											and I reviewed the radiology literature,
											and I was shocked to discover
											that, in her case,
											our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram
											were less than the toss of a coin.

											You may recall a year ago
											when a firestorm erupted
											after the United States Preventive Services Task Force
											reviewed the world&#39;s mammography screening literature
											and issued a guideline
											recommending against screening mammograms
											in women in their 40s.
											Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,
											even though most of them weren&#39;t in anyway familiar
											with the mammography studies.
											It took the Senate just 17 days
											to ban the use of the guidelines
											in determining insurance coverage.
											Radiologists were outraged
											by the guidelines.
											The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States
											issued the following quote
											to the Washington Post.
											The radiologists were, in turn, criticized
											for protecting their own financial self-interest.
											But in my view,
											the radiologists are heroes.
											There&#39;s a shortage of radiologists
											qualified to read mammograms,
											and that&#39;s because mammograms are one of the most complex
											of all radiology studies to interpret,
											and because radiologists
											are sued more often
											over missed breast cancer
											than any other cause.
											But that very fact is telling.

											Where there is this much legal smoke,
											there is likely to be some fire.
											The factor most responsible for that fire
											is breast density.
											Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat —
											pictured here in yellow —
											versus connective and epithelial tissues —
											pictured in pink.
											And that proportion
											is primarily genetically determined.
											Two-thirds of women in their 40s
											have dense breast tissue,
											which is why mammography doesn&#39;t work as well in them.
											And although breast density generally declines with age,
											up to a third of women
											retain dense breast tissue
											for years after menopause.

											So how do you know if your breasts are dense?
											Well, you need to read the details
											of your mammography report.
											Radiologists classify breast density
											into four categories
											based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.
											If the breast is less than 25 percent dense,
											that&#39;s called fatty-replaced.
											The next category
											is scattered fibroglandular densities,
											followed by heterogeneously dense
											and extremely dense.
											And breasts that fall into these two categories
											are considered dense.
											The problem with breast density
											is that it&#39;s truly the wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing.
											Both tumors and dense breast tissue
											appear white on a mammogram,
											and the X-ray often can&#39;t distinguish between the two.

											but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.

											Now it&#39;s bad enough that breast density

											but it turns out
											that it&#39;s also a powerful predictor
											of your risk for breast cancer.
											It&#39;s a stronger risk factor

											Mammograms have been around since the 1960&#39;s,
											and it&#39;s changed very little.
											There have been surprisingly few innovations,
											until digital mammography was approved
											in 2000.
											Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,
											but the images
											can be stored and manipulated digitally,
											just like we can with a digital camera.
											The U.S. has invested
											four billion dollars
											converting to digital mammography equipment,
											and what have we gained from that investment?
											In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,
											digital mammography was found
											to be no better over all
											than traditional mammography,
											and in fact, it was worse in older women.
											But it was better in one group,
											and that was women under 50
											who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,
											and in those women,
											digital mammography found twice as many cancers,
											but it still only found 60 percent.
											So digital mammography
											has been a giant leap forward
											for manufacturers
											of digital mammography equipment,
											but it&#39;s been a very small step forward for
											womankind.

											What about ultrasound?
											Ultrasound generates more biopsies
											that are unnecessary relative to other technologies,
											so it&#39;s not widely used.
											And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,
											but it&#39;s also very expensive.
											If we think about disruptive technology,
											we see an almost ubiquitous pattern
											of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.
											Think about iPods compared to stereos.
											But it&#39;s the exact opposite in health care.
											The machines get ever bigger
											and ever more expensive.
											Screening the average young woman with an MRI
											is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.
											It&#39;s just way too much equipment.
											One MRI scan
											costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.

											Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker
											on innovation,
											and he made the case that scientific discoveries
											are rarely the product of one individual&#39;s genius.
											Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated,
											if you can simply gather
											people with different perspectives in a room
											and get them to talk about things
											that they don&#39;t ordinarily talk about.
											It&#39;s like the essence of TED.
											He quotes one innovator who says,
											&quot;The only time a physician and a physicist get together
											is when the physicist gets sick.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											This makes no sense,
											because physicians have all kinds of problems
											that they don&#39;t realize have solutions.
											And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things
											that they don&#39;t realize are problems.
											Now, take a look at this cartoon

											So if you will allow me a little creative license,
											I will tell you the story
											of the serendipitous collision
											of my patient&#39;s problem
											with a physicist&#39;s solution.
											Shortly after her visit,
											I was introduced to a nuclear physicist
											at Mayo
											named Michael O&#39;Conner,
											who was a specialist in cardiac imaging,
											something I had nothing to do with.
											And he happened to tell me
											about a conference he&#39;d just returned from in Israel,
											where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.
											Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time
											to image the heart,
											and it had even been tried to image the breast.
											But the problem was
											that the gamma detectors
											were these huge, bulky tubes,
											and they were filled with these scintillating crystals,
											and you just couldn&#39;t get them close enough around the breast
											to find small tumors.
											But the potential advantage was
											that gamma rays, unlike X-rays,
											are not influenced by breast density.
											But this technology
											could not find tumors when they&#39;re small,
											and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
											If you can find a tumor
											when it&#39;s less than a centimeter,
											survival exceeds 90 percent,
											but drops off rapidly
											as tumor size increases.
											But Michael told me about
											a new type of gamma detector that he&#39;d seen,
											and this is it.
											It&#39;s made
											not of a bulky tube,
											but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material
											that serves as the gamma detector.
											And I started talking to him
											about this problem with breast density,
											and we realized that we might be able to get this detector
											close enough around the breast
											to actually find small tumors.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So after putting together
											a grid of these cubes with tape —
											(Laughter)
											— Michael hacked off the X-ray plate
											of a mammography machine
											that was about to be thrown out,
											and we attached the new detector,
											and we decided to call this machine
											Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.
											This is an image from our first patient.
											And you can see, using the old gamma technology,
											that it just looked like noise.
											But using our new detector,
											we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.

											So here we were, a nuclear physicist,
											an internist,
											soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,
											and two radiologists,
											and we were trying to take on
											the entrenched world of mammography
											with a machine that was held together by duct tape.
											To say that we faced
											high doses of skepticism
											in those early years
											is just a huge understatement,
											but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work
											that we chipped away with incremental modifications
											to this system.
											This is our current detector.
											And you can see that it looks a lot different.
											The duct tape is gone,
											and we added a second detector on top of the breast,
											which has further improved our tumor detection.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So how does this work?
											The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer
											that&#39;s taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,
											but not by normal cells,
											and this is the key difference from mammography.
											Mammography relies on differences
											in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,
											and we&#39;ve seen that those differences
											can be obscured in a dense breast.
											But MBI exploits
											the different molecular behavior of tumors,
											and therefore, it&#39;s impervious to breast density.
											After the injection,
											the patient&#39;s breast is placed between the detectors.
											And if you&#39;ve ever had a mammogram —
											if you&#39;re old enough to have had a mammogram —
											you know what comes next:
											pain.
											You may be surprised to know
											that mammography is the only radiologic study
											that&#39;s regulated by federal law,
											and the law requires
											that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery
											come down on your breast during this study.
											But with MBI,
											we use just light, pain-free compression.
											(Applause)
											And the detector
											then transmits the image to the computer.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So here&#39;s an example.
											You can see, on the right, a mammogram
											showing a faint tumor,
											the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.
											But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,
											as well as a second tumor,
											which profoundly influence that patient&#39;s surgical options.
											In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,
											we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors —
											one is small as three millimeters.

									<p>
											Our big break came in 2004.
											After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,
											we used these images
											to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
											And we were elated when they took a chance
											on a team of completely unknown investigators
											and funded us to study
											1,000 women with dense breasts,
											comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.
											Of the tumors that we found,
											mammography found
											only 25 percent of those tumors.
											MBI found 83 percent.
											Here&#39;s an example from that screening study.
											The digital mammogram was read as normal
											and shows lots of dense tissue,
											but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,
											which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.
											In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.
											And in this case,
											a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,
											who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,
											wanted to enroll in our study.
											And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,
											but her MBI showed an area
											of worrisome uptake,
											which we can also see on a color image.
											And this corresponded
											to a tumor the size of a golf ball.
											But fortunately it was removed
											before it had spread to her lymph nodes.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So now that we knew that this technology
											could find three times more tumors in a dense breast,
											we had to solve one very important problem.
											We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,
											and we have spent the last three years
											making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system
											to allow this.
											And I&#39;m very happy to report that we&#39;re now using a dose of radiation
											that is equivalent to the effective dose
											from one digital mammogram.
											And at this low dose, we&#39;re continuing this screening study,
											and this image from three weeks ago
											in a 67-year-old woman
											shows a normal digital mammogram,
											but an MBI image
											showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.
											So this is not just young women that it&#39;s benefiting.
											It&#39;s also older women with dense tissue.
											And we&#39;re now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose
											that&#39;s used in any other type of gamma technology.

											MBI generates four images per breast.
											MRI generates over a thousand.
											It takes a radiologist
											years of specialty training
											to become expert in differentiating
											the normal anatomic detail
											from the worrisome finding.
											But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room
											can find the tumor on the MBI image.
											But this is why MBI
											is so potentially disruptive —
											it&#39;s as accurate as MRI,
											it&#39;s far less complex to interpret,
											and it&#39;s a fraction of the cost.
											But you can understand why there may be
											forces in the breast-imaging world
											who prefer the status quo.

											After achieving what we felt were remarkable results,
											our manuscript was rejected
											by four journals.
											After the fourth rejection,
											we requested reconsideration of the manuscript,
											because we strongly suspected
											that one of the reviewers who had rejected it
											had a financial conflict of interest
											in a competing technology.
											Our manuscript was then accepted
											and will be published later this month
											in the journal Radiology.
											(Applause)
											We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,
											and then our findings will need to be replicated
											at other institutions,
											and this could take five or more years.
											If this technology is widely adopted,
											I will not benefit financially in any way,
											and that is very important to me,
											because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.
											But I recognize —
											(Applause)
											I recognize that the adoption of this technology
											will depend as much on economic
											and political forces
											as it will on the soundness of the science.

											The MBI unit has now been FDA approved,
											but it&#39;s not yet widely available.
											So until something is available
											for women with dense breasts,
											there are things that you should know
											to protect yourself.
											First, know your density.
											Ninety percent of women don&#39;t,
											and 95 percent of women don&#39;t know
											that it increases your breast cancer risk.
											The State of Connecticut became the first and only state
											to mandate that women receive notification
											of their breast density
											after a mammogram.
											I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging
											last week in Chicago,
											and I was stunned that there was a heated debate
											as to whether we should be telling women
											what their breast density is.
											Of course we should.
											And if you don&#39;t know, please ask your doctor
											or read the details of your mammography report.
											Second, if you&#39;re pre-menopausal,
											try to schedule your mammogram
											in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,
											when breast density is relatively lower.
											Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,
											insist on additional imaging.
											And fourth and most important,
											the mammography debate will rage on,
											but I do believe that all women 40 and older
											should have an annual mammogram.

											Mammography isn&#39;t perfect,
											but it&#39;s the only test that&#39;s been proven
											to reduce mortality from breast cancer.
											But this mortality banner
											is the very sword
											which mammography&#39;s most ardent advocates use
											to deter innovation.
											Some women who develop breast cancer
											die from it many years later,
											and most women, thankfully, survive.
											So it takes 10 or more years
											for any screening method
											to demonstrate a reduction
											in mortality from breast cancer.
											Mammography&#39;s the only one that&#39;s been around long enough
											to have a chance of making that claim.
											It is time for us to accept
											both the extraordinary successes of mammography
											and the limitations.
											We need to individualize screening
											based on density.
											For women without dense breasts,
											mammography is the best choice.
											But for women with dense breasts;
											we shouldn&#39;t abandon screening altogether,
											we need to offer them something better.

The director of the Mayo Clinic’s Executive Health Program is now testing a gamma camera that can see tumors that get missed by mammography.","whylisten":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For all of the lives it saves, mammography still cannot detect the early onset of breast cancer in as many as one of every four women ages 40 to 49. And women with dense breast tissue are four to six times more likely to develop cancer than others. Deborah Rhodes and her colleagues at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota think they&rsquo;ve found an effective way to screen these high-risk patients: molecular imaging. </p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rhodes, who specializes in evaluating and managing breast cancer, is collaborating with a nuclear physicist and various radiologists on a dual-head &ldquo;gamma camera&rdquo; that can capture the tiny tumors in dense tissue. The new technique, which would complement (not replace) mammography, is sensitive enough to pick up a mass two-ﬁfths of an inch in diameter. Molecular breast imaging requires patients to be injected with a radioactive drug, but it is much more comfortable than the vise-grip mammogram and is expected to cost only slightly more.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Deborah Rhodes","tags":["business","cancer","medicine","science","technology"],"title":"A test that finds 3x more breast tumors, and why it's not available to you","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":922134}]}
