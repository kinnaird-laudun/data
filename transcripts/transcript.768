											But in contrast to my evil twin

											my motives are not sinister.
											I control the brain
											in order to understand how it works.
											Now wait a minute, you may say,
											how can you go straight to controlling the brain
											without understanding it first?
											Isn&#39;t that putting the cart before the horse?
											Many neuroscientists agree with this view
											and think that understanding will come
											from more detailed observation and analysis.
											They say, &quot;If we could record the activity of our neurons,
											we would understand the brain.&quot;
											But think for a moment what that means.
											Even if we could measure
											what every cell is doing at all times,
											we would still have to make sense
											of the recorded activity patterns,
											and that&#39;s so difficult,

											Take a look at what brain activity might look like.
											In this simulation, each black dot
											is one nerve cell.
											The dot is visible
											whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse.
											There&#39;s 10,000 neurons here.
											So you&#39;re looking at roughly one percent
											of the brain of a cockroach.
											Your brains are about 100 million times
											more complicated.
											Somewhere, in a pattern like this,
											is you,
											your perceptions,
											your emotions, your memories,
											your plans for the future.
											But we don&#39;t know where,
											since we don&#39;t know how to read the pattern.
											We don&#39;t understand the code used by the brain.
											To make progress,
											we need to break the code.
											But how?
											An experienced code-breaker will tell you
											that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean,
											it&#39;s essential to be able to play with them,
											to rearrange them at will.
											So in this situation too,
											to decode the information
											contained in patterns like this,
											watching alone won&#39;t do.
											We need to rearrange the pattern.
											In other words,
											instead of recording the activity of neurons,
											we need to control it.
											It&#39;s not essential that we can control
											the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some.
											The more targeted our interventions, the better.
											And I&#39;ll show you in a moment
											how we can achieve the necessary precision.

											And since I&#39;m realistic, rather than grandiose,
											I don&#39;t claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system
											will at once unravel all its mysteries.
											But we&#39;ll certainly learn a lot.
											Now, I&#39;m by no means
											the first person to realize
											how powerful a tool intervention is.
											The history of attempts
											to tinker with the function of the nervous system
											is long and illustrious.
											It dates back at least 200 years,
											to Galvani&#39;s famous experiments
											in the late 18th century and beyond.
											Galvani showed that a frog&#39;s legs twitched
											when he connected the lumbar nerve
											to a source of electrical current.
											This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental,
											nugget of the neural code:
											that information is written in the form
											of electrical impulses.
											Galvani&#39;s approach
											of probing the nervous system with electrodes
											has remained state-of-the-art until today,
											despite a number of drawbacks.
											Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude.
											It&#39;s hard to do in animals that run around,
											and there is a physical limit
											to the number of wires
											that can be inserted simultaneously.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So around the turn of the last century,
											I started to think,
											&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if one could take this logic
											and turn it upside down?&quot;
											So instead of inserting a wire
											into one spot of the brain,
											re-engineer the brain itself
											so that some of its neural elements
											become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals
											such as a flash of light.
											Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light,
											overcome many of the obstacles to discovery.
											First, it&#39;s clearly a non-invasive,
											wireless form of communication.
											And second, just as in a radio broadcast,
											you can communicate with many receivers at once.
											You don&#39;t need to know where these receivers are,
											and it doesn&#39;t matter if these receivers move —
											just think of the stereo in your car.
											It gets even better,
											for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers
											out of materials that are encoded in DNA.
											So each nerve cell
											with the right genetic makeup
											will spontaneously produce a receiver
											that allows us to control its function.
											I hope you&#39;ll appreciate
											the beautiful simplicity
											of this concept.
											There&#39;s no high-tech gizmos here,
											just biology revealed through biology.

											Now let&#39;s take a look at these miraculous receivers up close.
											As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons,
											we see that its outer membrane
											is studded with microscopic pores.
											Pores like these conduct electrical current
											and are responsible
											for all the communication in the nervous system.
											But these pores here are special.
											They are coupled to light receptors
											similar to the ones in your eyes.
											Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor,
											the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on,
											and the neuron fires electrical impulses.
											Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA,
											we can achieve incredible precision.
											This is because,
											although each cell in our bodies
											contains the same set of genes,
											different mixes of genes get turned on and off
											in different cells.
											You can exploit this to make sure
											that only some neurons
											contain our light-activated pore and others don&#39;t.
											So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell
											in the upper-left corner
											does not respond to light
											because it lacks the light-activated pore.
											The approach works so well
											that we can write purely artificial messages
											directly to the brain.
											In this example, each electrical impulse,
											each deflection on the trace,
											is caused by a brief pulse of light.
											And the approach, of course, also works
											in moving, behaving animals.

											This is the first ever such experiment,
											sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani&#39;s.
											It was done six or seven years ago
											by my then graduate student, Susana Lima.
											Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left
											so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain
											expressed the light-activated pore.
											You&#39;re familiar with these cells
											because they are the ones that frustrate you
											when you try to swat the fly.
											They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air
											and fly away whenever you move your hand in position.
											And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.
											The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them,
											but it can&#39;t actually take off
											because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.
											Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly
											to a flash it could see,
											Susana did a simple
											but brutally effective experiment.
											She cut the heads off of her flies.
											These headless bodies can live for about a day,
											but they don&#39;t do much.
											They just stand around
											and groom excessively.
											So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity.
											(Laughter)
											Anyway, as you&#39;ll see in a moment,
											Susana was able to turn on the flight motor
											of what&#39;s the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies
											and get some of the headless bodies
											to actually take off and fly away.
											They didn&#39;t get very far, obviously.
											Since we took these first steps,
											the field of optogenetics has exploded.
											And there are now hundreds of labs
											using these approaches.

											And we&#39;ve come a long way
											since Galvani&#39;s and Susana&#39;s first successes
											in making animals twitch or jump.
											We can now actually interfere with their psychology
											in rather profound ways,
											as I&#39;ll show you in my last example,
											which is directed at a familiar question.
											Life is a string of choices
											creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next.
											We cope with this pressure by having brains,
											and within our brains, decision-making centers
											that I&#39;ve called here the &quot;Actor.&quot;
											The Actor implements a policy that takes into account
											the state of the environment
											and the context in which we operate.
											Our actions change the environment, or context,
											and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.

											Now to put some neurobiological meat
											on this abstract model,
											we constructed a simple one-dimensional world
											for our favorite subject, fruit flies.
											Each chamber in these two vertical stacks
											contains one fly.
											The left and the right halves of the chamber
											are filled with two different odors,
											and a security camera watches
											as the flies pace up and down between them.
											Here&#39;s some such CCTV footage.
											Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber
											where the two odor streams meet,
											it has to make a decision.
											It has to decide whether to turn around
											and stay in the same odor,
											or whether to cross the midline
											and try something new.
											These decisions are clearly a reflection
											of the Actor&#39;s policy.
											Now for an intelligent being like our fly,
											this policy is not written in stone
											but rather changes as the animal learns from experience.
											We can incorporate such an element
											of adaptive intelligence into our model
											by assuming that the fly&#39;s brain
											contains not only an Actor,
											but a different group of cells,
											a &quot;Critic,&quot; that provides a running commentary
											on the Actor&#39;s choices.
											You can think of this nagging inner voice
											as sort of the brain&#39;s equivalent
											of the Catholic Church,
											if you&#39;re an Austrian like me,
											or the super-ego, if you&#39;re Freudian,
											or your mother, if you&#39;re Jewish.

											Now obviously,
											the Critic is a key ingredient
											in what makes us intelligent.
											So we set out to identify
											the cells in the fly&#39;s brain
											that played the role of the Critic.
											And the logic of our experiment was simple.
											We thought if we could use our optical remote control
											to activate the cells of the Critic,
											we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor
											into changing its policy.
											In other words,
											the fly should learn from mistakes
											that it thought it had made
											but, in reality, it had not made.
											So we bred flies
											whose brains were more or less randomly peppered
											with cells that were light addressable.
											And then we took these flies
											and allowed them to make choices.
											And whenever they made one of the two choices,
											chose one odor,
											in this case the blue one over the orange one,
											we switched on the lights.
											If the Critic was among the optically activated cells,
											the result of this intervention
											should be a change in policy.
											The fly should learn to avoid
											the optically reinforced odor.

											Here&#39;s what happened in two instances:
											We&#39;re comparing two strains of flies,
											each of them having
											about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains,
											shown here in green on the left and on the right.
											What&#39;s common among these groups of cells
											is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine.
											But the identities of the individual
											dopamine-producing neurons
											are clearly largely different on the left and on the right.
											Optically activating
											these hundred or so cells
											into two strains of flies
											has dramatically different consequences.
											If you look first at the behavior
											of the fly on the right,
											you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber
											where the two odors meet,
											it marches straight through, as it did before.
											Its behavior is completely unchanged.
											But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.
											Whenever it comes up to the midpoint,
											it pauses,
											it carefully scans the odor interface
											as if it was sniffing out its environment,
											and then it turns around.
											This means that the policy that the Actor implements
											now includes an instruction to avoid the odor
											that&#39;s in the right half of the chamber.
											This means that the Critic
											must have spoken in that animal,
											and that the Critic must be contained
											among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left,
											but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Through many such experiments,
											we were able to narrow down
											the identity of the Critic
											to just 12 cells.
											These 12 cells, as shown here in green,
											send the output to a brain structure
											called the &quot;mushroom body,&quot;
											which is shown here in gray.
											We know from our formal model
											that the brain structure
											at the receiving end of the Critic&#39;s commentary is the Actor.
											So this anatomy suggests
											that the mushroom bodies have something to do
											with action choice.
											Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies,
											this makes perfect sense.
											In fact, it makes so much sense
											that we can construct an electronic toy circuit
											that simulates the behavior of the fly.
											In this electronic toy circuit,
											the mushroom body neurons are symbolized
											by the vertical bank of blue LEDs
											in the center of the board.
											These LED&#39;s are wired to sensors
											that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air.
											Each odor activates a different combination of sensors,
											which in turn activates
											a different odor detector in the mushroom body.
											So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly,
											the Actor,
											can tell which odor is present
											simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What the Actor does with this information
											depends on its policy,
											which is stored in the strengths of the connection,
											between the odor detectors
											and the motors
											that power the fly&#39;s evasive actions.
											If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off
											and the fly will continue straight on its course.
											If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on
											and the fly will initiate a turn.
											Now consider a situation
											in which the motors stay off,
											the fly continues on its path
											and it suffers some painful consequence
											such as getting zapped.
											In a situation like this,
											we would expect the Critic to speak up
											and to tell the Actor
											to change its policy.
											We have created such a situation, artificially,
											by turning on the critic with a flash of light.
											That caused a strengthening of the connections
											between the currently active odor detector
											and the motors.
											So the next time
											the fly finds itself facing the same odor again,
											the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors
											and to trigger an evasive maneuver.

											I don&#39;t know about you,
											but I find it exhilarating to see
											how vague psychological notions
											evaporate and give rise
											to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind,
											even if it&#39;s the mind of the fly.
											This is one piece of good news.
											The other piece of good news,
											for a scientist at least,
											is that much remains to be discovered.
											In the experiments I told you about,
											we have lifted the identity of the Critic,
											but we still have no idea
											how the Critic does its job.
											Come to think of it, knowing when you&#39;re wrong
											without a teacher, or your mother, telling you,
											is a very hard problem.
											There are some ideas in computer science
											and in artificial intelligence
											as to how this might be done,
											but we still haven&#39;t solved
											a single example
											of how intelligent behavior
											springs from the physical interactions
											in living matter.
											I think we&#39;ll get there in the not too distant future.

their approach to 'write directly to memory,' scientists [like Miesenboeck] can now obtain a level of evidence about brain function that was impossible before.","whotheyare":"Using light and a little genetic engineering -- optogenetics -- Gero Miesenboeck has developed a way to control how living nerve cells work, and advanced understanding of how the brain controls behavior.","whylisten":"<p>Gero Miesenboeck is pioneering the field of optogenetics: genetically modifying nerve cells to respond to light. By flashing light at a modified neuron in a living nervous system, Miesenboeck and his collaborators can mimic a brain impulse -- and then study what happens next. Optogenetics will allow ever more precise experiments on living brains, allowing us to gather better evidence on how electrical impulses on tissue translate into actual behavior and thoughts. </p><p>In one experiment, done at Yale, he and his team engineered fruit flies to be light-sensitive in the neural area responsible for escape response. Then the flies were beheaded; fruit flies can live for a day without their heads, but they don&#39;t move. When the modified cells were flashed with light, though, the headless flies flew. Miesenboeck had successfully simulated an order from a brain that wasn&#39;t even there anymore. </p><p>Miesenboeck&#39;s current research at Oxford&#39;s growing department of neurobiology focuses on the nerve cell networks that underpin what animals perceive, remember and do. In one recent experiment, he used optogenetics to implant an unpleasant memory in a fruit fly, causing it to &quot;remember&quot; to avoid a certain odor as it traveled around. He and his team were able, in fact, to find the fly&#39;s specific 12-neuron brain circuit that govern memory formation.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Gero Miesenboeck","tags":["biology","brain","science","neuroscience"],"title":"Re-engineering the brain","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":633240}]}
