									<p>
											Once upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.
											It was run by the great and powerful parents,
											and the people were helpless
											and hopeless naughty children.
											If any of the more rowdier children questioned
											the authority of the parents, they were scolded.
											If they went exploring into the parents&#39; rooms,
											or even into the secret filing cabinets, they were punished,
											and told that for their own good
											they must never go in there again.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Then one day, a man came to town
											with boxes and boxes of secret documents
											stolen from the parents&#39; rooms.
											&quot;Look what they&#39;ve been hiding from you,&quot; he said.
											The children looked and were amazed.
											There were maps and minutes from meetings
											where the parents were slagging each other off.
											They behaved just like the children.
											And they made mistakes, too, just like the children.
											The only difference was, their mistakes
											were in the secret filing cabinets.
											Well, there was a girl in the town, and she didn&#39;t think
											they should be in the secret filing cabinets,
											or if they were, there ought to be a law
											to allow the children access.
											And so she set about to make it so.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, I&#39;m the girl in that story, and the secret documents
											that I was interested in were located in this building,
											the British Parliament, and the data that I wanted
											to get my hands on were the expense receipts
											of members of Parliament.
											I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy. (Applause)
											It wasn&#39;t like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker,
											or anything like that, but the amount of resistance I got
											from this Freedom of Information request,
											you would have thought I&#39;d asked something like this.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I fought for about five years doing this,
											and it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made,
											not — I didn&#39;t — Hey, look, I didn&#39;t set out, honestly,
											to revolutionize the British Parliament.
											That was not my intention. I was just making these requests
											as part of research for my first book.
											But it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle
											and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament
											in front of three of Britain&#39;s most eminent High Court judges
											waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data.
											And I&#39;ve got to tell you, I wasn&#39;t that hopeful,
											because I&#39;d seen the establishment. I thought,
											it always sticks together. I am out of luck.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

											Well, guess what? I won. Hooray. (Applause)

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, that&#39;s not exactly the story, because the problem was
											that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data,
											and then they tried to retrospectively change the law
											so that it would no longer apply to them.
											The transparency law they&#39;d passed earlier that applied to everybody else,
											they tried to keep it so it didn&#39;t apply to them.
											What they hadn&#39;t counted on was digitization,
											because that meant that all those paper receipts
											had been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy
											for somebody to just copy that entire database,
											put it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament,
											which they did, and then they shopped that disk
											to the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph,
											and then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks
											of revelations, everything from porn movies
											and bath plugs and new kitchens
											and mortgages that had never been paid off.
											The end result was six ministers resigned,
											the first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign,
											a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency,
											120 MPs stepped down at that election,
											and so far, four MPs and two lords
											have done jail time for fraud.
											So, thank you. (Applause)

											Well, I tell you that story because it wasn&#39;t unique to Britain.
											It was an example of a culture clash that&#39;s happening

											So we are moving to this democratization of information,
											and I&#39;ve been in this field for quite a while.
											Slightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid,
											I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like,
											see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.
											I think that was a pretty good indication
											about my future career as an investigative journalist,
											and what I&#39;ve seen from being in this access to information field for so long
											is that it used to be quite a niche interest,
											and it&#39;s gone mainstream. Everybody, increasingly, around the world,
											wants to know about what people in power are doing.
											They want a say in decisions that are made in their name
											and with their money. It&#39;s this democratization of information
											that I think is an information enlightenment,
											and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment.
											It&#39;s about searching for the truth,
											not because somebody says it&#39;s true, &quot;because I say so.&quot;
											No, it&#39;s about trying to find the truth based on
											what you can see and what can be tested.
											That, in the first Enlightenment, led to questions about
											the right of kings, the divine right of kings to rule over people,
											or that women should be subordinate to men,
											or that the Church was the official word of God.

									<p>
											Obviously the Church weren&#39;t very happy about this,
											and they tried to suppress it,
											but what they hadn&#39;t counted on was technology,
											and then they had the printing press, which suddenly
											enabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast,
											and people would come together in coffee houses,
											discuss the ideas, plot revolution.

									<p>
											In our day, we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information,
											so now it&#39;s almost zero cost to copy and share information.
											Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks.
											We&#39;re moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system,
											and we have global decisions to make in this system,
											decisions about climate, about finance systems,
											about resources. And think about it —
											if we want to make an important decision about buying a house,
											we don&#39;t just go off. I mean, I don&#39;t know about you,
											but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it.
											And if we&#39;re thinking about a finance system,
											we need a lot of information to take in. It&#39;s just not possible
											for one person to take in the amount, the volume
											of information, and analyze it to make good decisions.

									<p>
											So that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing increasingly this demand
											for access to information.
											That&#39;s why we&#39;re starting to see more disclosure laws
											come out, so for example, on the environment,
											there&#39;s the Aarhus Convention,
											which is a European directive that gives people
											a very strong right to know, so if your water company
											is dumping water into your river, sewage water
											into your river, you have a right to know about it.
											In the finance industry, you now have more of a right
											to know about what&#39;s going on, so we have
											different anti-bribery laws, money regulations,
											increased corporate disclosure, so you can now track assets across borders.
											And it&#39;s getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance,
											pay inequality. So that&#39;s great. We&#39;re starting to find out
											more and more about these systems.

											And they&#39;re all moving to this central system,
											this fully connected system,
											all of them except one. Can you guess which one?
											It&#39;s the system which underpins all these other systems.
											It&#39;s the system by which we organize and exercise power,
											and there I&#39;m talking about politics, because in politics,
											we&#39;re back to this system, this top-down hierarchy.
											And how is it possible that the volume of information
											can be processed that needs to in this system?
											Well, it just can&#39;t. That&#39;s it.
											And I think this is largely what&#39;s behind the crisis
											of legitimacy in our different governments right now.

											So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He&#39;s a computer
											programmer, and he built a site called Alaveteli,
											and what it is, it&#39;s a Freedom of Information platform.
											It&#39;s open-source, with documentation, and it allows you
											to make a Freedom of Information request,
											to ask your public body a question, so
											it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you
											that there is a lot of hassle making these requests,
											so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question,
											for example, how many police officers have a criminal record?
											It zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you
											when the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all
											the correspondence, it posts it up there,
											and it becomes an archive of public knowledge.
											So that&#39;s open-source and it can be used in any country
											where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law.
											So there&#39;s a list there of the different countries that have it,
											and then there&#39;s a few more coming on board.
											So if any of you out there like the sound of that
											and have a law like that in your country,
											I know that Seb would love to hear from you
											about collaborating and getting that into your country.

											This is Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She&#39;s an Icelandic MP.
											And quite an unusual MP. In Iceland, she was
											one of the protesters who was outside of Parliament
											when the country&#39;s economy collapsed,
											and then she was elected on a reform mandate,
											and she&#39;s now spearheading this project.
											It&#39;s the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative,
											and they&#39;ve just got funding to make it an international
											modern media project, and this is taking all of the best laws
											around the world about freedom of expression,
											protection of whistleblowers, protection from libel,
											source protection, and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven.
											It&#39;s a place where your data can be free, so when we think
											about, increasingly, how governments want to access user data,
											what they&#39;re trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven
											where it can happen.

											In my own field of investigative journalism, we&#39;re also
											having to start thinking globally, so this is a site called
											Investigative Dashboard. And if you&#39;re trying to track
											a dictator&#39;s assets, for example, Hosni Mubarak,
											you know, he&#39;s just funneling out cash from his country
											when he knows he&#39;s in trouble, and what you want to do
											to investigate that is, you need to have access to
											all of the world&#39;s, as many as you can,
											companies&#39; house registrations databases.
											So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those
											databases into one place so you can start searching for,
											you know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services.
											You can try and find out how he&#39;s moving out assets
											from that country.

											But again, when it comes to the decisions which are
											impacting us the most, perhaps, the most important
											decisions that are being made about war and so forth,
											again we can&#39;t just make a Freedom of Information request.
											It&#39;s really difficult. So we&#39;re still having to rely on
											illegitimate ways of getting information, through leaks.
											So when the Guardian did this investigation about
											the Afghan War, you know, they can&#39;t walk into
											the Department of Defense and ask for all the information.
											You know, they&#39;re just not going to get it.
											So this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches
											that were written by American soldiers
											about the Afghan War, and leaked,
											and then they&#39;re able to do this investigation.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy.
											Again, this is all based around leaks,
											251,000 U.S. diplomatic cables, and I was involved
											in this investigation because I got this leak
											through a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker
											and ended up going to work at the Guardian.
											So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access
											to this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing.
											It reminded me of that scene in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;
											Do you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto
											runs across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back,
											the dog&#39;s pulling back the curtain, and —
											&quot;Don&#39;t look behind the screen. Don&#39;t look at the man behind the screen.&quot;
											It was just like that, because what you started to see
											is that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous
											politicians, they were just like us.
											They all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy,
											those cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important
											point for all of us to grasp, these are human beings
											just like us. They don&#39;t have special powers.
											They&#39;re not magic. They are not our parents.
											Beyond that, what I found most fascinating
											was the level of endemic corruption that I saw
											across all different countries, and particularly centered
											around the heart of power, around public officials
											who were embezzling the public&#39;s money
											for their own personal enrichment, and allowed to do that
											because of official secrecy.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I&#39;ve mentioned WikiLeaks, because surely what could be
											more open than publishing all the material?
											Because that is what Julian Assange did.
											He wasn&#39;t content with the way the newspapers published it
											to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there.
											That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan
											being exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator
											was given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners
											in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government.
											Is that radical openness? I say it&#39;s not, because for me,
											what it means, it doesn&#39;t mean abdicating power,
											responsibility, accountability, it&#39;s actually being a partner
											with power. It&#39;s about sharing responsibility,
											sharing accountability. Also, the fact that
											he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks,
											I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency
											in ideology, to be honest, as well. (Laughs)

									<p>
											The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive,
											and you must have two real qualities, I think,
											when you come to the table, when you&#39;re dealing
											with power, talking about power,
											because of its seductive capacity.
											You&#39;ve got to have skepticism and humility.
											Skepticism, because you must always be challenging.
											I want to see why do you — you just say so? That&#39;s not good enough.
											I want to see the evidence behind why that&#39;s so.
											And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes.
											And if you don&#39;t have skepticism and humility,
											then it&#39;s a really short journey to go from reformer
											to autocrat, and I think you only have to read &quot;Animal Farm&quot;
											to get that message about how power corrupts people.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what is the solution? It is, I believe, to embody
											within the rule of law rights to information.
											At the moment our rights are incredibly weak.
											In a lot of countries, we have Official Secrets Acts,
											including in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act
											with no public interest test. So that means it&#39;s a crime,
											people are punished, quite severely in a lot of cases,
											for publishing or giving away official information.
											Now wouldn&#39;t it be amazing, and really, this is what I want
											all of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act
											where officials were punished if they were found
											to have suppressed or hidden information
											that was in the public interest?
											So that — yes. Yes! My power pose. (Applause) (Laughs)
											I would like us to work towards that.

									<p>
											So it&#39;s not all bad news. I mean, there definitely is
											progress on the line, but I think what we find is that
											the closer that we get right into the heart of power,
											the more opaque, closed it becomes.
											So it was only just the other week that I heard London&#39;s
											Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why
											the police need access to all of our communications,
											spying on us without any judicial oversight,
											and he said it was a matter of life and death.
											He actually said that, it was a matter of life and death.
											There was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that.
											It was just, &quot;Because I say so.
											You have to trust me. Take it on faith.&quot;
											Well, I&#39;m sorry, people, but we are back
											to the pre-Enlightenment Church,
											and we need to fight against that.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So he was talking about the law in Britain which is
											the Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.
											In America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.
											You&#39;ve got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance.
											You have the National Security Agency building
											the world&#39;s giantest spy center. It&#39;s just this colossal —
											it&#39;s five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol,
											in which they&#39;re going to intercept and analyze
											communications, traffic and personal data

											Well, to go back to our original story, the parents
											have panicked. They&#39;ve locked all the doors.
											They&#39;ve kitted out the house with CCTV cameras.
											They&#39;re watching all of us. They&#39;ve dug a basement,
											and they&#39;ve built a spy center to try and run algorithms
											and figure out which ones of us are troublesome,
											and if any of us complain about that, we&#39;re arrested for terrorism.
											Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?
											Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don&#39;t.
											I think we&#39;ve all read the Grimms&#39; fairy tales, which are,
											indeed, very grim.
											But the world isn&#39;t a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal
											than we want to acknowledge.
											Equally, it could be better than we&#39;ve been led to believe,
											but either way, we have to start seeing it exactly as it is,
											with all of its problems, because it&#39;s only by seeing it
											with all of its problems that we&#39;ll be able to fix them
											and live in a world in which we can all be
											happily ever after. (Laughs) Thank you very much.
											(Applause)
											Thank you. (Applause)

In 2005, she filed one of the very first requests under the UK&#39;s Freedom of Information Act, asking to see the expense reports of Members of Parliament. The request was blocked, modified and refiled, and blocked again...but the years-long quest to view expense documents, and the subsequent investigation, led to 2009&#39;s parliamentary expenses scandal. The scandal led to the first forced resignation of the Speaker of the House in 300 years.</p>  <p>Brooke worked as a political and crime reporter in the US before moving to Britain, where she writes for the national papers. She has published three books:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://heatherbrooke.org/books/your-right-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Y<em>our Right to Know</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://heatherbrooke.org/books/silent-state\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Silent State</em></a>, and 2011&#39;s<em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.therevolutionwillbedigitised.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Revolution Will Be Digitised</a></em>.
