											This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.
											What looks like moss covering rocks
											is actually a shrub
											comprised of thousands of branches,
											each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end
											and so densely packed together
											that you could actually stand on top of it.
											This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile,
											and it happens to be 3,000 years old.
											It also happens to be a relative of parsley.

											For the past five years, I&#39;ve been researching,
											working with biologists
											and traveling all over the world
											to find continuously living organisms
											that are 2,000 years old and older.
											The project is part art and part science.
											There&#39;s an environmental component.
											And I&#39;m also trying to create a means
											in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time
											and to start to consider a deeper timescale.
											I selected 2,000 years as my minimum age
											because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero
											and work backward from there.

											What you&#39;re looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi,
											living on the remote island of Yakushima.
											The tree was in part a catalyst for the project.
											I&#39;d been traveling in Japan
											without an agenda other than to photograph,
											and then I heard about this tree
											that is 2,180 years old
											and knew that I had to go visit it.
											It wasn&#39;t until later, when I was actually back home in New York
											that I got the idea for the project.
											So it was the slow churn, if you will.
											I think it was my longstanding desire
											to bring together my interest
											in art, science and philosophy
											that allowed me to be ready
											when the proverbial light bulb went on.
											So I started researching, and to my surprise,
											this project had never been done before
											in the arts or the sciences.
											And — perhaps naively —
											I was surprised to find that there isn&#39;t even an area in the sciences
											that deals with this idea
											of global species longevity.

											So what you&#39;re looking at here
											is the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen,
											and this is around 3,000 years old
											and lives in Greenland,
											which is a long way to go for some lichens.
											Visiting Greenland was more like
											traveling back in time
											than just traveling very far north.
											It was very primal and more remote
											than anything I&#39;d ever experienced before.
											And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences.
											One was when I had been dropped off by boat
											on a remote fjord,
											only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet
											were nowhere to be found.
											And it&#39;s not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail,
											so I was literally left to my own devices.
											But luckily, it worked out obviously,
											but it was a humbling experience
											to feel so disconnected.
											And then a few days later,
											we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream
											near our campsite,
											where the fish were so abundant
											that you could literally reach into the stream
											and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands.
											It was like visiting
											a more innocent time on the planet.
											And then, of course, there&#39;s the lichens.
											These lichens grow only one centimeter
											every hundred years.
											I think that really puts human lifespans
											into a different perspective.

											And what you&#39;re looking at here
											is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon.
											And if the title &quot;Searching for Armillaria Death Rings,&quot;
											sounds ominous, it is.
											The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus,
											killing certain species of trees in the forest.
											It&#39;s also more benignly known
											as the honey mushroom or the &quot;humongous fungus&quot;
											because it happens to be
											one of the world&#39;s largest organisms as well.
											So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus,
											I got some maps and some GPS coordinates
											and chartered a plane
											and started looking for the death rings,
											the circular patterns
											in which the fungus kills the trees.
											So I&#39;m not sure if there are any in this photo,
											but I do know the fungus is down there.
											And then this back down on the ground
											and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.
											So that white material that you see
											in between the bark and the wood
											is the mycelial felt of the fungus,
											and what it&#39;s doing — it&#39;s actually
											slowly strangling the tree to death
											by preventing the flow of water and nutrients.
											So this strategy has served it pretty well —
											it&#39;s 2,400 years old.
											And then from underground to underwater.

											This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago
											that&#39;s around 2,000 years old.
											And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.
											This is at about 60 feet
											or 18 meters, depth.
											And you&#39;ll see, there&#39;s some damage to the surface of the coral.
											That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish
											that had started eating it,
											though luckily, they lost interest before killing it.
											Luckily still, it seems to be out of harm&#39;s way
											of the recent oil spill.
											But that being said, we just as easily could have lost
											one of the oldest living things on the planet,
											and the full impact of that disaster
											is still yet to be seen.

											Now this is something that I think
											is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.
											This is clonal colony
											of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah,
											that is literally 80,000 years old.
											What looks like a forest
											is actually only one tree.
											Imagine that it&#39;s one giant root system
											and each tree is a stem
											coming up from that system.
											So what you have is one giant,
											interconnected,
											genetically identical individual
											that&#39;s been living for 80,000 years.
											It also happens to be male
											and, in theory immortal.

											This is a clonal tree as well.
											This is the spruce Gran Picea,
											which at 9,550 years
											is a mere babe in the woods.
											The location of this tree
											is actually kept secret for its own protection.
											I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree,
											and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center
											is most likely a product of climate change.
											As it&#39;s gotten warmer on the top of the mountain,
											the vegetation zone is actually changing.
											So we don&#39;t even necessarily have to have
											direct contact with these organisms
											to have a very real impact on them.

											This is the Fortingall Yew —
											no, I&#39;m just kidding —
											this is the Fortingall Yew.
											(Laughter)
											But I put that slide in there
											because I&#39;m often asked if there are any animals in the project.
											And aside from coral,
											the answer is no.
											Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is —
											any guesses?
											(Audience: 300.)
											Rachel Sussman: 300? No, 175
											is the oldest living tortoise,
											so nowhere near 2,000.
											And then, you might have heard
											of this giant clam that was discovered
											off the coast of northern Iceland
											that reached 405 years old.
											However, it died in the lab
											as they were determining its age.
											The most interesting discovery of late, I think
											is the so-called immortal jellyfish,
											which has actually been observed in the lab
											to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state
											after reaching full maturity.
											So that being said,
											it&#39;s highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.
											And back to the yew here.
											So as you can see, it&#39;s in a churchyard;
											it&#39;s in Scotland. It&#39;s behind a protective wall.
											And there are actually a number or ancient yews
											in churchyards around the U.K.,
											but if you do the math, you&#39;ll remember
											it&#39;s actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches.

											And now down to another part of the world.
											I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa
											with an expert in Baobab trees.
											And we saw a number of them,
											and this is most likely the oldest.
											It&#39;s around 2,000,
											and it&#39;s called the Sagole Baobab.
											And you know, I think of all of these organisms
											as palimpsests.
											They contain thousands of years
											of their own histories within themselves,
											and they also contain records of natural and human events.
											And the Baobabs in particular
											are a great example of this.
											You can see that this one
											has names carved into its trunk,
											but it also records some natural events.
											So the Baobabs, as they get older,
											tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.
											And this can create
											great natural shelters for animals,
											but they&#39;ve also been appropriated
											for some rather dubious human uses,
											including a bar, a prison
											and even a toilet inside of a tree.

											And this brings me to another favorite of mine —
											I think, because it is just so unusual.
											This plant is called the Welwitschia,
											and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola,
											where it&#39;s uniquely adapted
											to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.
											And what&#39;s more, it&#39;s actually a tree.
											It&#39;s a primitive conifer.
											You&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s bearing cones down the center.
											And what looks like two big heaps of leaves,
											is actually two single leaves
											that get shredded up
											by the harsh desert conditions over time.
											And it actually never sheds those leaves,
											so it also bears the distinction
											of having the longest leaves
											in the plant kingdom.
											I spoke to a biologist
											at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown
											to ask him
											where he thought this remarkable plant came from,
											and his thought was that
											if you travel around Namibia,
											you see that there are a number of petrified forests,
											and the logs are all —
											the logs are all giant coniferous trees,
											and yet there&#39;s no sign of where they might have come from.
											So his thought was that
											flooding in the north of Africa
											actually brought those coniferous trees down
											tens of thousands of years ago,
											and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation
											to this unique desert environment.

											This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things.
											This is something called an underground forest.
											So, I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden,
											who explained that certain species of trees
											have adapted to this region.
											It&#39;s bushfelt region,
											which is dry and prone to a lot of fires,
											as so what these trees have done
											is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree,
											and that this is ground level,
											imagine that the whole thing,
											that whole bulk of the tree,
											migrated underground,
											and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface.
											That way, when a fire roars through,
											it&#39;s the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.
											The tree can easily recover.
											These also tend to grow clonally,
											the oldest of which is 13,000 years old.

											Back in the U.S., there&#39;s a couple plants of similar age.
											This is the clonal Creosote bush,
											which is around 12,000 years old.
											If you&#39;ve been in the American West,
											you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous,
											but that being said, you see that this has
											this unique, circular form.
											And what&#39;s happening is it&#39;s expanding slowly outwards
											from that original shape.
											And it&#39;s one — again, that interconnected root system,
											making it one genetically identical individual.
											It also has a friend nearby —
											well, I think they&#39;re friends.
											This is the clonal Mojave yucca, it&#39;s about a mile away,
											and it&#39;s a little bit older than 12,000 years.
											And you see it has that similar circular form.
											And there&#39;s some younger clones
											dotting the landscape behind it.
											And both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush,
											live on Bureau of Land Management land,
											and that&#39;s very different from being protected in a national park.
											In fact, this land is designated
											for recreational all-terrain vehicle use.

											So, now I want to show what very well might be
											the oldest living thing on the planet.
											This is Siberian Actinobacteria,
											which is between 400,000
											and 600,000 years old.
											This bacteria was discovered several years ago
											by a team of planetary biologists
											hoping to find clues to life on other planets
											by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours.
											And what they found, by doing research into the permafrost,
											was this bacteria.
											But what&#39;s unique about it is that
											it&#39;s doing DNA repair below freezing.
											And what that means is that it&#39;s not dormant —
											it&#39;s actually been living and growing
											for half a million years.
											It&#39;s also probably one the most vulnerable
											of the oldest living things,
											because if the permafrost melts,
											it won&#39;t survive.

											This is a map that I&#39;ve put together of the oldest living things,
											so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they&#39;re all over the world.
											The blue flags represent things that I&#39;ve already photographed,
											and the reds are places that I&#39;m still trying to get to.
											You&#39;ll see also, there&#39;s a flag on Antarctica.
											I&#39;m trying to travel there
											to find 5,000 year-old moss,
											which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula.

									<p>
											So, I probably have about two more years left
											on this project —
											on this phase of the project,
											but after five years,
											I really feel like I know what&#39;s at the heart of this work.
											The oldest living things in the world
											are a record and celebration of our past,
											a call to action in the present
											and a barometer of our future.
											They&#39;ve survived for millennia
											in desert, in the permafrost,
											at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean.
											They&#39;ve withstood
											untold natural perils and human encroachments,
											but now some of them are in jeopardy,
											and they can&#39;t just get up and get out of the way.
											It&#39;s my hope that, by going to find these organisms,
											that I can help draw attention
											to their remarkable resilience
											and help play a part in insuring
											their continued longevity into the foreseeable future.
