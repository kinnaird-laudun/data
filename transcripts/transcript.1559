<title>Rodrigo Canales: The deadly genius of drug cartels | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Up to 100,000 people died in drug-related violence in Mexico in the last 6 years. We might think this has nothing to do with us, but in fact we are all complicit, says Yale professor Rodrigo Canales in this unflinching talk that turns conventional wisdom about drug cartels on its head. The carnage is not about faceless, ignorant goons mindlessly killing each other but is rather the result of some seriously sophisticated brand management." />

<meta content='Up to 100,000 people died in drug-related violence in Mexico in the last 6 years. We might think this has nothing to do with us, but in fact we are all complicit, says Yale professor Rodrigo Canales in this unflinching talk that turns conventional wisdom about drug cartels on its head. The carnage is not about faceless, ignorant goons mindlessly killing each other but is rather the result of some seriously sophisticated brand management.' itemprop='description'>

											In December of 2010,
											the city of Apatzingán
											in the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,
											awoke to gunfire.
											For two straight days,
											the city became an open battlefield
											between the federal forces
											and a well-organized group,
											presumably from the local criminal organization,
											La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.
											The citizens didn&#39;t only experience incessant gunfire
											but also explosions
											and burning trucks used as barricades across the city,
											so truly like a battlefield.
											After these two days,
											and during a particularly intense encounter,
											it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,
											Nazario Moreno, was killed.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In response to this terrifying violence,
											the mayor of Apatzingán
											decided to call the citizens to a march for peace.
											The idea was to ask for a softer approach
											to criminal activity in the state.
											And so, the day of the scheduled procession,
											thousands of people showed up.
											As the mayor was preparing to deliver
											the speech starting the march,
											his team noticed
											that, while half of the participants
											were appropriately dressed in white,
											and bearing banners asking for peace,
											the other half was actually marching
											in support of the criminal organization
											and its now-presumed-defunct leader.
											Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside
											rather than participate or lead a procession
											that was ostensibly in support of organized crime.
											And so his team stepped aside.
											The two marches joined together,
											and they continued their path
											towards the state capital.

											This story of horrific violence
											followed by a fumbled approach
											by federal and local authorities as they tried
											to engage civil society,
											who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,
											is a perfect metaphor for what&#39;s happening in Mexico today,
											where we see that our current understanding
											of drug violence and what leads to it
											is probably at the very least incomplete.

											If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying
											to figure out what&#39;s going on with drug violence in Mexico
											by, say, just researching online,
											the first thing you would find out is that
											while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,
											there are some that are more
											and there are some that are much less equal than others,
											because you will quickly find out
											that in the past six years
											anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people
											have lost their lives in drug-related violence.
											To put these numbers in perspective,
											this is eight times larger than the number of casualties
											in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
											It&#39;s also shockingly close to the number of people
											who have died in the Syrian civil war,
											which is an active civil war.
											This is happening just south of the border.

											Now as you&#39;re reading, however,
											you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly
											become numb to the numbers of deaths,
											because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers
											of faceless, nameless dead people.
											Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative
											that all the people who are dying
											were somehow involved in the drug trade,
											and we infer this because they were either tortured
											or executed in a professional manner,
											or, most likely, both.
											And so clearly they were criminals
											because of the way they died.
											And so the narrative is that somehow these people
											got what they were deserved.
											They were part of the bad guys.
											And that creates some form of comfort
											for a lot of people.

											However, while it&#39;s easier to think
											of us, the citizens, the police, the army,
											as the good guys, and them, the narcos,
											the carteles, as the bad guys,
											if you think about it,
											the latter are only providing a service to the former.
											Whether we like it or not,
											the U.S. is the largest market
											for illegal substances in the world,
											accounting for more than half of global demand.
											It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico

											The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users
											of illegal drugs in the United States.
											Using very, very conservative assumptions,
											this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side
											of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.
											If we assume that the narcos only have access
											to the wholesale part, which we know is false,
											that still leaves you with yearly revenues
											of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.
											To put these numbers in perspective,
											Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.
											And it so happens that this is a product that,
											because of its nature, a business model
											to address this market requires you
											to guarantee to your producers
											that their product will be reliably placed
											in the markets where it is consumed.
											And the only way to do this, because it&#39;s illegal,
											is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors
											that are used to transport drugs.
											Hence the violence.
											If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,
											you will see that it almost perfectly aligns
											with the most efficient routes of transportation
											from the south to the north.
											The only thing that the cartels are doing
											is that they&#39;re trying to protect their business.

											It&#39;s not only a multi-billion dollar market,
											but it&#39;s also a complex one.
											For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant
											that can only grow in certain latitudes,
											and so it means that a business model
											to address this market requires you to have
											decentralized, international production,
											that by the way needs to have good quality control,
											because people need a good high
											that is not going to kill them
											and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.
											And so that means they need to secure
											production and quality control in the south,
											and you need to ensure that you have
											efficient and effective distribution channels
											in the markets where these drugs are consumed.
											I urge you, but only a little bit,
											because I don&#39;t want to get you in trouble,
											to just ask around and see how difficult it would be
											to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,
											whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,
											and some of you may be surprised to know
											that there are many dealers that offer a service
											where if you send them a text message,
											they guarantee delivery of the drug
											in 30 minutes or less.

											Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,
											an effective organization requires
											an integrated strategy that includes
											a good organizational structure, good incentives,
											a solid identity and good brand management.
											This leads me to the second thing that you would learn
											in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.
											Because you would quickly realize,
											and maybe be confused by the fact,
											that there are three organizations
											that are constantly named in the articles.
											You will hear about Los Zetas,
											the Knights Templar, which is the new brand
											for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,
											and the Sinaloa Federation.
											You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment
											of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter
											and they silence the press,
											and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.
											But this is the result of a very careful branding
											and business strategy.
											You see, Los Zetas is not just
											this random assortment of individuals,
											but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,
											that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.
											When that corridor became contested, they decided
											that they wanted to recruit
											a professional enforcement arm.
											So they recruited Los Zetas:
											an entire unit of elite paratroopers
											from the Mexican Army.
											They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,
											so much so that at some point, they decided
											to just take over the operations,
											which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,
											because they grow up.
											Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason,
											they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution
											in the most profitable markets like cocaine,
											but what they did have,
											and this is again based on their military origin,
											was a perfectly structured chain of command
											with a very clear hierarchy
											and a very clear promotion path that allowed them
											to supervise and operate across many, many markets
											very effectively,
											which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.
											And so because they didn&#39;t have access
											to the more profitable drug markets,
											this pushed them and gave them the opportunity
											to diversify into other forms of crime.
											That includes kidnapping, prostitution,
											local drug dealing and human trafficking,
											including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.
											So what they currently run is truly
											and quite literally a franchise business.
											They focus most of their recruiting on the army,
											and they very openly advertise for better salaries,
											better benefits, better promotion paths,
											not to mention much better food,
											than what the army can deliver.
											The way they operate is that
											when they arrive in a locality,
											they let people know that they are there,
											and they go to the most powerful local gang
											and they say, &quot;I offer you
											to be the local representative of the Zeta brand.&quot;
											If they agree — and you don&#39;t want to know
											what happens if they don&#39;t —
											they train them and they supervise them
											on how to run the most efficient criminal operation
											for that town, in exchange for royalties.
											This kind of business model obviously depends
											entirely on having a very effective brand of fear,
											and so Los Zetas
											carefully stage acts of violence
											that are spectacular in nature,
											especially when they arrive first in a city,
											but again, that&#39;s just a brand strategy.
											I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re not violent,
											but what I am saying is that even though you will read
											that they are the most violent of all,
											when you count, when you do the body count,
											they&#39;re actually all the same.

									<p>
											In contrast to them, the Knights Templar
											that arose in Michoacán
											emerged in reaction to the incursion
											of the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.
											Michoacán is a geographically strategic state
											because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,
											and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,
											which then gives you direct access to the U.S.
											The Knights Templar realized very quickly
											that they couldn&#39;t face the Zetas on violence alone,
											and so they developed a strategy
											as a social enterprise.
											They brand themselves as representative of
											and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán
											against organized crime.
											Their brand of social enterprise means
											that they require a lot of civic engagement,
											so they invest heavily in providing local services,
											like dealing with home violence,
											going after petty criminals, treating addicts,
											and keeping drugs out of the local markets
											where they are,
											and, of course, protecting people
											from other criminal organizations.
											Now, they kill a lot of people too,
											but when they kill them,
											they provide very careful narratives and descriptions
											for why they did them,
											through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,
											and billboards that explain that the people who were killed
											were killed because they represented a threat
											not to us, as an organization, of course,
											but to you, as citizens.
											And so we&#39;re actually here to protect you.
											They, as social enterprises do,
											have created a moral and ethical code
											that they advertise around,
											and they have very strict recruiting practices.
											And here you have the types of explanations
											that they provide for some of their actions.
											They have actually retained access
											to the profitable drug trade,
											but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,
											and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,
											they leverage that to, for example,
											trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created
											and legally extracted
											with illegal ephedrine from China
											which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines
											that they produce, and then they have partnerships
											with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation
											that place their products in the U.S.

									<p>
											Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.
											When you read about them, you will often read about them
											with an undertone of reverence and admiration,
											because they are the most integrated
											and the largest of all the Mexican organizations,
											and, many people argue, the world.
											They started as just sort of a transport organization
											that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.
											and the Mexican borders,
											but now they have grown
											into a truly integrated multinational
											that has partnerships in production in the south
											and partnerships in global distribution
											across the planet.
											They have cultivated a brand of professionalism,
											business acumen and innovation.
											They have designed new drug products
											and new drug processes.
											They have designed narco-tunnels
											that go across the border,
											and you can see that these are not
											&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; types.
											They have invented narco-submarines and boats
											that are not detected by radar.
											They have invented drones to transport drugs,
											catapults, you name it.
											One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation
											actually made it to the Forbes list.

											Like any multinational would, they have specialized
											and focused only in the most profitable part of the business,
											which is high-margin drugs like cocaine,
											heroine, methamphetamines.
											Like any traditional Latin American multinational would,
											the way they control their operations
											is through family ties.
											When they&#39;re entering a new market, they send
											a family member to supervise it,
											or, if they&#39;re partnering with a new organization,
											they create a family tie,
											either through marriages or other types of ties.
											Like any other multinational would,
											they protect their brand by outsourcing
											the more questionable parts of the business model,
											like for example, when they have to engage
											in violence against other criminal organizations,
											they recruit gangs and other smaller players
											to do the dirty work for them,
											and they try to separate their operations
											and their violence and be very discrete about this.

											And so, differences aside,
											what these three organizations share
											is on the one hand, a very clear understanding
											that institutions cannot be imposed from the top,
											but rather they are built from the bottom up
											one interaction at a time.
											They have created extremely coherent structures
											that they use to show the inconsistencies
											in government policies.

											And so what I want you to remember from this talk
											are three things.
											The first one is that drug violence
											is actually the result
											of a huge market demand
											and an institutional setup that forces
											the servicing of this market to necessitate violence
											to guarantee delivery routes.
											The second thing I want you to remember
											is that these are sophisticated,
											coherent organizations
											that are business organizations,
											and analyzing them and treating them as such
											is probably a much more useful approach.
											The third thing I want you to remember
											is that even though we&#39;re more comfortable
											with this idea of &quot;them,&quot;
											a set of bad guys separated from us,
											we are actually accomplices to them,
											either through our direct consumption
											or through our acceptance of the inconsistency
											between our policies of prohibition
											and our actual behavior of tolerance
											or even encouragement of consumption.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											These organizations service, recruit from,
											and operate within our communities,
											so necessarily, they are much more integrated
											within them than we are comfortable acknowledging.
											And so to me the question is not whether
											these dynamics will continue the way they have.
											We see that the nature of this phenomenon
											guarantees that they will.
											The question is whether we are willing to continue
											our support of a failed strategy
											based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance
											at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.
