<title>Jude Kelly: Why women should tell the stories of humanity | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For many centuries (and for many reasons) critically acclaimed creative genius has generally come from a male perspective. As theater director Jude Kelly points out in this passionately reasoned talk, that skew affects how we interpret even non-fictional women&#39;s stories and rights. She thinks there&#39;s a more useful, more inclusive way to look at the world, and she calls on artists -- women and men -- to paint, draw, write about, film and imagine a gender-equal society." />

<meta content="For many centuries (and for many reasons) critically acclaimed creative genius has generally come from a male perspective. As theater director Jude Kelly points out in this passionately reasoned talk, that skew affects how we interpret even non-fictional women's stories and rights. She thinks there's a more useful, more inclusive way to look at the world, and she calls on artists — women and men — to paint, draw, write about, film and imagine a gender-equal society." itemprop='description'>

											So I started a festival called WOW,
Women of the World, seven years ago,
											and it&#39;s now in 20 countries
across five continents.
											And one of those countries
is Somaliland in Africa.
											So I traveled there last year,
											and part of the joy I had in going there
was going to these caves.
											The Laas Geel caves.
											Now, these caves contain some
of the oldest cave paintings in the world.
											These paintings are thought to be
round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old.
											Art:
											what humanity has done
ever since it evolved.
											It&#39;s how we speak about ourselves,
											how we understand our identity,
											how we look at our surroundings,
											who we find out about each other
											because of the meaning of our lives.
											That&#39;s what art is for.

											So look at this little picture.

when I was a little girl.
											And I thought, well, who painted
this joyful, youthful figure?

absolutely askance, and he said,

											Now, I wasn&#39;t really surprised,
											because that&#39;s an attitude
that I&#39;ve seen continuously
											all my life as a theater maker.
											We are told that divine knowledge
comes down through the masculine,
											whether it be to the imam,
the priest, the rabbi, the holy man.
											Similarly, we&#39;re told that creative genius
resides in the masculine,
											that it is the masculine
											that will be able to tell us
about who we really are,
											that the masculine will tell
the universal story
											on behalf of all of us,
											whereas women artists will really
just talk about women&#39;s experiences,
											women&#39;s issues
only really relevant to women
											and of passing interest to men —
											and really only some men.
											And it&#39;s that conviction,
											that that we are taught,
											that I think colors so much
of whether we&#39;re prepared to believe
											that women&#39;s stories really matter.
											And unless we&#39;re prepared to believe

											So I took my two children
when they were little —
											Caroline was eight and Robby was five —
											to see &quot;E.T.&quot;
											And it&#39;s a fantastic story
of this little alien
											who ends up in an American family
											with a mum, two brothers and a sister,
											but he wants to go home.
											Not only that, but some
really bad scientists
											want to do some experiments on him,
											and they&#39;re looking for him.
											So the children have a plot.
											They decide they&#39;re going to take him
back to his spaceship
											as soon as they can,
											and they plop him in a bicycle basket,
											and off they ride.
											But unfortunately, the baddies
have found out, and they&#39;re catching up
											and they&#39;ve got sirens
and they&#39;ve got their guns,
											they&#39;ve got the loud-hailers,
it&#39;s terribly frightening,
											and they&#39;re closing up on the children,
											and the children are never
going to make it.
											And then all of a sudden, magically,
the bikes fly up in the air,
											over the clouds,
											over the moon,
											and they&#39;re going to save &quot;E.T.&quot;

he&#39;s there with them, he&#39;s saving E.T.,

											And I turn to Caroline,
and she&#39;s crying her eyes out.
											And I said, &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;
											And she said, &quot;Why can&#39;t I save E.T.?
Why can&#39;t I come?&quot;
											And then all of a sudden I realized:
											they weren&#39;t children;
											they were boys —
											all boys.
											And Caroline, who had invested
so much in E.T.,

of what he intended with E.T.,

and embrace difference.&quot;

											And this is common.
											Men feel they have been given the mantle
for universal communication,

											They are writing from male experience
through male&#39;s eyes.
											We have to have a look at this ourselves.
											We have to be prepared to go back

											all our favorite things,
											and say, &quot;Actually, this is written
by a male artist —
											not an artist.
											We have to see
that so many of these stories

											Let me talk about &quot;Hamlet.&quot;

											That is the question.
											But it&#39;s not my question.
											My question is: Why was I taught
as a young woman
											that this was the quintessential
example of human dilemma
											and human experience?
											It&#39;s a marvelous story,
											but actually, it&#39;s about a young man
fearful that he won&#39;t be able to make it
											as a powerful figure in a male world
											unless he takes revenge
for his father&#39;s murder.
											He talks a great deal to us
about suicide being an option,
											but the reality is that the person
who actually commits suicide, Ophelia,
											after she&#39;s been humiliated
and abused by him,
											never gets a chance to talk
to the audience about her feelings.
											And then when he&#39;s finished with Ophelia,
he turns on his mum,
											because basically she has the audacity
to fall in love with his uncle
											and enjoy sex.

											It is a great story,
											but it is a story about male conflict,
male dilemma, male struggle.
											But I was told this was the story
of human beings,
											despite the fact that it only
had two women in it.
											And unless I reeducate myself,
											I am always going to think
											that women&#39;s stories
matter less than men&#39;s.
											A woman could have written &quot;Hamlet,&quot;
											but she would have written it differently,
											and it wouldn&#39;t have had
global recognition.
											As the writer Margaret Atwood says,
											&quot;When a man writes about doing the dishes,
											it&#39;s realism.
											When a woman writes about doing it,

to be a theater director,

directors in Britain,&quot; he said, &quot;Jude.&quot;

											Now, leaving aside
the disgusting slur on gay women,
											the fact is, he wanted to humiliate me.
											He thought it was silly
that I wanted to be a director.
											And I told my friend Marin Alsop,
the conductor, and she said,
											&quot;Oh yes, well, my music teacher
said exactly the same.
											He said, &#39;Women don&#39;t conduct.&#39;&quot;
											But all these years later,
we&#39;ve made our mark.
