											There was a time in my life

											Everywhere I went, I felt at home.

											This is where it began.
											And it raises an existential question,
											which is, if I&#39;m having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,
											why am I not visible in the photograph,
											and where is this time and place?
											This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.
											This is a police photo. That&#39;s actually my car.
											We&#39;re less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,
											called Cedars-Sinai.
											And the situation is that a car full of paramedics
											on their way home from the hospital after work
											have run across the wreckage,
											and they&#39;ve advised the police
											that there were no survivors inside the car,
											that the driver&#39;s dead, that I&#39;m dead.
											And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive
											to cut apart the vehicle
											to extract the body of the driver.
											And when they do, they find that behind the glass,
											they find me.
											And my skull&#39;s crushed and my collar bone is crushed;
											all but two of my ribs,
											my pelvis and both arms —
											they&#39;re all crushed, but there is still a pulse.
											And they get me to that nearby hospital,
											Cedars-Sinai,
											where that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,
											45 units of blood —
											which means full replacements of all the blood in me —
											before they&#39;re able to staunch the flow.
											I&#39;m put on full life support,
											and I have a massive stroke,
											and my brain drops into a coma.

											Now comas are measured
											on a scale from 15 down to three.
											Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.
											And if you look, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s only one way you can score three.
											It&#39;s essentially there&#39;s no sign of life
											from outside at all.
											I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,
											and it is inside that deepest level of coma,
											on the rim between my life and my death,
											that I&#39;m experiencing the full connection and full consciousness
											of inner space.

											From my family looking in from outside,
											what they&#39;re trying to figure out
											is a different kind of existential question,
											which is, how far is it going to be possible to bridge
											from the comatose potential mind that they&#39;re looking at
											to an actual mind,
											which I define simply
											as the functioning of the brain
											that is remaining inside my head.
											Now to put this into a broader context,
											I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien
											watching the Earth from outer space,
											and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television
											is the Earth channel,
											and your favorite show is the Human Show.
											And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you
											is because consciousness is so interesting.
											It&#39;s so unpredictable
											and so fragile.

											And this is how we began.
											We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.
											The show began with tremendous special effects,
											because there were catastrophic climate shifts —
											which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.
											Because of the Earth tilting on its axis
											and those catastrophic climate shifts,
											we had to figure out how to find better food,
											and we had to learn — there&#39;s Lucy; that&#39;s how we all began —
											we had to learn how to crack open animal bones,
											use tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,
											to grow our brains more.
											So we actually grew our consciousness
											in response to this global threat.

											Now you also continue to watch
											as consciousness evolved to the point
											that here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,
											there&#39;s one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.
											It&#39;s a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,
											and it&#39;s the first known expression of art
											on the planet.
											And the reason it connects us with consciousness today
											is that all of us still today,
											the very first shape we draw as a child
											is a circle.
											And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.
											We create an eye —
											and the eye that evolves through all of our history.
											There&#39;s the Egyptian god Horus,
											which symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.
											And that comes down right way to the present
											with the dollar bill in the United States,
											which has on it an eye of providence.

											So watching all of this show from outer space,
											you think we get it, we understand
											that the most precious resource on the blue planet
											is our consciousness.
											Because it&#39;s the first thing we draw;
											we surround ourselves with images of it;
											it&#39;s probably the most common image on the planet.
											But we don&#39;t. We take our consciousness for granted.
											While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.
											Until it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.
											And what I&#39;ve learned since that event
											and during my recovery
											is that consciousness is under threat on this planet
											in ways it&#39;s never been under threat before.
											These are just some examples.

											And the reason I&#39;m so honored to be here

											And here are some of the other categories, if you look at the whole planet.
											The World Health Organization tells us
											that depression is the number one disease on Earth
											in terms of years lived with disability.
											We find that the number two source of disability
											is depression in the age group
											of 15 to 44.
											Our children are becoming depressed
											at an alarming rate.
											I discovered during my recovery
											the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers
											is suicide.
											If you look at some of these other items — concussions.
											Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents
											are for concussions.
											If I talk about migraine,

											Fifteen percent suffer migraines

											And that then might lead you
											to watch an episode one day
											of Cedars-Sinai medical center
											and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.
											This is a dense array EEG MRI
											tracking 156 channels of information.
											It&#39;s not my EEG at Cedars;
											it&#39;s your EEG tonight and last night.
											It&#39;s the what our minds do every night

											and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we&#39;re asleep
											to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning.
											This is how I was when I returned from the hospital
											after nearly four months.
											The horseshoe shape you can see on my skull
											is where they operated and went inside my brain
											to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.
											But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,
											I&#39;m looking down,
											but let me tell you how I felt at that point.
											I didn&#39;t feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.
											I felt empty and full, hot and cold,
											euphoric and depressed
											because the brain is the world&#39;s first
											fully functional quantum computer;
											it can occupy multiple states at the same time.
											And with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged,

											But let&#39;s swivel around and look at me frontally.
											This is now flash-forward to the point in time

											Look into those eyes. I&#39;m not able to focus those eyes.
											I&#39;m not able to follow a line of text in a book.
											But the system has moved me on
											because, as my family started to discover,

											But let&#39;s take a look behind my eyes.
											This is a gamma radiation spec scan
											that uses gamma radiation
											to map three-dimensional function within the brain.
											It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension,
											but in two dimensions I think you can see
											the beautiful symmetry and illumination
											of a normal mind at work.
											Here&#39;s my brain.
											That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain
											being destroyed by the stroke.
											So my family, as we moved forward
											and discovered that the health care system had moved us by,
											had to try to find solutions and answers.
											And during that process — it took many years —
											one of the doctors said that my recovery, my degree of advance,
											since the amount of head injury I&#39;d suffered,
											was miraculous.
											And that was when I started to write a book,

											So from this experience of my recovery,
											I want to share four particular aspects —
											I call them the four C&#39;s of consciousness —
											that helped me grow my potential mind
											back towards the actual mind that I work with every day.
											The first C is cognitive training.
											Unlike the smashed glass of my car,
											plasticity of the brain
											means that there was always a possibility, with treatment,
											to train the brain
											so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness.
											Plasticity means that there was always
											hope for our reason —
											hope for our ability to rebuild that function.
											Indeed, the mind can redefine itself,
											and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva
											back in the 1970&#39;s.
											The global perspective
											is that up to 30 percent of children in school
											have learning weaknesses
											that are not self-correcting,
											but with appropriate treatment,
											they can be screened for and detected and corrected
											and avoid their academic failure.
											But what I discovered is it&#39;s almost impossible to find anyone
											who provides that treatment or care.

											Here&#39;s what my neuropsychologist provided for me
											when I actually found somebody who could apply it.
											I&#39;m not a doctor, so I&#39;m not going to talk about the various subtests.
											Let&#39;s just talk about full-scale I.Q.
											Full-scale I.Q. is the mental processing —
											how fast you can acquire information,
											retain it and retrieve it —
											that is essential for success in life today.
											And you can see here there are three columns.
											Untestable — that&#39;s when I&#39;m in my coma.
											And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79,
											which is just below average.
											In the health care system, if you touch average, you&#39;re done.
											That&#39;s when I was discharged from the system.
											What does average I.Q. really mean?
											It meant that when I was given two and a half hours
											to take a test that anyone here
											would take in 50 minutes,
											I might score an F.
											This is a very, very low level
											in order to be kicked out of the health care system.
											Then I underwent cognitive training.
											And let me show you what happened to the right-hand column
											when I did my cognitive training over a period of time.
											This is not supposed to occur.
											I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify
											at the age of eight.

											Now the Journal of the National Medical Association

											that there was important, valuable information in the book,

											The answer is yes, and for the first time,
											it&#39;s my pleasure to be able to share two examples.
											Here&#39;s somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training
											at ages seven and 11.
											And here&#39;s another person in, call it, high school and college.
											And this person is particularly interesting.
											I won&#39;t go into the intrascatter that&#39;s in the subtests,

											Second aspect:
											I still had crushing migraine headaches.
											Two elements that worked for me here
											are — the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain
											is through muscular-skeletal imbalance.
											The craniomandibular system is critical to that.
											And when I underwent it and found solutions,
											this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.
											Up to 30 percent of the population
											have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw
											that affects the entire body.
											I was fortunate to find a dentist
											who applied this entire universe
											of technology you&#39;re about to see
											to establish that if he repositioned my jaw,
											the headaches pretty much resolved,
											but that then my teeth weren&#39;t in the right place.
											He then held my jaw in the right position
											while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.
											So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.
											This affected my entire body.

											If that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say
											and rather a bold statement —
											How can the jaw affect the entire body? —
											let me simply point out to you,
											if I ask you tomorrow
											to put one grain of sand between your teeth
											and go for a nice long walk,
											how far would you last
											before you had to remove that grain of sand?
											That tiny misalignment.
											Bear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.
											That&#39;s why the same between the before and after that this shows,
											it&#39;s hard to see the difference.
											Now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth
											and see the difference it makes.
											I still had migraine headaches.

											The next issue that resolved
											was that, if 90 percent of head and neck pain
											is caused by imbalance,
											the other 10 percent, largely —
											if you set aside aneurysms, brain cancer
											and hormonal issues —
											is the circulation.
											Imagine the blood flowing through your body —
											I was told at UCLA Medical Center —
											as one sealed system.
											There&#39;s a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,
											and around that pipe are the nerves
											drawing their nutrient supply from the blood.
											That&#39;s basically it.
											If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,
											it bulges someplace else.
											If that some place else where it bulges
											is inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,
											you get a vascular migraine.
											This is a level of pain that&#39;s only known
											to other people who suffer vascular migraines.
											Using this technology,
											this is mapping in three dimensions.
											This is an MRI MRA MRV,
											a volumetric MRI.
											Using this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center
											were able to identify
											where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.
											A vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body.
											And in the following months and years,
											I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning.

											Communication, the next C. This is critical.

											And here, by great fortune,

											I&#39;ve brought with me, from Southern California,
											the FM device.

											Where does it go inside the body?
											It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free
											for over 80 years.
											So it goes in and it stays there.
											Here are the implantation sites.
											The concept that they&#39;re working towards — and they have working prototypes —
											is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body
											where they&#39;re needed.
											The main unit will then go inside the brain.
											An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,
											will send signals in real time
											to the motor points in the relevant muscles
											so that the person will be able to move their arm, let&#39;s say, in real time,
											if they&#39;ve lost control of their arm.
											And other FM devices implanted in fingertips,
											on contacting a surface,
											will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain,
											so that the person feels a sense of touch.
											Is this science fiction? No,
											because I&#39;m wearing the first application of this technology.

											And in closing, I want to share
											the personal reason why this meant so much to me
											and changed the direction of my life.
											In my coma, one of the presences I sensed
											was someone I felt was a protector.
											And when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family,
											but I didn&#39;t remember my own past.
											Gradually, I remembered the protector was my wife.
											And I whispered the good news
											through my broken jaw, which was wired shut,
											to my night nurse.
											And the following morning, my mother came to explain
											that I&#39;d not always been in this bed, in this room,
											that I&#39;d been working in film and television
											and that I had been in a crash
											and that, yes, I was married,
											but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash.
											And during my time in coma,
											she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.
											Now in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for me
											if everything that made today special was gone.
											And as I discovered these threats to consciousness
											and how they are surrounding the world
											and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day,
											I discovered what truly remained.
											I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness,
											that the Human Show can stay on the air
											for millennia to come.
											I believe that we can all rise and shine.

After earning law degrees from Christ&#39;s College Cambridge and Boalt Hall, Berkeley, Lewis moved to Los Angeles, where his Hollywood experience includes managing writers, directors and stars, as well as producing <em>Look Who&#39;s Talking,</em> critically acclaimed films such as <em>The Chocolate War</em>, the Emmy-winning international co-production for HBO and ITV Central <em>A Month of Sundays (Age Old Friends)</em>, and variety specials starring Howie Mandel.&nbsp;</p><p>He&#39;s the author of <a href=\"http://www.riseandshinethebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rise and Shine</em></a>, a memoir that uses his personal story -- of recovery from coma -- to illustrate deep and universal insights about consciousness itself. An acclaimed author, speaker and commentator, Lewis uses creative visualizations that fuse cutting-edge medicine, scientific research and digital art to illustrate solutions to society&rsquo;s most pressing problem: the erosion of consciousness and need for solutions to nurture and grow our minds through cognitive and other therapies.</p><p>An advocate for change in how we educate our children and ourselves, he says that we must not take our consciousness for granted, but use specific tools to screen and detect learning weaknesses and prevent academic failure. Bridge the gap from our potential mind toward our actual mind and maximize consciousness itself across our population, from child to adult.<br /><br /><em><a href=\"http://atavist.net/blindsight/\" target=\"_blank\">The Atavist</a></em> magazine devoted Issue No. 7 to Chris Colin&#39;s in-depth biographical profile of Lewis, called &quot;Blindsight.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/books/la-et-book-20110913,0,7143546.story\" target=\"_blank\">Read a review</a> or <a href=\"http://atavist.net/blindsight/\" target=\"_blank\">buy the issue</a>.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Simon Lewis","tags":["consciousness","medicine","technology"],"title":"Don't take consciousness for granted","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":716726}]}
