											As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories
											about the future,
											and where we might move forward from this point.
											Some of those stories are that
											somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.
											Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.

									<p>
											But I want to tell you a different story here today.
											Like all stories, it has a beginning.
											My work, for a long time, has been involved in education,
											in teaching people practical skills
											for sustainability,
											teaching people how to take responsibility
											for growing some of their own food,
											how to build buildings using local materials,
											how to generate their own energy, and so on.

											I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland,
											and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.
											But all my work for many years was focused
											around the idea that sustainability
											means basically looking at
											the globalized economic growth model,
											and moderating what comes in at one end,
											and moderating the outputs at the other end.
											And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things
											which actually changed that profoundly.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And in order to introduce you to that,
											I&#39;ve got something here that I&#39;m going to unveil,
											which is one of the great marvels of the modern age.
											And it&#39;s something so astounding and so astonishing
											that I think maybe as I remove this cloth
											a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.
											If you could help me with that it would be fantastic.
											(Laughter)
											This is a liter of oil.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This bottle of oil,
											distilled over a hundred million years of geological time,
											ancient sunlight,
											contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks
											hard human manual labor —
											equivalent to about 35 strong people
											coming round and working for you.
											We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,
											medicine, modern clothing,
											laptops, a whole range of different things.
											It gives us an energy return that&#39;s unimaginable, historically.
											We&#39;ve based the design of our settlements,
											our business models, our transport plans,
											even the idea of economic growth, some would argue,
											on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Yet, when we take a step back,
											and look over the span of history,
											at what we might call the petroleum interval,
											it&#39;s a short period in history
											where we&#39;ve discovered this extraordinary material,
											and then based a whole way of life around it.
											But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,
											we move from a time where our economic success,
											our sense of individual prowess and well-being
											is directly linked to how much of this we consume,
											to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency
											is our degree of vulnerability.

									<p>
											And it&#39;s increasingly clear that we
											aren&#39;t going to be able to rely on the fact that
											we&#39;re going to have this at our disposal forever.
											For every four barrels of oil that we consume,
											we only discover one.
											And that gap continues to widen.
											There is also the fact that the amount of energy
											that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.
											In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back
											for every one that we put in to extract it.
											Completely unprecedented, historically.
											Already that&#39;s fallen to about 11.
											And that&#39;s why, now,
											the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers
											in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,
											or at the bottom of the oceans.

											There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.
											But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.
											The moment when the world on average passes this peak,
											people wonder when that&#39;s going to happen.
											And there is an emerging case
											that maybe that was what happened last July
											when the oil prices were so high.

											But are we to assume that the same brilliance
											and creativity and adaptability
											that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place
											is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate
											when we have to design a creative way back down the other side?
											No. But the thinking that we have to come up with
											has to be based on a realistic assessment

											But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,
											is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,
											as the data that&#39;s coming in,
											which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.
											So the IPCC said
											that we might see significant breakup
											of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.
											Actually, if current trends continue,
											it could all be gone in five or 10 years&#39; time.
											If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost
											is released as the world warms,
											it would offset all the savings that we need to make,
											in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.
											We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.

											And this is really about looking the challenges

											Transitional is completely different.
											Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,

											It learns very much from its mistakes.
											And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense

											And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience
											is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.
											The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.
											And it&#39;s really about how systems,
											settlements, withstand shock from the outside.
											When they encounter shock from the outside
											that they don&#39;t just unravel and fall to pieces.

											When our supermarkets have only two or three days&#39; worth of food in them
											at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on
											the energy efficiency of the freezers
											and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.
											Looking through the lens of resilience,
											we really question how we&#39;ve let ourselves get into a situation
											that&#39;s so vulnerable.
											Resilience runs much deeper:
											it&#39;s about building modularity into what we do,
											building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.

											This is a photograph of the Bristol and District

											This is at a time when the city of Bristol,
											which is quite close to here,
											was surrounded by commercial market gardens,
											which provided a significant amount of the food
											that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.
											There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,

											So how does this transition idea work?
											So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.
											They pick up some of the tools that we&#39;ve developed.
											They start to run an awareness-raising program
											looking at how this might actually work in the town.
											They show films, they give talks, and so on.
											It&#39;s a process which is playful and creative
											and informative.
											Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,
											and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects
											which then the transition project itself
											starts to support and enable.

											So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland,
											where I was teaching, and has since spread.
											There are now over 200 formal transition projects.
											And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.
											They are mulling whether they&#39;re going to take it further.
											And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.
											But what do they actually do? You know, it&#39;s a kind of nice idea,

											Well, I think it&#39;s really important to make the point that actually
											you know, this isn&#39;t something which is going to do everything on its own.
											We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.
											We need national responses. We need local government responses.
											But all of those things are going to be much easier
											if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas
											and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,
											over the next 5 to 10 years.

											Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects,
											like community-supported agriculture schemes,
											urban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.
											A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,
											community-owned energy companies,
											where the community can invest money into itself,
											to start putting in place
											the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.
											A lot of places are working with their local schools.
											Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;
											the kids are learning how to grow food.
											Promoting recycling, things like garden-share,
											that matches up people who don&#39;t have a garden
											who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren&#39;t using anymore.
											Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
											And also starting to play around with the idea of
											alternative currencies.

											This is Lewes in Sussex,

											Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan,
											which is basically to develop a plan B for the town.
											Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan
											for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,
											still start by assuming that there will be more energy,
											more cars, more housing,
											more jobs, more growth, and so on.
											What does it look like if that&#39;s not the case? And how can we embrace that
											and actually come up with something that was actually more likely
											to sustain everybody?
											As a friend of mine says, &quot;Life is a series of things you&#39;re not quite ready for.&quot;
											And that&#39;s certainly been my experience with transition.
											From three years ago, it just being an idea,
											this has become something that has virally swept around the world.
											We&#39;re getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,
											the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference
											as a keynote listener.
											Which he did —

											And the head of the council said,

											In Scotland, the Scottish government&#39;s climate change fund
											has funded Transition Scotland
											as a national organization supporting the spread of this.
											And we see it all over the place as well now.

											I think I&#39;d like to just return at the end
											to the idea of stories.
											Because I think stories are vital here.
											And actually the stories that we tell ourselves,
											we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.
											And one of the key things that transition does
											is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
											Stories about the community that&#39;s produced
											its own 21 pound note, for example,
											the school that&#39;s turned its car park into a food garden,
											the community that&#39;s founded its own energy company.
											And for me, one of the great stories recently
											was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House
											to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,
											when Eleanor Roosevelt did it,
											it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.

											So the question I&#39;d like to leave you with, really,

											Personally, I feel enormously grateful
											to have lived through the age of cheap oil.
											I&#39;ve been astonishingly lucky, we&#39;ve been astonishingly lucky.
											But let us honor what it has bought us,
											and move forward from this point.
											Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume
											that it can underpin our choices,
											the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.
											And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,
											and that the Oil Age has done for us,
											we are able to then begin the creation
											of a world which is more resilient,
											more nourishing,
											and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled
											and more connected to each other.
											Thank you very much.

radically hopeful and community-driven approach to creating societies independent of fossil fuel. ","whylisten":"<p>Rob Hopkins leads a vibrant new movement of towns and cities that utilize <strong>local cooperation and interdependence to shrink their ecological footprints</strong>. In the face of climate change he developed the concept of Transition Initiatives -- communities that produce their own goods and services, curb the need for transportation and take other measures to prepare for a post-oil future. While Transition shares certain principles with greenness and sustainability, it is a deeper vision concerned with re-imagining our future in a self-sufficient way and building resiliency. <br /><br />Transforming theory to action, Hopkins is also the co-founder and a resident of the first Transition Initiative in the UK, in Totnes, Devon. As he refuses to fly, it is from his home in Totnes that he offers help to hundreds of similar communities that have sprung up around the world, in part through his blog, <a href=\"http://transitionculture.org/\" target=\"_blank\">transitionculture.org</a>.<br /><br />Hopkins, who&#39;s trained in ecological design, wrote the principal work on the subject,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/transitionhandbook\" target=\"_blank\">Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resilience</a>,</em>&nbsp;a 12-step manual for a postcarbon future.
