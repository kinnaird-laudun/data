											I&#39;m a cancer doctor, and I walked out of my office
											and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago,
											and this was the cover of Fortune magazine
											sitting in the window of the pharmacy.
									</p>

									<p>
											And so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this,
											and you get a little bit downhearted.
											But when you start to read the article by Cliff,
											who himself is a cancer survivor,
											who was saved by a clinical trial
											where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York
											to get an experimental therapy for —
											at the time — Hodgkin&#39;s disease, which saved his life,
											he makes remarkable points here.
											And the point of the article was that we have gotten
											reductionist in our view of biology,
											in our view of cancer.
											For the last 50 years, we have focused on treating
											the individual gene
											in understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, this is an astounding table.
											And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday
											in that, obviously, we&#39;ve made remarkable impacts
											on cardiovascular disease,
											but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer
											in over 50 years hasn&#39;t changed.
											We&#39;ve made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia,
											where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission,
											but in general, we haven&#39;t made an impact at all in the war on cancer.

											So, what I&#39;m going to tell you today,
											is a little bit of why I think that&#39;s the case,
											and then go out of my comfort zone
											and tell you where I think it&#39;s going,
											where a new approach — that we hope to push forward
											in terms of treating cancer.
											Because this is wrong.

									<p>
											So, what is cancer, first of all?
											Well, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor,
											they stick a needle in.
											They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition:
											Does it look normal? Does it look abnormal?
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle.
											This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell.
											That is the state-of-the-art today in diagnosing cancer.
											There&#39;s no molecular test,
											there&#39;s no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday,
											there&#39;s no fancy looking at the chromosomes.
											This is the state-of-the-art and how we do it.

									<p>
											You know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can&#39;t treat advanced cancer.
											So, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.
											It is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early.
											We can prevent most cancers.
											You know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease.
											We could do the same in cancer.
											I co-founded a company called Navigenics,
											where, if you spit into a tube —
											and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease,
											all of which are delayable in many of the cancers —
											you start to identify what you could get,
											and then we can start to work to prevent them.
											Because the problem is, when you have advanced cancer,
											we can&#39;t do that much today about it, as the statistics allude to.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, the thing about cancer is that it&#39;s a disease of the aged.
											Why is it a disease of the aged?
											Because evolution doesn&#39;t care about us after we&#39;ve had our children.
											See, evolution protected us during our childbearing years
											and then, after age 35 or 40 or 45,
											it said &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore, because they&#39;ve had their progeny.&quot;
											So if you look at cancers, it is very rare — extremely rare —
											to have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year.
											As one gets older? Very, very common.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Why is it hard to treat?
											Because it&#39;s heterogeneous,
											and that&#39;s the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.
											It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells,
											what we call clonal selection.
											But, if we start to understand
											that cancer isn&#39;t just a molecular defect, it&#39;s something more,
											then we&#39;ll get to new ways of treating it, as I&#39;ll show you.

											So, one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer
											is that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms:
											&quot;I&#39;m tired, I&#39;m bloated, I have pain, etc.&quot;
											You then have some anatomic descriptions,
											you get that CT scan: &quot;There&#39;s a three centimeter mass in the liver.&quot;
											You then have some body part descriptions:
											&quot;It&#39;s in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate.&quot;
											And that&#39;s about it.
											So, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor.
											It&#39;s basically symptoms.
											It&#39;s manifestations of a disease.

											What&#39;s exciting is that over the last two or three years,
											the government has spent 400 million dollars,
											and they&#39;ve allocated another billion dollars,
											to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.
											So, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer,
											and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.
											You know, in the mid-1850&#39;s in France,
											they started to describe cancer by body part.
											That hasn&#39;t changed in over 150 years.
											It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer
											by prostate, by breast, by muscle.
											It makes no sense, if you think about it.

											So, obviously, the technology is here today,
											and, over the next several years, that will change.
											You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic.
											You will go to a HER2 amplified clinic, or an EGFR activated clinic,
											and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions
											that were involved in causing this individual cancer.
											So, hopefully, we will go from being the art of medicine
											more to the science of medicine,
											and be able to do what they do in infectious disease,
											which is look at that organism, that bacteria,
											and then say, &quot;This antibiotic makes sense,
											because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it.&quot;
											When one is exposed to H1N1, you take Tamiflu,
											and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms
											and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease.
											Why? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it —
											although we can&#39;t make vaccine in this country, but that&#39;s a different story.

											So, the website of the National Cancer Institute
											says that cancer is a genetic disease.
											The website says, &quot;If you look, there&#39;s an individual mutation,
											and maybe a second, and maybe a third,
											and that is cancer.&quot;
											But, as a cancer doc, this is what I see.
											This isn&#39;t a genetic disease.
											So, there you see, it&#39;s a liver with colon cancer in it,
											and you see into the microscope a lymph node
											where cancer has invaded.
											You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver.
											Cancer is an interaction of a cell
											that no longer is under growth control with the environment.
											It&#39;s not in the abstract; it&#39;s the interaction with the environment.
											It&#39;s what we call a system.

											And so, if you think of cancer as a system,
											there&#39;s an input and an output and a state in the middle.
											So, the states, are equivalent classes of history,
											and the cancer patient, the input, is the environment,
											the diet, the treatment, the genetic mutations.
											The output are our symptoms:
											Do we have pain? Is the cancer growing? Do we feel bloated, etc.?
											Most of that state is hidden.
											So what we do in our field is we change and input,
											we give aggressive chemotherapy,

											And so, the problem is that it&#39;s not just one system,

											It&#39;s a system of systems.
											And so, when you start to look at emergent systems,
											you can look at a neuron under a microscope.
											A neuron under the microscope is very elegant

											and that brain can create intelligence,
											what we&#39;re talking about in the body,
											and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.
											Well, the bad news is that these robust —
											and robust is a key word —

											So, just for two seconds, how these technologies work —
											because I think it&#39;s important to understand it.
											What happens is every protein in your body is charged,
											so the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around,
											and then there&#39;s a detector at the end.
											When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge.
											And so we can accurately — if the magnet is big enough,
											and your resolution is high enough —
											you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body

											So, to conclude, we need to get away from reductionist thinking.
											We need to start to think differently and radically.
											And so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas.
											Tell them to me or anyone else in our field,
											because over the last 59 years, nothing has changed.
											We need a radically different approach.

											You know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel —
											and Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual.
											When Andy stepped down, he said,
											&quot;No technology will win. Technology itself will win.&quot;
											And I&#39;m a firm believer, in the field of medicine and especially cancer,
											that it&#39;s going to be a broad platform of technologies
											that will help us move forward
											and hopefully help patients in the near-term.
