											The story begins in the late &#39;90s.
											I was invited to meet with leading educators
											from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.
											They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities.
											Since education under the Soviet Union
											was essentially propaganda
											serving the purposes of a state ideology,
											they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations
											if they were to provide an education
											worthy of free men and women.
											Given this rare opportunity
											to start fresh,
											they chose liberal arts
											as the most compelling model
											because of its historic commitment
											to furthering its students&#39; broadest intellectual,
											and deepest ethical potential.

									<p>
											Having made that decision
											they came to the United States,
											home of liberal arts education,
											to talk with some of us
											most closely identified
											with that kind of education.
											They spoke with a passion, an urgency,
											an intellectual conviction
											that, for me, was a voice I had not heard in decades,
											a dream long forgotten.
											For, in truth, we had moved light years
											from the passions that animated them.
											But for me, unlike them,
											in my world, the slate was not clean,
											and what was written on it was not encouraging.

											In truth, liberal arts education
											no longer exists —
											at least genuine liberal arts education — in this country.
											We have professionalized liberal arts to the point
											where they no longer provide the breadth of application
											and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement
											that is their signature.
											Over the past century
											the expert has dethroned the educated generalist
											to become the sole model
											of intellectual accomplishment. (Applause)

											Expertise has for sure had its moments.
											But the price of its dominance is enormous.
											Subject matters are broken up
											into smaller and smaller pieces,
											with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure.
											We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane.
											You may think you know what is going on

											The progression of today&#39;s college student
											is to jettison every interest except one.
											And within that one, to continually narrow the focus,
											learning more and more about less and less;
											this, despite the evidence all around us
											of the interconnectedness of things.
											Lest you think I exaggerate,
											here are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology.
											As one moves up the ladder,
											values other than technical competence
											are viewed with increasing suspicion.
											Questions such as,
											&quot;What kind of a world are we making?
											What kind of a world should we be making?
											What kind of a world can we be making?&quot;
											are treated with more and more skepticism,
											and move off the table.

											In so doing, the guardians of secular democracy
											in effect yield the connection
											between education and values
											to fundamentalists,
											who, you can be sure,
											have no compunctions about using education
											to further their values:
											the absolutes of a theocracy.
											Meanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent.
											Either we have lost touch with those values
											or, no better,
											believe they need not
											or cannot be taught.
											This aversion to social values
											may seem at odds with the explosion
											of community service programs.
											But despite the attention paid to these efforts,
											they remain emphatically extracurricular.
											In effect, civic-mindedness is treated
											as outside the realm of what purports to be
											serious thinking and adult purposes.
											Simply put, when the impulse is to change the world,
											the academy is more likely to engender
											a learned helplessness
											than to create a sense of empowerment.

											This brew — oversimplification of civic engagement,
											idealization of the expert,
											fragmentation of knowledge,
											emphasis on technical mastery,
											neutrality as a condition of academic integrity —
											is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections
											between education and the public good,
											between intellectual integrity
											and human freedom,
											which were at the heart —
											(Applause) — of the challenge posed to and by
											my European colleagues.
											When the astronomical distance
											between the realities of the academy
											and the visionary intensity of this challenge

											Whether it was threats to the environment,
											inequities in the distribution of wealth,
											lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy
											with respect to the continuing uses of energy,
											we were in desperate straits.
											And that was only the beginning.
											The corrupting of our political life
											had become a living nightmare;
											nothing was exempt —
											separation of powers, civil liberties,
											the rule of law,
											the relationship of church and state.
											Accompanied by a squandering
											of the nation&#39;s material wealth
											that defied credulity.
											A harrowing predilection for the uses of force
											had become commonplace,
											with an equal distaste
											for the alternative forms of influence.
											At the same time, all of our firepower was impotent
											when it came to halting or even stemming
											the slaughter in Rwanda, Darfur, Myanmar.

											Our public education, once a model for the world,

											Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy
											eludes vast numbers of our students.
											Despite having a research establishment

											Incredibly, this nation,
											with all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources,
											seems utterly helpless
											to reverse the freefall in any of these areas.
											Equally startling, from my point of view,
											is the fact that no one
											was drawing any connections

											We may be at the top of the list

											On a more personal note,

											As president of a leading liberal arts college,
											famous for its innovative history,
											there were no excuses.
											So the conversation began at Bennington.
											Knowing that if we were to regain
											the integrity of liberal education,
											it would take radical rethinking
											of basic assumptions,
											beginning with our priorities.
											Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.
											The accomplishment of civic virtue
											is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination

											Our ways of approaching agency and authority
											turn inside out to reflect the reality
											that no one has the answers
											to the challenges facing citizens in this century,
											and everyone has the responsibility
											for trying and participating in finding them.
											Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences

											in personal and professional objectives.
											But the balances redressed,
											our shared purposes assume an equal

											When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.
											The idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves —
											from health and education
											to the uses of force —
											the organizers of the curriculum.
											They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines.
											But structures designed to connect, rather than divide
											mutually dependent circles,
											rather than isolating triangles.
											And the point is not to treat these topics
											as topics of study,
											but as frameworks of action.
											The challenge: to figure out what it will take
											to actually do something
											that makes a significant and sustainable difference.

											Contrary to widely held assumptions,
											an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking.
											The importance of coming to grips with values like justice,
											equity, truth,
											becomes increasingly evident
											as students discover that interest alone
											cannot tell them what they need to know
											when the issue is rethinking education,
											our approach to health,
											or strategies for achieving
											an economics of equity.
											The value of the past also comes alive;
											it provides a lot of company.
											You are not the first to try to figure this out,
											just as you are unlikely to be the last.
											Even more valuable,
											history provides a laboratory
											in which we see played out
											the actual, as well as the intended
											consequences of ideas.

											In the language of my students,
											&quot;Deep thought matters
											when you&#39;re contemplating what to do
											about things that matter.&quot;
											A new liberal arts that can support this
											action-oriented curriculum
											has begun to emerge.
											Rhetoric, the art of organizing the world of words
											to maximum effect.
											Design, the art of organizing the world of things.
											Mediation and improvisation
											also assume a special place in this new pantheon.
											Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position
											at the heart of what it takes to manage change
											where measurement is crucial.
											As is a capacity to discriminate
											systematically between what is at the core
											and what is at the periphery.

											And when making connections is of the essence,
											the power of technology emerges with special intensity.
											But so does the importance of content.
											The more powerful our reach,
											the more important the question &quot;About what?&quot;
											When improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key,
											artists, at long last,
											take their place at the table,
											when strategies of action are in the process of being designed.
											In this dramatically expanded ideal
											of a liberal arts education
											where the continuum of thought and action is its life&#39;s blood,
											knowledge honed outside the academy
											becomes essential.
											Social activists, business leaders,
											lawyers, politicians, professionals
											will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants
											in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.
											Students, in turn, continuously move outside the classroom
											to engage the world directly.

									<p>
											And of course, this new wine
											needs new bottles
											if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism
											of this idea.
											The most important discovery we made
											in our focus on public action
											was to appreciate that the hard choices
											are not between good and evil,
											but between competing goods.
											This discovery is transforming.
											It undercuts self-righteousness,
											radically alters the tone and character of controversy,
											and enriches dramatically
											the possibilities for finding common ground.
											Ideology, zealotry,
											unsubstantiated opinions simply won&#39;t do.
											This is a political education, to be sure.
											But it is a politics of principle,
											not of partisanship.
											So the challenge for Bennington is to do it.

											So we are doing our job.

											the deterioration of our infrastructure

											We the people

											People will continue and should continue

											the multiplicity of perspectives,
											the capacities for collaboration and innovation

											What is certain is that the individual talent

											President Obama and his team

The president of what was once the most expensive college in America, Coleman made a radical, controversial plan to snap the college out of a budget and mission slump -- by ending the tenure system, abolishing academic divisions and yes, firing a lot of professors. It was not a period without drama. But fifteen years on, it appears that the move has paid off. <strong>Bennington&#39;s emphasis on cross-disciplinary, hands-on learning</strong> has attracted capacity classes to the small college, and has built a vibrant environment for a new kind of learning.</p><p>Coleman&#39;s idea is that <strong>higher education is an active pursuit -- a performing art</strong>. Her vision calls for lots of one-on-one interactions between professor and student, deep engagement with primary sources, highly individual majors, and the destruction of the traditional academic department. It&#39;s a lofty goal that takes plenty of hard work to keep on course.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Liz Coleman","tags":["activism","collaboration","creativity","education","future","social change"],"title":"A call to reinvent liberal arts education","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":608518}]}
