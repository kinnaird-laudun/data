											I want to share some personal friends and stories with you
											that I&#39;ve actually never talked about in public before
											to help illustrate the idea
											and the need and the hope
											for us to reinvent our health care system around the world.
											Twenty-four years ago, I had — a sophomore in college,
											I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved.
											And I ended up in student health,
											and they ran some labwork and came back right away,
											and said, &quot;Kidney problems.&quot;
											And before I knew it, I was involved and thrown into
											this six months of tests and trials and tribulations
											with six doctors across two hospitals
											in this clash of medical titans
											to figure out which one of them was right
											about what was wrong with me.
											And I&#39;m sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound,
											and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once,
											and I&#39;m like, &quot;Uh oh, this is bad news.&quot;
											And their diagnosis was this:
											They said, &quot;You have two rare kidney diseases
											that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually,
											you have cancer-like cells in your immune system
											that we need to start treatment right away,
											and you&#39;ll never be eligible for a kidney transplant,
											and you&#39;re not likely to live more than two or three years.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis,
											it just sucked me in immediately,
											as if I began preparing myself as a patient
											to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me,
											until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room,
											who became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day
											and took me off to the medical library
											and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases,
											and said, &quot;Eric, these people who get this
											are normally in their &#39;70s and &#39;80s.
											They don&#39;t know anything about you. Wake up.
											Take control of your health and get on with your life.&quot;
											And I did.

									<p>
											Now, these people making these proclamations to me
											were not bad people.
											In fact, these professionals were miracle workers,
											but they&#39;re working in a flawed, expensive system that&#39;s set up the wrong way.
											It&#39;s dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need.
											It&#39;s dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us.
											It&#39;s dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails,
											and so something either works or you die.
											And it&#39;s dependent on passive patients
											who just take it and don&#39;t ask any questions.

									<p>
											Now the problem with this model
											is that it&#39;s unsustainable globally.
											It&#39;s unaffordable globally.
											We need to invent what I call a personal health system.
											So what does this personal health system look like,
											and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail?

											Now, I&#39;m going to start by actually sharing with you
											a new friend of mine, Libby,
											somebody I&#39;ve become quite attached to over the last six months.
											This is Libby, or actually, this is an ultrasound image of Libby.
											This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have.
											Now, this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today,
											and you&#39;ll notice, on the edge of this image,
											there&#39;s some dark spots there, which was really concerning to me.
											So we&#39;re going to actually do a live exam
											to sort of see how Libby&#39;s doing.
											This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here.
											Don&#39;t you in the front row worry or anything.
											(Laughter)
											I&#39;m going to use a device from a company called Mobisante.
											This is a portable ultrasound.
											It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet.
											Mobisante is up in Redmond, Washington,
											and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself.
											They&#39;re not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this.
											This is a concept demo, so I want to make that clear.
											All right, I gotta gel up.
											Now the people in the front row are very nervous. (Laughter)

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let&#39;s start with care anywhere.
											Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics
											in the 1780s. It is time to update our thinking.
											We have got to untether clinicians and patients
											from the notion of traveling to a special
											bricks-and-mortar place for all of our care,
											because these places are often the wrong tool,
											and the most expensive tool, for the job.
											And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients,
											especially in an era of superbugs
											and hospital-acquired infections.
											And many countries are going to go brickless from the start
											because they&#39;re never going to be able to afford
											the mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built.
											Now I personally learned that hospitals
											can be a very dangerous place at a young age.
											This was me in third grade.
											I broke my elbow very seriously, had to have surgery,
											worried that they were going to actually lose the arm.
											Recovering from the surgery in the hospital, I get bedsores.
											Those bedsores become infected,
											and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to,
											and now my whole body breaks out,
											and now all of those become infected.
											The longer I stayed in the hospital, the sicker I became,
											and the more expensive it became,
											and this happens to millions of people around the world every year.
											The future of personal health that I&#39;m talking about
											says care must occur at home as the default model,
											not in a hospital or clinic.
											You have to earn your way into those places
											by being sick enough to use that tool for the job.
											Now the smartphones that we&#39;re already carrying
											can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them,
											and a whole array of others, today,
											and as sensing is built into these,
											we&#39;ll be able to do vital signs monitor
											and behavioral monitoring like we&#39;ve never had before.
											Many of us will have implantables that will actually look
											real-time at what&#39;s going on with our blood chemistry
											and in our proteins right now.
											Now the software is also getting smarter, right?
											Think about a coach, an agent online,
											that&#39;s going to help me do safe self-care.
											That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound
											will likely have real-time image processing,
											and the device will say, &quot;Up, down, left, right,
											ah, Eric, that&#39;s the perfect spot to send that image
											off to your doctor.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, if we&#39;ve got all these networked devices
											that are helping us to do care anywhere,
											it stands to reason that we also need a team
											to be able to interact with all of that stuff,
											and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about,
											care networking.
											We have got to go beyond this paradigm
											of isolated specialists doing parts care
											to multidisciplinary teams doing person care.
											Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best,
											and it is deadly at worst.
											Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused
											by communication and coordination problems
											amongst medical team members.
											I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school,
											when we&#39;re under treatment for the kidney,
											and suddenly, they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, we think you have a heart problem.&quot;
											And I have these palpitations that are showing up.
											They put me through five weeks of tests —
											very expensive, very scary — before the nurse finally notices
											the piece of the paper, my meds list
											that I&#39;ve been carrying to every single appointment,
											and says, &quot;Oh my gosh.&quot;
											Three different specialists had prescribed
											three different versions of the same drug to me.
											I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem.
											I had a care coordination problem.
											And this happens to millions of people every year.
											I want to use technology that we&#39;re all working on and making happen
											to make health care a coordinated team sport.
											Now this is the most frightening thing to me.
											Out of all the care I&#39;ve had in hospitals and clinics around the world,
											the first time I&#39;ve ever had a true team-based care experience
											was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months
											for me to go get this.
											And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy.
											There&#39;s a couple of the folks here. You&#39;ll recognize Dr. Batiuk.
											We just talked to him. Here&#39;s Jenny, one of the nurses,
											Allison, who helped manage the transplant list,
											and a dozen other people who aren&#39;t pictured,
											a pharmacist, a psychologist, a nutritionist,
											even a financial counselor, Lisa,
											who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles.
											I wept the day I graduated.
											I should have been happy, because I was so well
											that I could go back to my normal doctors,
											but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And here&#39;s the most important part.
											The other people in this picture are me and my wife, Ashley.
											Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home
											so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics.
											That&#39;s the only way that the model works.
											My team is actually working in China
											on one of these self-care models
											for a project we called Age-Friendly Cities.
											We&#39;re trying to help build a social network
											that can help track and train the care of seniors
											caring for themselves
											as well as the care provided by their family members
											or volunteer community health workers,
											as well as have an exchange network online,
											where, for example, I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom,
											if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals,
											and we exchange all of that online.
											The most important point I want to make to you about this
											is the sacred and somewhat over-romanticized
											doctor-patient one-on-one
											is a relic of the past.
											The future of health care is smart teams,
											and you&#39;d better be on that team for yourself.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, the last thing that I want to talk to you about
											is care customization,
											because if you&#39;ve got care anywhere and you&#39;ve got care networking,
											those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system,
											but there&#39;s still too much guesswork.
											Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in 1948
											to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis,
											and those are important things, don&#39;t get me wrong.
											These population studies that we&#39;ve done have created
											tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives,
											but the problem is that health care
											is treating us as averages, not unique individuals,
											because at the end of the day,
											the patient is not the same thing as the population
											who are studied. That&#39;s what&#39;s leading to the guesswork.
											The technologies that are coming,
											high-performance computing, analytics,
											big data that everyone&#39;s talking about,
											will allow us to build predictive models for each of us
											as individual patients.
											And the magic here is, experiment on my avatar
											in software, not my body in suffering.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, I&#39;ve had two examples I want to quickly share with you
											of this kind of care customization on my own journey.
											The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago
											that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity.
											It&#39;s like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live.
											I was optimizing my life for quality of life,
											and quality of life for me means time in snow.
											So on my chart, I forced them to put, &quot;Patient goal:
											low doses of drugs over longer periods of time,
											side effects friendly to skiing.&quot;
											And I think that&#39;s why I achieved longevity.
											I think that time-in-snow therapy was as important
											as the pharmaceuticals that I had.
											Now the second example of customization — and by the way,
											you can&#39;t customize care if you don&#39;t know your own goals,
											so health care can&#39;t know those until you know your own health care goals.
											But the second example I want to give you is,
											I happened to be an early guinea pig,
											and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced.
											Now it took about two weeks of processing
											on Intel&#39;s highest-end servers to make this happen,
											and another six months of human and computing labor
											to make sense of all of that data.
											And at the end of all of that, they said, &quot;Yes,
											those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans
											all of those years ago were wrong,
											and we have a better path forward.&quot;
											The future that Intel&#39;s working on now is to figure out
											how to make that computing for personalized medicine
											go from months and weeks to even hours,
											and make this kind of tool available,
											not just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world,
											but in the mainstream — every patient, every clinic
											with access to whole genome sequencing.
											And I tell you, this kind of care customization
											for everything from your goals to your genetics
											will be the most game-changing transformation
											that we witness in health care during our lifetime.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So these three pillars of personal health,
											care anywhere, care networking, care customization,
											are happening in pieces now,
											but this vision will completely fail if we don&#39;t step up
											as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles.
											It&#39;s what my friend Verna said:
											Wake up and take control of your health.
											Because at the end of the day these technologies
											are simply about people caring for other people
											and ourselves in some powerful new ways.
