											We all make decisions every day; we want to know
											what the right thing is to do — in domains from the financial
											to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.
											And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do
											exactly the right thing at all possible times,
											that would be a tremendous gift.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

									<p>
											It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738
											by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.
											And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,
											and I also want to explain to you why it is
											that it hasn&#39;t made a damn bit of difference.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, this is Bernoulli&#39;s gift. This is a direct quote.
											And if it looks like Greek to you, it&#39;s because, well, it&#39;s Greek.
											But the simple English translation — much less precise,
											but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say — was this:
											The expected value of any of our actions —
											that is, the goodness that we can count on getting —
											is the product of two simple things:
											the odds that this action will allow us to gain something,
											and the value of that gain to us.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,
											if we can estimate and multiply these two things,
											we will always know precisely how we should behave.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, this simple equation, even for those of you
											who don&#39;t like equations, is something that you&#39;re quite used to.
											Here&#39;s an example: if I were to tell you, let&#39;s play
											a little coin toss game, and I&#39;m going to flip a coin,
											and if it comes up heads, I&#39;m going to pay you 10 dollars,
											but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,
											most of you would say, sure, I&#39;ll take that bet. Because you know
											that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,
											that multiplies to five, and that&#39;s more
											than I&#39;m charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.
											This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, the idea is simple when we&#39;re applying it to coin tosses,
											but in fact, it&#39;s not very simple in everyday life.
											People are horrible at estimating both of these things,
											and that&#39;s what I want to talk to you about today.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide
											what the right thing is to do, and those are
											errors in estimating the odds that they&#39;re going to succeed,
											and errors in estimating the value of their own success.
											Now, let me talk about the first one first.
											Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:
											there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.
											You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades
											or of flipping a heads.
											But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply
											in everyday life. That&#39;s why Americans spend more —
											I should say, lose more — gambling
											than on all other forms of entertainment combined.
											The reason is, this isn&#39;t how people do odds.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The way people figure odds
											requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.
											Now, the question I&#39;m going to put to you is whether you think
											there are more dogs or pigs on leashes
											observed in any particular day in Oxford.
											And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.
											And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is
											you quickly reviewed in memory the times
											you&#39;ve seen dogs and pigs on leashes.
											It was very easy to remember seeing dogs,
											not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed
											that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,
											then dogs on leashes are more probable.
											That&#39;s not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.

											So, for example, here&#39;s a word puzzle.
											Are there more four-letter English words
											with R in the third place or R in the first place?
											Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,
											and it&#39;s awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,
											and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.
											But in fact, there are many more words in the English language
											with R in the third than the first place.
											The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind
											isn&#39;t because they&#39;re improbable, unlikely or infrequent.
											It&#39;s because the mind recalls words by their first letter.
											You kind of shout out the sound, S — and the word comes.
											It&#39;s like the dictionary;
											it&#39;s hard to look things up by the third letter.
											So, this is an example of how this idea that
											the quickness with which things come to mind
											can give you a sense of their probability —

											how this idea could lead you astray. It&#39;s not just puzzles, though.
											For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds
											that they will die in a variety of interesting ways —
											these are estimates of number of deaths per year
											per 200 million U.S. citizens.
											And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked
											to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.

											Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,
											two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.
											Two things are vastly underestimated:
											dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?
											When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper

											we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,
											or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check —
											how the hell do you cash things that size, I don&#39;t know.
											We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.
											When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews
											with everybody who lost?
											Indeed, if we required that television stations run

											every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers
											in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years

											&quot;What else can I do with my money,&quot; comparing this investment

											Most people don&#39;t want the most expensive,

											This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain
											by waiting, but you have to be patient.
											What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?
											Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.
											That is, they require interest rates in the hundred
											or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification
											and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.
											Maybe that isn&#39;t so remarkable, but what is remarkable is
											how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing
											when the delivery of these monetary units will happen.
											Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year — that&#39;s 12 months —
											or 60 dollars in 13 months.
											What do we find now?
											People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they&#39;re waiting 12,
											they might as well wait 13.

											The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you&#39;ve already heard
											in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:
											namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world
											than the one in which we are living.
											They were evolved for a world
											in which people lived in very small groups,
											rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,
											had rather short lives in which there were few choices

											Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently
											with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes
											that American security dollars should go to making borders safer.
											I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name
											based on people&#39;s psychological reaction to a set of events,
											and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask
											what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,
											rather than — not rather than, but in addition to
											stopping the atrocities that we&#39;re all concerned about.
											Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to —
											and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.
											We already know, for example, in the United States,
											more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes —
											because they were scared — and driving on highways,
											than were killed in 9/11. OK?
											If I told you that there was a plague
											that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,
											you might be alarmed if you didn&#39;t find out it was the flu.
											These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering
											whether they should get the kind of play,
											the kind of coverage, that they do.
											Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood
											that they&#39;ll be hurt in these various ways,
											and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.

											DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical

											My guess is that there&#39;s nothing quite that specific

											that most organisms are neo-phobic — that is, they&#39;re a little scared

											Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about
											the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect
											you&#39;re making the exact same error you&#39;re accusing those people of,
											which is the error of value.
											I know, because I&#39;ve interviewed
											about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.
											It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.
											That&#39;s what you think it is. All right?
											The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,
											so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,
											and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?
											It&#39;s not because she is stupid or he is stupid.
											It&#39;s because the anticipation of possibly winning
											releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling
											until the drawing indicates you&#39;ve lost.
											Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,
											you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money
											down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.
											Now, economists tend to —
											(Applause)
											— economists tend to view the world
											through their own lenses, which is:
											this is just a bunch of stupid people.
											And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.
											And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,
											we didn&#39;t listen to the economists. Thank you very much.

											DG: Well, no, it&#39;s a great point. It remains to be seen
											whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled
											by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,
											people who didn&#39;t buy tickets don&#39;t feel awful the next day either,
											even though they don&#39;t feel great during the drawing.
											I would disagree that people know they&#39;re not going to win.
											I think they think it&#39;s unlikely, but it could happen,
											which is why they prefer that to the flushing.
											But certainly I see your point: that there can be
											some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.
											Now, I think there&#39;s many good reasons not to listen to economists.
											That isn&#39;t one of them, for me, but there&#39;s many others.

											DG: Ah, for you in persuading them.
											Well, it&#39;s notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.
											But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work
											is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.
											One of the problems with making decisions about the far future
											and the near future is that we imagine the near future
											much more vividly than the far future.
											To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail
											that people put into the mental representations
											of near and far future, people begin to make decisions
											about the two in the same way.
											So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you&#39;re 65
											is a question that&#39;s very different than,
											imagine who you&#39;ll be when you&#39;re 65: will you be living,
											what will you look like, how much hair will you have,
											who will you be living with.
											Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,
											suddenly we feel like it might be important to save
											so that that guy has a little retirement money.
											But these are tricks around the margins.
											I think in general you&#39;re battling a very fundamental human tendency,

In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>.
