											And the reason, I only worked out
just the other day,
											which is: when you go
to a drinks party and you stand up
											and hold a glass of red wine
and you talk endlessly to people,
											you don&#39;t actually want to spend
all the time talking.
											It&#39;s really, really tiring.

silently, alone with your thoughts.

in the corner and stare out of the window.

											So the power of reframing things
											cannot be overstated.
											What we have is exactly
the same thing, the same activity,
											but one of them makes you feel great
											and the other one,
with just a small change of posture,
											makes you feel terrible.
											And I think one of the problems
with classical economics is,
											it&#39;s absolutely preoccupied with reality.
											And reality isn&#39;t a particularly good
guide to human happiness.
											Why, for example,
are pensioners much happier
											than the young unemployed?
											Both of them, after all,
are in exactly the same stage of life.
											You both have too much time
on your hands and not much money.
											But pensioners are reportedly
very, very happy,
											whereas the unemployed
are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed.
											The reason, I think,
is that the pensioners believe
											they&#39;ve chosen to be pensioners,
											whereas the young unemployed
feel it&#39;s been thrust upon them.

											In England, the upper-middle classes have
actually solved this problem perfectly,

											I think it&#39;s because there&#39;s an imbalance,

											If you&#39;re a creative person,

was what you extracted from the land.

											The best thing you can do there
to create value

the food still further,

and clean up the floor.

											If that seems like a sort
of strange, abstruse thing —
											in the UK, the post office
had a 98 percent success rate
											at delivering first-class
mail the next day.
											They decided this wasn&#39;t good enough,
											and they wanted to get it up to 99.
											The effort to do that
almost broke the organization.
											If, at the same time,
you&#39;d gone and asked people,
											&quot;What percentage of first-class mail
arrives the next day?&quot;
											the average answer, or the modal answer,
would have been &quot;50 to 60 percent.&quot;
											Now, if your perception
is much worse than your reality,
											what on earth are you doing
trying to change the reality?
											That&#39;s like trying to improve the food
in a restaurant that stinks.
											What you need to do is,
first of all, tell people
											that 98 percent of first-class mail
gets there the next day.
											That&#39;s pretty good.
											I would argue, in Britain,
there&#39;s a much better frame of reference,
											which is to tell people that more
first-class mail arrives the next day
											in the UK than in Germany,
because generally, in Britain,
											if you want to make us happy
about something,
											just tell us we do it
better than the Germans.

											Choose your frame of reference
and the perceived value,
											and therefore, the actual value
is completely transformed.
											It has to be said of the Germans
											that the Germans and the French
are doing a brilliant job

											The only thing they didn&#39;t expect
is they&#39;re uniting Europe
											through a shared mild hatred

											What you&#39;ll also notice
is that, in any case,
											our perception is leaky.
											We can&#39;t tell the difference
between the quality of the food
											and the environment
in which we consume it.
											All of you will have seen this phenomenon
											if you have your car washed or valeted.
											When you drive away,
your car feels as if it drives better.

											And the reason for this —

											is because perception
is, in any case, leaky.

											Analgesics that are branded
are more effective at reducing pain
											than analgesics that are not branded.
											I don&#39;t just mean through reported
pain reduction —
											actual measured pain reduction.

actually is leaky in any case.
											So if you do something
that&#39;s perceptually bad in one respect,
