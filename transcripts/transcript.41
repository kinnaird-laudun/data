											Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said
											on his first successful telephone call,
											&quot;Hello, is that Domino&#39;s Pizza?&quot;
											(Laughter)
											I just really want to thank you very much.
											As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,
											&quot;What a strange, long trip.&quot;
											And he should have said,
											&quot;What a strange, long trip it&#39;s about to become.&quot;
											At this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.
											My lower half is appearing at a different conference
											(Laughter)
											in a different country.
											You can, it turns out, be in two places at once.
											But still, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be with you in person.
											I&#39;ll explain at another time.

											And though I&#39;m a rock star,
											I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.
											But what really turns me on about technology
											is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.
											The revolution — this revolution — is much bigger than that.
											I hope, I believe.
											What turns me on about the digital age,
											what excites me personally,
											is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.
											You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,
											you needed a studio and a producer.
											Now, you need a laptop.
											If you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment
											and a Hollywood budget.
											Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm,
											and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.
											Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.
											And that really, really excites me.
											I&#39;m excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.

											What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.
											Political, economic, psychological, whatever.
											The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.
											From the ease with which you swept away obstacles
											that no one knew could even be budged.
											And that&#39;s actually what I&#39;d like to talk about today.
											First, though, I should probably explain why, and how,
											I got to this place.
											It&#39;s a journey that started 20 years ago.
											You may remember that song, &quot;We Are the World,&quot;
											or, &quot;Do They Know It&#39;s Christmas?&quot;
											Band Aid, Live Aid.
											Another very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof,
											issued a challenge to &quot;feed the world.&quot;
											It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.
											That summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.
											We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.
											We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.
											The children had a name for me.
											They called me, &quot;The girl with the beard.&quot;

											Don&#39;t ask.
											Anyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.
											Big skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.
											Beautiful, royal people.
											Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.
											Ethiopia didn&#39;t just blow my mind; it opened my mind.
											Anyway, on our last day at this orphanage
											a man handed me his baby and said,
											&quot;Would you take my son with you?&quot;
											He knew, in Ireland, that his son would live,
											and that in Ethiopia, his son would die.
											It was the middle of that awful famine.
											Well, I turned him down.
											And it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.
											And it&#39;s a feeling I can&#39;t ever quite forget.
											And in that moment, I started this journey.

											In that moment, I became the worst thing of all:
											I became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter)
											Except this isn&#39;t the cause, is it?
											Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS —
											a preventable, treatable disease —
											for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.
											That&#39;s not a cause. That&#39;s an emergency.
											11 million AIDS orphans in Africa,
											20 million by the end of the decade.
											That&#39;s not a cause. That&#39;s an emergency.
											Today, every day, 9,000 more Africans
											will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.
											That&#39;s not a cause. That&#39;s an emergency.
											So what we&#39;re talking about here is human rights.
											The right to live like a human.
											The right to live, period.
											And what we&#39;re facing in Africa is
											an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.

											The next thing I&#39;d like to be clear about is what this problem is,
											and what this problem isn&#39;t.
											Because this is not all about charity.
											This is about justice. Really.
											This is not about charity. This is about justice.
											That&#39;s right.
											And that&#39;s too bad, because we&#39;re very good at charity.
											Americans, like Irish people, are good at it.
											Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.
											We like to give, and we give a lot.
											Look at the response to the tsunami — it&#39;s inspiring.
											But justice is a tougher standard than charity.
											You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.
											It makes a farce of our idea of equality.
											It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.
											It questions our commitment.
											Because there is no way we can look at what&#39;s happening in Africa,
											and if we&#39;re honest,
											conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.

											You see, it&#39;s not as dramatic as the tsunami.

											Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days

											Catastrophes that we can avert

											&quot;The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty.&quot;

											This year is a test for us all,

											we&#39;re not going to be denied.
											We will have the ear of Congress.
											We&#39;ll be the first page in Condi Rice&#39;s briefing book,

											who are ready to make phone calls,
											who are ready to be on email,
											I am absolutely sure that we can actually change
											the course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.
