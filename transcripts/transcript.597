											I&#39;m going to talk today
about energy and climate.
											And that might seem a bit surprising,
											because my full-time work
at the foundation
											is mostly about vaccines and seeds,
											about the things that we need
to invent and deliver
											to help the poorest two billion
live better lives.
											But energy and climate
are extremely important to these people;
											in fact, more important
than to anyone else on the planet.
											The climate getting worse means
that many years, their crops won&#39;t grow:
											there will be too much rain,
not enough rain;
											things will change in ways their fragile
environment simply can&#39;t support.
											And that leads to starvation, it leads
to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.
											So, the climate changes
will be terrible for them.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Also, the price of energy
is very important to them.
											In fact, if you could pick just one thing
											to lower the price of to reduce poverty,
by far you would pick energy.
											Now, the price of energy
has come down over time.
											Really advanced civilization
is based on advances in energy.
											The coal revolution fueled
the Industrial Revolution,
											and, even in the 1900s,
we&#39;ve seen a very rapid decline
											in the price of electricity,
											and that&#39;s why we have
refrigerators, air-conditioning;
											we can make modern materials
and do so many things.
											And so, we&#39;re in a wonderful situation
with electricity in the rich world.
											But as we make it cheaper —
and let&#39;s say,
											let&#39;s go for making it twice as cheap —
											we need to meet a new constraint,
											and that constraint has to do with CO2.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											CO2 is warming the planet,
											and the equation on CO2
is actually a very straightforward one.
											If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,
											that leads to a temperature increase,
											and that temperature increase
leads to some very negative effects:
											the effects on the weather;
perhaps worse, the indirect effects,
											in that the natural ecosystems
can&#39;t adjust to these rapid changes,
											and so you get ecosystem collapses.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, the exact amount of how you map
from a certain increase of CO2
											to what temperature will be,
and where the positive feedbacks are —
											there&#39;s some uncertainty there,
but not very much.
											And there&#39;s certainly uncertainty
about how bad those effects will be,
											but they will be extremely bad.
											I asked the top scientists
on this several times:
											Do we really have to get
down to near zero?
											Can&#39;t we just cut it in half or a quarter?
											And the answer is,
until we get near to zero,
											the temperature will continue to rise.
											And so that&#39;s a big challenge.
											It&#39;s very different than saying,
											&quot;We&#39;re a twelve-foot-high truck
trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,
											and we can just sort of squeeze under.&quot;
											This is something that has to get to zero.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, we put out a lot
of carbon dioxide every year —
											over 26 billion tons.
											For each American, it&#39;s about 20 tons.
											For people in poor countries,
it&#39;s less than one ton.
											It&#39;s an average of about five tons
for everyone on the planet.
											And somehow, we have to make changes
that will bring that down to zero.
											It&#39;s been constantly going up.
											It&#39;s only various economic changes
that have even flattened it at all,
											so we have to go
from rapidly rising to falling,
											and falling all the way to zero.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This equation has four factors,
a little bit of multiplication.
											So you&#39;ve got a thing on the left,
CO2, that you want to get to zero,
											and that&#39;s going to be based
on the number of people,
											the services each person
is using on average,
											the energy, on average, for each service,
											and the CO2 being put out
per unit of energy.
											So let&#39;s look at each one of these,
											and see how we can get this down to zero.
											Probably, one of these numbers is going
to have to get pretty near to zero.

											Now, if we do a really great job
on new vaccines,
											health care, reproductive health services,

											The second factor is the services we use.
											This encompasses everything:
											the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.
											These are very good things.
											Getting rid of poverty means
providing these services
											to almost everyone on the planet.
											And it&#39;s a great thing
for this number to go up.
											In the rich world, perhaps
the top one billion,
											we probably could cut back and use less,
											but every year, this number,
on average, is going to go up,
											and so, overall,
that will more than double
											the services delivered per person.
											Here we have a very basic service:
											Do you have lighting in your house
to be able to read your homework?
											And, in fact, these kids don&#39;t,
											so they&#39;re going out and reading
their schoolwork
											under the street lamps.

											Now, efficiency, &quot;E,&quot;
the energy for each service —
											here, finally we have some good news.
											We have something that&#39;s not going up.
											Through various inventions
and new ways of doing lighting,
											through different types of cars,
different ways of building buildings —
											there are a lot of services
											where you can bring the energy
for that service down
											quite substantially.
											Some individual services
even bring it down by 90 percent.
											There are other services,
like how we make fertilizer,
											or how we do air transport,
											where the rooms for improvement
are far, far less.
											And so overall, if we&#39;re optimistic,
we may get a reduction
											of a factor of three to even,
perhaps, a factor of six.
											But for these first three factors now,
											we&#39;ve gone from 26 billion
to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,
											and that just won&#39;t cut it.

											So let&#39;s look at this fourth factor —
this is going to be a key one —
											and this is the amount of CO2
put out per each unit of energy.
											So the question is:
Can you actually get that to zero?
											If you burn coal, no.
											If you burn natural gas, no.
											Almost every way
we make electricity today,
											except for the emerging renewables
and nuclear, puts out CO2.
											And so, what we&#39;re going to have
to do at a global scale,
											is create a new system.
											So we need energy miracles.

I don&#39;t mean something that&#39;s impossible.
											The microprocessor is a miracle.

											The Internet and its services
are a miracle.
											So the people here have participated

by a certain date.
											Usually, you just kind of stand by,

											Now, there&#39;s all sorts of gimmicky
solutions like that one,

											We need solutions, either one or several,
											that have unbelievable scale
and unbelievable reliability.
											And although there&#39;s many directions
that people are seeking,
											I really only see five
that can achieve the big numbers.
											I&#39;ve left out tide,
geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
											Those may make some contribution,
											and if they can do better
than I expect, so much the better.
											But my key point here
is that we&#39;re going to have to work on

											and we can&#39;t give up any of them

											because they all have
significant challenges.

											Let&#39;s look first at burning fossil fuels,
											either burning coal
or burning natural gas.
											What you need to do there seems
like it might be simple, but it&#39;s not.
											And that&#39;s to take all the CO2,
											after you&#39;ve burned it,
going out the flue,
											pressurize it, create a liquid,
put it somewhere,
											and hope it stays there.
											Now, we have some pilot things
											that do this at the 60 to 80
percent level.
											But getting up to that full percentage —
that will be very tricky.
											And agreeing on where these CO2
quantities should be put will be hard,
											but the toughest one here
is this long-term issue:
											Who&#39;s going to be sure?
											Who&#39;s going to guarantee
											something that is literally
billions of times larger
											than any type of waste you think of
in terms of nuclear or other things?
											This is a lot of volume.
											So that&#39;s a tough one.

											Next would be nuclear.
											It also has three big problems:
											cost, particularly in highly
regulated countries, is high;
											the issue of safety, really feeling good
about nothing could go wrong,
											that, even though you have
these human operators,
											the fuel doesn&#39;t get used for weapons.
											And then what do you do with the waste?
											Although it&#39;s not very large,
there are a lot of concerns about that.
											People need to feel good about it.
											So three very tough problems
that might be solvable,
											and so, should be worked on.

											The last three of the five,
I&#39;ve grouped together.
											These are what people often refer to
as the renewable sources.
											And they actually — although it&#39;s great
they don&#39;t require fuel —
											they have some disadvantages.
											One is that the density of energy
gathered in these technologies
											is dramatically less than a power plant.
											This is energy farming,
											so you&#39;re talking about many square miles,
thousands of times more area
											than you think of
as a normal energy plant.
											Also, these are intermittent sources.
											The sun doesn&#39;t shine all day,
it doesn&#39;t shine every day,
											and likewise, the wind
doesn&#39;t blow all the time.
											And so, if you depend on these sources,
											you have to have some way
of getting the energy
											during those time periods
that it&#39;s not available.
											So we&#39;ve got big cost challenges here.
											We have transmission challenges;
											for example, say this energy source
is outside your country,
											you not only need the technology,
											but you have to deal with the risk
of the energy coming from elsewhere.

											And, finally, this storage problem.
											To dimensionalize this,
											I went through and looked
at all the types of batteries made —
											for cars, for computers, for phones,
for flashlights, for everything —
											and compared that to the amount
of electrical energy the world uses.
											What I found is that all
the batteries we make now
											could store less than 10 minutes
of all the energy.
											And so, in fact, we need
a big breakthrough here,
											something that&#39;s going to be
a factor of 100 better
											than the approaches we have now.
											It&#39;s not impossible,
but it&#39;s not a very easy thing.
											Now, this shows up when you try
to get the intermittent source
											to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent
of what you&#39;re using.
											If you&#39;re counting on it for 100 percent,
											you need an incredible miracle battery.

											Now, how are we going to go forward
on this — what&#39;s the right approach?
											Is it a Manhattan Project?
What&#39;s the thing that can get us there?
											Well, we need lots of companies
working on this — hundreds.
											In each of these five paths,
we need at least a hundred people.
											A lot of them, you&#39;ll look at
and say, &quot;They&#39;re crazy.&quot;
											That&#39;s good.
											And, I think, here in the TED group,
											we have many people
who are already pursuing this.
											Bill Gross has several companies,
including one called eSolar
											that has some great
solar thermal technologies.
											Vinod Khosla is investing
in dozens of companies
											that are doing great things
and have interesting possibilities,
											and I&#39;m trying to help back that.
											Nathan Myhrvold and I
actually are backing a company
											that, perhaps surprisingly,
is actually taking the nuclear approach.
											There are some innovations
in nuclear: modular, liquid.
											Innovation really stopped
in this industry quite some ago,
											so the idea that there&#39;s some
good ideas laying around
											is not all that surprising.

											The idea of TerraPower is that,
instead of burning a part of uranium —
											the one percent, which is the U235 —
											we decided, &quot;Let&#39;s burn
the 99 percent, the U238.&quot;
											It is kind of a crazy idea.
											In fact, people had talked
about it for a long time,
											but they could never simulate properly
whether it would work or not,
											and so it&#39;s through the advent
of modern supercomputers
											that now you can simulate
and see that, yes,
											with the right materials approach,
this looks like it would work.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And because you&#39;re burning
that 99 percent,
											you have greatly improved cost profile.
											You actually burn up the waste,
and you can actually use as fuel
											all the leftover waste
from today&#39;s reactors.
											So instead of worrying about them,
you just take that, it&#39;s a great thing.
											It breeds this uranium as it goes along,
so it&#39;s kind of like a candle.
											You see it&#39;s a log there, often
referred to as a traveling wave reactor.
											In terms of fuel,
this really solves the problem.
											I&#39;ve got a picture here
of a place in Kentucky.
											This is the leftover, the 99 percent,
											where they&#39;ve taken out
the part they burn now,
											so it&#39;s called depleted uranium.
											That would power the US
for hundreds of years.
											And simply by filtering seawater
in an inexpensive process,
											you&#39;d have enough fuel for the entire
lifetime of the rest of the planet.

											So, you know, it&#39;s got lots
of challenges ahead,
											but it is an example of the many
hundreds and hundreds of ideas
											that we need to move forward.
											So let&#39;s think: How should
we measure ourselves?
											What should our report card look like?
											Well, let&#39;s go out to where
we really need to get,
											and then look at the intermediate.
											For 2050, you&#39;ve heard many people
talk about this 80 percent reduction.
											That really is very important,
that we get there.
											And that 20 percent will be used up
by things going on in poor countries —
											still some agriculture; hopefully,
we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.
											So, to get to that 80 percent,
											the developed countries,
including countries like China,
											will have had to switch
their electricity generation altogether.
											The other grade is: Are we deploying
this zero-emission technology,
											have we deployed it
in all the developed countries
											and are in the process
of getting it elsewhere?
											That&#39;s super important.
											That&#39;s a key element
of making that report card.

									<p>
											Backing up from there, what should
the 2020 report card look like?
											Well, again, it should have
the two elements.
											We should go through these efficiency
measures to start getting reductions:
											The less we emit,
the less that sum will be of CO2,
											and therefore, the less the temperature.
											But in some ways, the grade we get there,
											doing things that don&#39;t get us
all the way to the big reductions,
											is only equally, or maybe even slightly
less, important than the other,
											which is the piece of innovation
on these breakthroughs.

											These breakthroughs,
we need to move those at full speed,
											and we can measure that
in terms of companies,

that have been changed.
											There&#39;s a lot of great books
that have been written about this.
											The Al Gore book, &quot;Our Choice,&quot;
											and the David MacKay book,
&quot;Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.&quot;

is the most important thing.

without the environmental constraint,

just makes it so much greater.

there are other innovators.
											You know, we don&#39;t know their work

that&#39;s a different approach.
											There&#39;s a liquid-type reactor,
which seems a little hard,

											And so, there are different ones,
											but the beauty of this
is a molecule of uranium
											has a million times as much energy
as a molecule of, say, coal.

spending on the R&amp;D piece —
											say the US should spend 10 billion a year
more than it is right now —
											it&#39;s not that dramatic.
											It shouldn&#39;t take away from other things.
											The thing you get into big money on,
and reasonable people can disagree,
											is when you have something
that&#39;s non-economic
											and you&#39;re trying to fund that —
											that, to me, mostly is a waste.
											Unless you&#39;re very close,
											and you&#39;re just funding the learning curve
and it&#39;s going to get very cheap,
											I believe we should try more things
											that have a potential
to be far less expensive.
											If the trade-off you get into is,
&quot;Let&#39;s make energy super expensive,&quot;

											He&#39;s still, because of his earlier stuff,
											still associated with the skeptic camp,

that&#39;s a pretty lonely camp,

A geek icon, tech visionary and business trailblazer, Gates&#39; leadership -- fueled by his long-held dream that <strong>millions might realize their potential through great software</strong> -- made Microsoft a personal computing powerhouse and a trendsetter in the Internet dawn. Whether you&#39;re a suit, chef, quant, artist, media maven, nurse or gamer, you&#39;ve probably used a Microsoft product today.<br /><br />In summer of 2008, Gates left his day-to-day role with Microsoft to focus on philanthropy. Holding that <strong>all lives have equal value (no matter where they&#39;re being lived)</strong>, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has now donated staggering sums to HIV/AIDS programs, libraries, agriculture research and disaster relief -- and offered vital guidance and creative funding to programs in global health and education.
