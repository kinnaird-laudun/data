											My journey to become a polar specialist,
											photographing, specializing
in the polar regions,
											began when I was four years old,
											when my family moved from southern Canada
											to Northern Baffin Island,
up by Greenland.
											There we lived with the Inuit
											in the tiny Inuit community
of 200 Inuit people,
											where [we] were one
of three non-Inuit families.
											And in this community,
we didn&#39;t have a television;
											we didn&#39;t have computers,
obviously, radio.
											We didn&#39;t even have a telephone.
											All of my time was spent outside
											with the Inuit, playing.
											The snow and the ice were my sandbox,
											and the Inuit were my teachers.
											And that&#39;s where I became
											truly obsessed with this polar realm.
											And I knew someday that
I was going to do something
											that had to do with trying
to share news about it
											and protect it.

											I&#39;d like to share with you,
for just two minutes only,
											some images, a cross-section of my work,
											to the beautiful music
by Brandi Carlile, &quot;Have You Ever.&quot;
											I don&#39;t know why National Geographic
has done this, they&#39;ve never done this before,
											but they&#39;re allowing me
to show you a few images
											from a coverage that I&#39;ve just completed
that is not published yet.
											National Geographic doesn&#39;t do this,
											so I&#39;m very excited to be able
to share this with you.

											you&#39;ll see them at the start of the slide show —
there&#39;s only about four images —
											but it&#39;s of a little bear
that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.
											It&#39;s pure white,
but it&#39;s not a polar bear.
											It&#39;s a spirit bear,
or a Kermode bear.
											There are only 200 of these bears left.
											They&#39;re more rare than the panda bear.

											I sat there on the river
for two months without seeing one.
											I thought, my career&#39;s over.
											I proposed this stupid story
to National Geographic.
											What in the heck was I thinking?
											So I had two months to sit there
											and figure out different ways
of what I was going to do in my next life,
											after I was a photographer,
because they were going to fire me.
											Because National Geographic is a magazine;
they remind us all the time:
											they publish pictures, not excuses.

											And after two months of sitting there —
											one day, thinking that it was all over,
											this incredible big white male came down,
											right beside me, three feet away from me,
											and he went down and grabbed a fish
and went off in the forest and ate it.
											And then I spent the entire day
living my childhood dream
											of walking around with this bear
through the forest.
											He went through this old-growth forest
											and sat up beside this 400-year-old
culturally modified tree and went to sleep.
											And I actually got to sleep
within three feet of him,
											just in the forest, and photograph him.

											We&#39;re inundated with news all the time
											that the sea ice is disappearing
											and it&#39;s at its lowest level.
											And in fact, scientists
were originally saying
											sea ice is going to disappear
in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.
											Now they&#39;re saying
the sea ice in the Arctic,
											the summertime extent is going to be gone
in the next four to 10 years.
											And what does that mean?
											After a while of reading this in the news,
it just becomes news.
											You glaze over with it.
											And what I&#39;m trying to do
with my work is put faces to this.
											And I want people to understand
and get the concept
											that, if we lose ice,
											we stand to lose an entire ecosystem.
											Projections are that we could
lose polar bears, they could become extinct
											in the next 50 to 100 years.

											And there&#39;s no better, sexier,

charismatic megafauna species
											for me to hang my campaign on.
											Polar bears are amazing hunters.
											This was a bear I sat with
for a while on the shores.
											There was no ice around.
											But this glacier caved into the water
and a seal got on it.
											And this bear swam out to that seal —
											800 lb. bearded seal —
											grabbed it, swam back and ate it.
											And he was so full,
he was so happy and so fat eating this seal,
											that, as I approached him —
											about 20 feet away —
to get this picture,
											his only defense was to keep eating more seal.
											And as he ate, he was so full —
											he probably had about
200 lbs of meat in his belly —
											and as he ate inside
one side of his mouth,
											he was regurgitating
out the other side of his mouth.

											So as long as these bears
have any bit of ice they will survive,

											We&#39;re finding more and more
dead bears in the Arctic.
											When I worked on polar bears
as a biologist 20 years ago,
											we never found dead bears.
											And in the last four or five years,
											we&#39;re finding dead bears
popping up all over the place.
											We&#39;re seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,
											floating in the open ocean
where the ice has melted out.
											I found a couple in Norway last year.
We&#39;re seeing them on the ice.

live out their entire life cycle

											This is a piece of multi-year ice
that&#39;s 12 years old.
											And what scientists didn&#39;t predict

is that you have a piece of multi-year ice,

											In that one single piece of ice,

											And in the spring,
when the sun returns to the ice,

											Alright, my favorite part.
											When I&#39;m on my deathbed,

one story more than any other.
											Even though that spirit bear
moment was powerful,
											I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever have
another experience
											like I did with these leopard seals.
											Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton,
have had a bad reputation.
											They&#39;ve got that wryly smile
on their mouth.
											They&#39;ve got those black sinister eyes
											and those spots on their body.
											They look positively prehistoric
and a bit scary.
											And tragically in [2003],
											a scientist was taken down
and drowned,
											and she was being consumed
by a leopard seal.
											And people were like, &quot;We knew
they were vicious. We knew they were.&quot;
											And so people love to form their opinions.
											And that&#39;s when I got a story idea:
											I want to go to Antarctica,
											get in the water with as many
leopard seals as I possibly can
											and give them a fair shake —
											find out if they really are these vicious
animals, or if they&#39;re misunderstood.
											So this is that story.
											Oh, and they also happen
to eat Happy Feet.

											As a species, as humans,
we like to say penguins are really cute,

so leopard seals are ugly and bad.

											The penguin doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s cute,
											and the leopard seal doesn&#39;t
know it&#39;s kind of big and monstrous.
											This is just the food chain unfolding.
											They&#39;re also big.
											They&#39;re not these little harbor seals.
											They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.

											And on the last day with this female
											where I thought I had pushed her too far,
											I got nervous because she came up to me,
											she rolled over on her back,
											and she did this deep, guttural
jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok.
											And I thought, she&#39;s about to bite.
											She&#39;s about to let me know
she&#39;s too frustrated with me.
											What had happened
was another seal had snuck in behind me,
											and she did that to threat display.
											She chased that big seal away,
went and got its penguin
											and brought it to me.

											That wasn&#39;t the only seal
I got in the water with.
											I got in the water
with 30 other leopard seals,
											and I never once had a scary encounter.
											They are the most remarkable animals
I&#39;ve ever worked with,
											and the same with polar bears.
											And just like the polar bears,
											these animals depend
on an icy environment.
											I get emotional. Sorry.

Today he bridges the gap between scientific research and the public, showing how fragile and fast-changing habitats are profoundly affecting wildlife.<br /><br />During the course of his workday Nicklen regularly comes face-to-face with fantastic creatures: narwhals, Arctic foxes, elephant seals, and more.

Best known for his vivid and intimate wildlife photos for <em>National Geographic</em>, Nicklen started out a biologist in the Northwest Territories, gathering data on such species as lynx, grizzlies, and polar bears. Today he bridges the gap between scientific research and the public, showing how fragile and fast-changing habitats are profoundly affecting wildlife.<br /><br />During the course of his workday Nicklen regularly comes face-to-face with fantastic creatures: narwhals, Arctic foxes, elephant seals, and more. His most amazing experience? An underwater encounter with a leopard seal who for four days tried to feed him penguins through the &quot;mouth&quot; of his lens.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Paul Nicklen","tags":["animals","biodiversity","creativity","culture","design","entertainment","photography","storytelling","Antarctica"],"title":"Animal tales from icy wonderlands","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2165059}]}
