											This is a map of New York State
											that was made in 1937
by the General Drafting Company.
											It&#39;s an extremely famous map
among cartography nerds,
											because down here at the bottom
of the Catskill Mountains,
											there is a little town called Roscoe —
											actually, this will go easier
if I just put it up here —
											There&#39;s Roscoe, and then right
above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,
											and then right above that
is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.

											Agloe, New York, is very famous
to cartographers,
											because it&#39;s a paper town.
											It&#39;s also known as a copyright trap.
											Mapmakers — because my map of New York
and your map of New York
											are going to look very similar,
on account of the shape of New York —
											often, mapmakers will insert
fake places onto their maps,
											in order to protect their copyright.
											Because then, if my fake place
shows up on your map,
											I can be well and truly sure
that you have robbed me.
											Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials
of the two guys who made this map,
											Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,
											and they released this map in 1937.
											Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map
											with Agloe, New York, on it,
at the same exact intersection
											of two dirt roads
in the middle of nowhere.
											Well, you can imagine the delight
over at General Drafting.
											They immediately call
Rand McNally, and they say,
											&quot;We&#39;ve caught you!
We made Agloe, New York, up.
											It is a fake place. It&#39;s a paper town.
											We&#39;re going to sue your pants off!&quot;
											And Rand McNally says,
&quot;No, no, no, no, Agloe is real.&quot;
											Because people kept going
to that intersection of two dirt roads —

											But what interests me ultimately more
than the medium in which this happened,
											is the phenomenon itself.
											It&#39;s easy enough to say that the world
shapes our maps of the world, right?
											Like the overall shape of the world
is obviously going to affect our maps.
											But what I find a lot more
interesting is the way
											that the manner in which we map
the world changes the world.
											Because the world would truly be
a different place if North were down.
											And the world would be
a truly different place
											if Alaska and Russia weren&#39;t
on opposite sides of the map.

											So I was a really terrible student
when I was a kid.
											My GPA was consistently in the low 2s.
											And I think the reason that I was
such a terrible student
											is that I felt like education
was just a series of hurdles
											that had been erected before me,
											and I had to jump over
in order to achieve adulthood.
											And I didn&#39;t really want
to jump over these hurdles,
											because they seemed completely
arbitrary, so I often wouldn&#39;t,
											and then people would
threaten me, you know,
											they&#39;d threaten me with this
&quot;going on [my] permanent record,&quot;

one of the first things they did

											And then, when I was in tenth grade,
I went to this school,
											Indian Springs School,
a small boarding school,
											outside of Birmingham, Alabama.
											And all at once I became a learner.
											And I became a learner,
because I found myself
											in a community of learners.
											I found myself surrounded by people
											who celebrated intellectualism
and engagement,
											and who thought that my ironic
oh-so-cool disengagement
											wasn&#39;t clever, or funny,
											but, like, it was a simple
and unspectacular response
											to very complicated
and compelling problems.
											And so I started to learn,
because learning was cool.
											I learned that some infinite sets
are bigger than other infinite sets,
											and I learned that iambic pentameter is
and why it sounds so good to human ears.
											I learned that the Civil War
was a nationalizing conflict,
											I learned some physics,
											I learned that correlation shouldn&#39;t be
confused with causation —
											all of these things, by the way,
											enriched my life
on a literally daily basis.
											And it&#39;s true that I don&#39;t use
most of them for my &quot;job,&quot;
											but that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about for me.
											It&#39;s about cartography.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">

											What is the process of cartography?
											It&#39;s, you know, sailing
upon some land, and thinking,
											&quot;I think I&#39;ll draw that bit of land,&quot;
											and then wondering, &quot;Maybe there&#39;s
some more land to draw.&quot;
											And that&#39;s when learning
really began for me.
											It&#39;s true that I had teachers
that didn&#39;t give up on me,
											and I was very fortunate
to have those teachers,
											because I often gave them cause to think
there was no reason to invest in me.
											But a lot of the learning
that I did in high school
											wasn&#39;t about what happened
inside the classroom,
											it was about what happened
outside of the classroom.
											For instance, I can tell you
											that &quot;There&#39;s a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons —
											That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes —&quot;
											not because I memorized
Emily Dickinson in school
											when I was in high school,
											but because there was a girl
when I was in high school,
											and her name was Amanda,
and I had a crush on her,
											and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.
											The reason I can tell you
what opportunity cost is,
											is because one day when I was playing
Super Mario Kart on my couch,
											my friend Emmet walked in, and he said,
											&quot;How long have you been playing
Super Mario Kart?&quot;
											And I said, &quot;I don&#39;t know,
like, six hours?&quot; and he said,
											&quot;Do you realize that if you&#39;d worked
at Baskin-Robbins those six hours,
											you could have made 30 dollars,
so in some ways,
											you just paid thirty dollars
to play Super Mario Kart.&quot;
											And I was, like, &quot;I&#39;ll take that deal.&quot;

											And along the way, the map
of my life got better.
											It got bigger; it contained more places.
											There were more things that might happen,
											more futures I might have.
											It wasn&#39;t a formal, organized
learning process,
											and I&#39;m happy to admit that.
											It was spotty, it was inconsistent,
there was a lot I didn&#39;t know.
											I might know, you know, Cantor&#39;s idea
											that some infinite sets are larger
than other infinite sets,
											but I didn&#39;t really understand
the calculus behind that idea.
											I might know the idea of opportunity cost,
											but I didn&#39;t know the law
of diminishing returns.
											But the great thing about imagining
learning as cartography,
											instead of imagining it
as arbitrary hurdles
											that you have to jump over,
											is that you see a bit of coastline,
and that makes you want to see more.

											(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built
in the middle of a huge, hot desert.
											Almost everything here was brought
from somewhere else —
											the sort of rocks, the trees,
the waterfalls.
											These fish are almost as out of place
as my pig that flew.
											Contrasted to the scorching desert
that surrounds this place,
											so are these people.
											Things from all over the world have been
rebuilt here, away from their histories,
											and away from the people
that experience them differently.
											Sometimes improvements were made —
even the Sphinx got a nose job.
											Here, there&#39;s no reason to feel
like you&#39;re missing anything.
											This New York means the same to me
as it does to everyone else.
											Everything is out of context, and that
means context allows for everything:
											Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.
											This fabrication of place could be one
of the world&#39;s greatest achievements,
											because no one belongs here;
everyone does.
											As I walked around this morning,
I noticed most of the buildings
											were huge mirrors reflecting
the sun back into the desert.
											But unlike most mirrors,
											which present you with an outside view
of yourself embedded in a place,
											these mirrors come back empty.

											Ze isn&#39;t just a great public intellectual,
he&#39;s also a brilliant community builder,
											and the community of people
that built up around these videos
											was in many ways a community of learners.
											So we played Ze Frank at chess
collaboratively, and we beat him.
											We organized ourselves to take a young man
on a road trip across the United States.
											We turned the Earth into a sandwich,
											by having one person hold a piece of bread
at one point on the Earth,
											and on the exact opposite
point of the Earth,
											have another person
holding a piece of bread.
											I realize that these are silly ideas,
but they are also &quot;learny&quot; ideas,
											and that was what was so exciting to me,
											and if you go online, you can find
communities like this all over the place.
											Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr,
											and yes, you will see people
complaining about calculus,
											but you&#39;ll also see people
re-blogging those complaints,
											making the argument that calculus
is interesting and beautiful,
											and here&#39;s a way in to thinking about
the problem that you find unsolvable.
											You can go to places like Reddit,
and find sub-Reddits,
											like &quot;Ask a Historian&quot; or &quot;Ask Science,&quot;
											where you can ask people
who are in these fields
											a wide range of questions,
											from very serious ones to very silly ones.
											But to me, the most interesting
communities of learners
											that are growing up on the Internet
right now are on YouTube,
											and admittedly, I am biased.
											But I think in a lot of ways,
the YouTube page resembles a classroom.
											Look for instance at &quot;Minute Physics,&quot;

											(Video) Let&#39;s cut to the chase.
											As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson
is the last fundamental piece
											of the standard model of particle physics
to be discovered experimentally.
											But, you might ask,
why was the Higgs boson
											included in the standard model,
											alongside well-known particles
like electrons and photons and quarks,
											if it hadn&#39;t been discovered
back then in the 1970s?
											Good question. There are two main reasons.
											First, just like the electron
is an excitation in the electron field,
											the Higgs boson is simply a particle
which is an excitation
											of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.
											The Higgs field in turn
plays an integral role
											in our model for the weak nuclear force.
											In particular, the Higgs field
helps explain why it&#39;s so weak.
											We&#39;ll talk more about this
in a later video,
											but even though weak nuclear theory was
confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,
											the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled
with the weak force, that until now
											we&#39;ve been unable to confirm
its actual and independent existence.

of course the assassination in Sarajevo

											Quick aside: It&#39;s worth noting

											So Franz Ferdinand
wasn&#39;t particularly well-liked

to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,

war against Serbia.

											(Video) So you&#39;re me, and you&#39;re
in math class yet again,
											because they make you go every single day.
											And you&#39;re learning about, I don&#39;t know,
the sums of infinite series.
											That&#39;s a high school topic, right?
											Which is odd, because it&#39;s a cool topic,
but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.
											So I guess that&#39;s why they allow
infinite series in the curriculum.
											So, in a quite understandable need
for distraction, you&#39;re doodling
											and thinking more about what
the plural of &quot;series&quot; should be
											than about the topic at hand: &quot;serieses,&quot;
&quot;seriese,&quot; &quot;seriesen,&quot; and &quot;serii?&quot;
											Or is it that the singular should be
changed: one &quot;serie,&quot; or &quot;serum,&quot;
											just like the singular of &quot;sheep&quot;
should be &quot;shoop.&quot;
											But the whole concept of things
											like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on
approaches one, is useful if, say,
											you want to draw a line of elephants,
											each holding the tail of the next one:
											normal elephant, young elephant,
baby elephant, dog-sized elephant,
											puppy-sized elephant, all the way
down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.
											Which is at least a tiny bit awesome,

of elephants in a line,

											JG: So, here&#39;s something all four
of these videos have in common:
											They all have more than half
a million views on YouTube.
											And those are people watching
not in classrooms,
											but because they are part
of the communities of learning
											that are being set up by these channels.
											And I said earlier that YouTube
is like a classroom to me,

because here is the instructor —
											it&#39;s like the old-fashioned classroom:
here&#39;s the instructor,
											and then beneath the instructor
are the students,
											and they&#39;re all having a conversation.
											And I know that YouTube comments
have a very bad reputation
											in the world of the Internet,
											but in fact, if you go on comments
for these channels,
											what you&#39;ll find is people engaging
the subject matter,
											asking difficult, complicated questions
that are about the subject matter,
											and then other people
answering those questions.
											And because the YouTube page is set up so
that the page in which I&#39;m talking to you
											is on the exact — the place where I&#39;m
talking to you is on the exact same page
											as your comments,
											you are participating in a live and real

											I really believe that these spaces,
											these communities, have become
for a new generation of learners,
											the kind of communities,
the kind of cartographic communities
											that I had when I was in high school,
and then again when I was in college.
											And as an adult, re-finding
these communities
											has re-introduced me
to a community of learners,
											and has encouraged me to continue
to be a learner even in my adulthood,
											so that I no longer feel like learning
is something reserved for the young.
											Vi Hart and &quot;Minute Physics&quot; introduced me
											to all kinds of things
that I didn&#39;t know before.
											And I know that we all hearken back
											to the days of the Parisian salon
in the Enlightenment,
											or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,
											&quot;Oh, I wish I could have been
a part of that,
											I wish I could have laughed
at Dorothy Parker&#39;s jokes.&quot;
											But I&#39;m here to tell you that these places
exist, they still exist.
											They exist in corners of the Internet,
where old men fear to tread.
