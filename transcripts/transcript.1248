											Like many of you, I&#39;m one of the lucky people.
											I was born to a family where education was pervasive.
											I&#39;m a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.
											In my childhood, I played around in my father&#39;s university lab.
											So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities,
											which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.
									</p>

									<p>
											Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.
											In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa,
											education is just not readily accessible.
											In South Africa, the educational system was constructed
											in the days of apartheid for the white minority.
											And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots
											for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.
											That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year
											at the University of Johannesburg.
											There were a handful of positions left open
											from the standard admissions process, and the night before
											they were supposed to open that for registration,
											thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long,
											hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.
											When the gates opened, there was a stampede,
											and 20 people were injured and one woman died.
											She was a mother who gave her life
											trying to get her son a chance at a better life.

											But even in parts of the world like the United States
											where education is available, it might not be within reach.
											There has been much discussed in the last few years
											about the rising cost of health care.
											What might not be quite as obvious to people
											is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition
											has been increasing at almost twice the rate,
											for a total of 559 percent since 1985.
											This makes education unaffordable for many people.

											Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education,
											the doors of opportunity might not open.
											Only a little over half of recent college graduates
											in the United States who get a higher education
											actually are working in jobs that require that education.
											This, of course, is not true for the students
											who graduate from the top institutions,
											but for many others, they do not get the value
											for their time and their effort.

											Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article,
											captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.
											He said the big breakthroughs are what happen
											when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.
											I&#39;ve talked about what&#39;s desperately necessary.
											Let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s suddenly possible.

											What&#39;s suddenly possible was demonstrated by
											three big Stanford classes,
											each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.
											So to understand this, let&#39;s look at one of those classes,
											the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague
											and cofounder Andrew Ng.
											Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.
											It&#39;s a Machine Learning class,
											and it has 400 people enrolled every time it&#39;s offered.
											When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public,
											it had 100,000 people registered.
											So to put that number in perspective,
											for Andrew to reach that same size audience
											by teaching a Stanford class,
											he would have to do that for 250 years.

											So, having seen the impact of this,
											Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up,
											to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.
											So we formed Coursera,

											from the best instructors at the best universities
											and provide it to everyone around the world for free.
											We currently have 43 courses on the platform
											from four universities across a range of disciplines,

											Let&#39;s talk a little bit about some of the components
											that go into these courses.
											The first component is that when you move away
											from the constraints of a physical classroom
											and design content explicitly for an online format,
											you can break away from, for example,
											the monolithic one-hour lecture.
											You can break up the material, for example,
											into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes,
											each of which represents a coherent concept.
											Students can traverse this material in different ways,
											depending on their background, their skills or their interests.
											So, for example, some students might benefit
											from a little bit of preparatory material
											that other students might already have.
											Other students might be interested in a particular
											enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
											So this format allows us to break away
											from the one-size-fits-all model of education,
											and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Of course, we all know as educators
											that students don&#39;t learn by sitting and passively watching videos.
											Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort
											is that we need to have students
											who practice with the material
											in order to really understand it.
											There&#39;s been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.
											This one that appeared in Science last year, for example,
											demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice,
											where students are just supposed to repeat
											what they already learned
											gives considerably improved results
											on various achievement tests down the line
											than many other educational interventions.

									<p>
											We&#39;ve tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform,
											as well as other forms of practice in many ways.
											For example, even our videos are not just videos.
											Every few minutes, the video pauses
											and the students get asked a question.

											So they get to try again,
											and this time they got it right.
											There&#39;s an optional explanation if they want.
											And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.
											This is a kind of simple question
											that I as an instructor might ask in class,
											but when I ask that kind of a question in class,
											80 percent of the students
											are still scribbling the last thing I said,
											15 percent are zoned out on Facebook,
											and then there&#39;s the smarty pants in the front row
											who blurts out the answer
											before anyone else has had a chance to think about it,
											and I as the instructor am terribly gratified
											that somebody actually knew the answer.
											And so the lecture moves on before, really,
											most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.
											Here, every single student
											has to engage with the material.

											And of course these simple retrieval questions
											are not the end of the story.
											One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions,
											and one also needs to provide the students with feedback
											on those questions.
											Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students
											if you do not have 10,000 TAs?
											The answer is, you need to use technology
											to do it for you.
											Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way,
											and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.
											In addition to multiple choice
											and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video,
											we can also grade math, mathematical expressions
											as well as mathematical derivations.
											We can grade models, whether it&#39;s
											financial models in a business class
											or physical models in a science or engineering class
											and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.

									<p>
											Let me show you one that&#39;s actually pretty simple
											but fairly visual.
											This is from Stanford&#39;s Computer Science 101 class,
											and the students are supposed to color-correct
											that blurry red image.
											They&#39;re typing their program into the browser,
											and you can see they didn&#39;t get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.
											And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they&#39;re told that,
											and they can move on to the next assignment.
											This ability to interact actively with the material
											and be told when you&#39;re right or wrong
											is really essential to student learning.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, of course we cannot yet grade
											the range of work that one needs for all courses.
											Specifically, what&#39;s lacking is the kind of critical thinking work
											that is so essential in such disciplines
											as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.
											So we tried to convince, for example,
											some of our humanities faculty
											that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.
											That didn&#39;t go over really well.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we had to come up with a different solution.
											And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.
											It turns out that previous studies show,
											like this one by Saddler and Good,
											that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy
											for providing reproducible grades.
											It was tried only in small classes,
											but there it showed, for example,
											that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis
											are actually very well correlated
											with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.
											What&#39;s even more surprising is that self-grades,
											where the students grade their own work critically —
											so long as you incentivize them properly
											so they can&#39;t give themselves a perfect score —
											are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.
											And so this is an effective strategy
											that can be used for grading at scale,
											and is also a useful learning strategy for the students,
											because they actually learn from the experience.
											So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised,
											where tens of thousands of students
											are grading each other&#39;s work,
											and quite successfully, I have to say.

											But this is not just about students
											sitting alone in their living room working through problems.
											Around each one of our courses,
											a community of students had formed,
											a global community of people
											around a shared intellectual endeavor.
											What you see here is a self-generated map
											from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course,
											where they have put themselves on a world map,

											Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.
											First of all, there was a question and answer forum,
											where students would pose questions,
											and other students would answer those questions.
											And the really amazing thing is,
											because there were so many students,
											it means that even if a student posed a question
											at 3 o&#39;clock in the morning,
											somewhere around the world,
											there would be somebody who was awake
											and working on the same problem.
											And so, in many of our courses,
											the median response time for a question

											And you can see from the student testimonials
											that students actually find

											Students also self-assembled,
											without any kind of intervention from us,
											into small study groups.
											Some of these were physical study groups
											along geographical constraints
											and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.
											This is the San Francisco study group,
											but there were ones all over the world.
											Others were virtual study groups,
											sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines,

											There are some tremendous opportunities
											to be had from this kind of framework.
											The first is that it has the potential of giving us
											a completely unprecedented look
											into understanding human learning.
											Because the data that we can collect here is unique.
											You can collect every click, every homework submission,
											every forum post from tens of thousands of students.
											So you can turn the study of human learning
											from the hypothesis-driven mode
											to the data-driven mode, a transformation that,
											for example, has revolutionized biology.
											You can use these data to understand fundamental questions
											like, what are good learning strategies
											that are effective versus ones that are not?
											And in the context of particular courses,
											you can ask questions
											like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common
											and how do we help students fix them?

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So here&#39;s an example of that,
											also from Andrew&#39;s Machine Learning class.
											This is a distribution of wrong answers
											to one of Andrew&#39;s assignments.
											The answers happen to be pairs of numbers,
											so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.
											Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.
											The big cross at the top left
											is where 2,000 students
											gave the exact same wrong answer.
											Now, if two students in a class of 100
											give the same wrong answer,
											you would never notice.
											But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer,
											it&#39;s kind of hard to miss.
											So Andrew and his students went in,
											looked at some of those assignments,
											understood the root cause of the misconception,
											and then they produced a targeted error message
											that would be provided to every student
											whose answer fell into that bucket,
											which means that students who made that same mistake
											would now get personalized feedback
											telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.

											So this personalization is something that one can then build
											by having the virtue of large numbers.
											Personalization is perhaps
											one of the biggest opportunities here as well,
											because it provides us with the potential
											of solving a 30-year-old problem.
											Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984,
											posed what&#39;s called the 2 sigma problem,
											which he observed by studying three populations.
											The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.
											The second is a population of students that studied
											using a standard lecture-based classroom,
											but with a mastery-based approach,
											so the students couldn&#39;t move on to the next topic
											before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.
											And finally, there was a population of students
											that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.
											The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation,
											or sigma, in achievement scores better
											than the standard lecture-based class,
											and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma
											improvement in performance.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											To understand what that means,
											let&#39;s look at the lecture-based classroom,
											and let&#39;s pick the median performance as a threshold.
											So in a lecture-based class,
											half the students are above that level and half are below.
											In the individual tutoring instruction,
											98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.
											Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students
											would be above average.
											Hence, the 2 sigma problem.

											Because we cannot afford, as a society,
											to provide every student with an individual human tutor.
											But maybe we can afford to provide each student
											with a computer or a smartphone.
											So the question is, how can we use technology
											to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve,
											to the right side with the green curve?
											Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer,
											because a computer doesn&#39;t get tired
											of showing you the same video five times.
											And it doesn&#39;t even get tired of grading the same work multiple times,
											we&#39;ve seen that in many of the examples that I&#39;ve shown you.
											And even personalization
											is something that we&#39;re starting to see the beginnings of,
											whether it&#39;s via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum
											or some of the personalized feedback that we&#39;ve shown you.
											So the goal here is to try and push,
											and see how far we can get towards the green curve.

											So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?
											Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.
											He said that, &quot;College is a place where a professor&#39;s lecture notes
											go straight to the students&#39; lecture notes,
											without passing through the brains of either.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.
											I think what he was complaining about is not
											universities but rather the lecture-based format
											that so many universities spend so much time on.
											So let&#39;s go back even further, to Plutarch,
											who said that, &quot;The mind is not a vessel that needs filling,
											but wood that needs igniting.&quot;
											And maybe we should spend less time at universities
											filling our students&#39; minds with content
											by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity,
											their imagination and their problem-solving skills
											by actually talking with them.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So how do we do that?
											We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.
											So there&#39;s been many studies, including this one,
											that show that if you use active learning,
											interacting with your students in the classroom,
											performance improves on every single metric —
											on attendance, on engagement and on learning
											as measured by a standardized test.
											You can see, for example, that the achievement score
											almost doubles in this particular experiment.
											So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education
											to everyone around the world for free,
											what would that do? Three things.
											First it would establish education as a fundamental human right,
											where anyone around the world
											with the ability and the motivation
											could get the skills that they need
											to make a better life for themselves,
											their families and their communities.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Second, it would enable lifelong learning.
											It&#39;s a shame that for so many people,
											learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.
											By having this amazing content be available,
											we would be able to learn something new
											every time we wanted,
											whether it&#39;s just to expand our minds
											or it&#39;s to change our lives.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation,
											because amazing talent can be found anywhere.
											Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs
											is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.
											And if we could offer that person an education,
											they would be able to come up with the next big idea
											and make the world a better place for all of us.
