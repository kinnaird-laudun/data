											I&#39;d like to take you to another world.
											And I&#39;d like to share
											a 45 year-old love story
											with the poor,
											living on less than one dollar a day.
											I went to a very elitist, snobbish,
											expensive education in India,
											and that almost destroyed me.
											I was all set
											to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor —
											all laid out.
											Then, I don&#39;t look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion
											for three years.
											(Laughter)
											The whole world was laid out for me.
											Everything was at my feet.
											I could do nothing wrong.
											And then I thought out of curiosity
											I&#39;d like to go and live and work
											and just see what a village is like.

											So in 1965,
											I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,
											and I saw starvation, death,
											people dying of hunger, for the first time.
											It changed my life.
											I came back home,
											told my mother,
											&quot;I&#39;d like to live and work in a village.&quot;
											Mother went into a coma.
											(Laughter)
											&quot;What is this?
											The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,
											and you want to go and work in a village?
											I mean, is there something wrong with you?&quot;
											I said, &quot;No, I&#39;ve got the best eduction.
											It made me think.
											And I wanted to give something back
											in my own way.&quot;
											&quot;What do you want to do in a village?
											No job, no money,
											no security, no prospect.&quot;
											I said, &quot;I want to live
											and dig wells for five years.&quot;
											&quot;Dig wells for five years?
											You went to the most expensive school and college in India,
											and you want to dig wells for five years?&quot;
											She didn&#39;t speak to me for a very long time,
											because she thought I&#39;d let my family down.

											But then,
											I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills
											that very poor people have,
											which are never brought into the mainstream —
											which is never identified, respected,
											applied on a large scale.
											And I thought I&#39;d start a Barefoot College —
											college only for the poor.
											What the poor thought was important
											would be reflected in the college.
											I went to this village for the first time.
											Elders came to me
											and said, &quot;Are you running from the police?&quot;
											I said, &quot;No.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											&quot;You failed in your exam?&quot;
											I said, &quot;No.&quot;
											&quot;You didn&#39;t get a government job?&quot; I said, &quot;No.&quot;
											&quot;What are you doing here?
											Why are you here?
											The education system in India
											makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;
											what are you doing in this village?
											Is there something wrong with you you&#39;re not telling us?&quot;
											I said, &quot;No, I want to actually start a college
											only for the poor.
											What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college.&quot;

									<p>
											So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.
											They said, &quot;Please,
											don&#39;t bring anyone with a degree and qualification
											into your college.&quot;
											So it&#39;s the only college in India
											where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master&#39;s,
											you are disqualified to come.
											You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout
											to come to our college.
											You have to work with your hands.
											You have to have a dignity of labor.
											You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community
											and provide a service to the community.
											So we started the Barefoot College,
											and we redefined professionalism.

											Who is a professional?
											A professional is someone

											confidence and belief.
											A water diviner is a professional.
											A traditional midwife
											is a professional.
											A traditional bone setter is a professional.
											These are professionals all over the world.
											You find them in any inaccessible village around the world.
											And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream
											and show that the knowledge and skills that they have
											is universal.
											It needs to be used, needs to be applied,
											needs to be shown to the world outside —
											that these knowledge and skills

											So when I said that,

											This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can&#39;t show it on the ground.&quot;
											So we built the first Barefoot College
											in 1986.
											It was built by 12 Barefoot architects
											who can&#39;t read and write,
											built on $1.50 a sq. ft.
											150 people lived there, worked there.
											They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.

These &ldquo;barefoot solutions&rdquo; can be broadly categorized into solar energy, water, education, health care, rural handicrafts, people&rsquo;s action, communication, women&rsquo;s empowerment and wasteland development. The Barefoot College education program, for instance, teaches literacy and also skills, encouraging learning-by-doing. (Literacy is only part of it.)&nbsp; Bunker&rsquo;s organization has also successfully trained grandmothers from Africa and the Himalayan region to be solar engineers so they can bring electricity to their remote villages.</p><p>As he says, Barefoot College is &quot;a place of learning and unlearning: where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher.&quot;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Bunker Roy","tags":["culture","education","global issues","india","invention","women","global development"],"title":"Learning from a barefoot movement","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":3708809}]}
