											There are more Chinese
restaurants in this country
											than McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, Kentucky
Fried Chicken and Wendy&#39;s, combined —
											40,000, actually.
											Chinese restaurants have played
an important role in American history,
											as a matter of fact.
											The Cuban missile crisis was resolved
in a Chinese restaurant
											called Yenching Palace in Washington, DC,
											which unfortunately is closed now,
											and about to be turned into Walgreen&#39;s.
											And the house where John Wilkes Booth
											planned the assassination
of Abraham Lincoln
											is also now a Chinese restaurant
called Wok and Roll,
											on H Street in Washington.

											And it&#39;s not completely gratuitous,
											because &quot;wok&quot; and &quot;roll&quot; —
Chinese food and Japanese foods,
											so it kind of works out.
											And Americans love
their Chinese food so much,
											they&#39;ve actually brought it into space.
											NASA, for example, serves
thermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork
											on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.

											So, let me present the question to you:
											If our benchmark
for Americanness is apple pie,

how often do you eat apple pie,
											versus how often do you eat Chinese food?

											And if you think about it,
											a lot of the foods that we or Americans
think of as Chinese food
											are barely recognizable to Chinese.
											For example: beef with broccoli,
egg rolls, General Tso&#39;s Chicken,
											fortune cookies, chop suey,
the take-out boxes.
											For example, I took a whole bunch
of fortune cookies back to China,
											gave them to Chinese
to see how they would react.

											So where are they from?
											The short answer is, actually,
they&#39;re from Japan.
											And in Kyoto, outside, there are still
small family-run bakeries
											that make fortune cookies,
as they did over 100 years ago,
											30 years before fortune cookies
were introduced in the United States.
											If you see them side by side,
											there&#39;s yellow and brown.
											Theirs are actually flavored
with miso and sesame paste,
											so they&#39;re not as sweet as our version.
											So how did they get to the US?
											Well, the short answer is,
the Japanese immigrants came over,
											and a bunch of the bakers
introduced them —
											including at least one in Los Angeles,
											and one here in San Francisco,
called Benkyodo,
											which is on the corner
of Sutter and Buchanan.
											Back then, they made fortune cookies
using very much the similar kind of irons
											that we saw back in Kyoto.

											The interesting question is:
											How do you go from fortune cookies
being something that is Japanese
											to being something that is Chinese?
											Well, we locked up all the Japanese
during World War II,

											So that&#39;s when the Chinese moved in,
											saw a market opportunity and took over.

											I showed them the pictures
of General Tso Chicken,
											and they were like,
											&quot;We don&#39;t know this dish.
Is this Chinese food?&quot;
											Because it doesn&#39;t look
like Chinese food to them.
											But they weren&#39;t surprised I traveled
around the world to visit them,

who thought he was the son of God

											But the granddaddy
of all the Chinese American dishes
											we probably ought to talk
about is chop suey,
											which was introduced
around the turn of the 20th century.
											According to the New York Times in 1904,
											there was an outbreak
of Chinese restaurants all over town,
											and &quot;... the city has gone
&#39;chop suey&#39; mad.&quot;
											So it took about 30 years
before the Americans realized
											that chop suey is actually
not known in China,
											and as this article points out,
											&quot;The average native of any city in China
knows nothing of chop suey.&quot;
											Back then it was a way to show
you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan;
											a guy who wanted to impress a girl
could take her on a chop suey date.
											I like to say chop suey
is the biggest culinary joke
											one culture ever played on another,
											because &quot;chop suey,&quot;
translated into Chinese,
											means &quot;jaahp-seui,&quot; which, translated
back, means &quot;odds and ends.&quot;
											So, these people are going
around China asking for chop suey,
											which is sort of like a Japanese guy
coming here and saying,
											&quot;I understand you have
a very popular dish in your country
											called &#39;leftovers.&#39;&quot;

											So, why and where did chop suey come from?
											Let&#39;s go back to the mid-1800s,
											when the Chinese first came to America.
											Back then, Americans were not
clamoring to eat Chinese food.
											In fact, they saw these people
who landed at their shores as alien.
											These people weren&#39;t eating dogs,
they were eating cats.
											If they weren&#39;t eating cats,
they were eating rats.
											In fact, The New York Times,
my esteemed employer,
											in 1883 ran an article that asked,
											&quot;Do Chinese eat rats?&quot;
											Not the most PC question
to be asked today,
											but if you look at the popular
imagery of the time,
											not so outlandish.
											This is actually a real
advertisement for rat poison
											from the late 1800s.
											And if you see under the word
&quot;Clears&quot; — very small —
											it says, &quot;They must go,&quot;
which refers not only to the rats,
											but to the Chinese in their midst,
											because the way
that the food was perceived
											was that these people who ate
foods different from us
											must be different from us.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Another way that you saw
this antipathy towards the Chinese
											is through documents like this.
											This is in the Library of Congress.
											It&#39;s a pamphlet published
by Samuel Gompers,
											hero of our American labor movement.
											It&#39;s called, &quot;Some Reason
for Chinese Exclusion:
											Meat versus Rice: American Manhood
against Asiatic Coolieism:
											Which shall survive?&quot;
											And it basically made the argument
											that Chinese men who ate rice
											would necessarily bring down
the standard of living
											for American men who ate meat.
											And as a matter of fact, then,
											this is one of the reasons
we must exclude them from this country.
											So, with sentiments like these,
											the Chinese Exclusion Act
was passed between 1882 and 1902,
											the only time in American history
											when a group was specifically excluded
											for its national origin or ethnicity.
											So in a way, because
the Chinese were attacked,
											chop suey was created
as a defense mechanism.

											Who came up with the idea of chop suey?
											There&#39;s a lot of different
mysteries and legends,
											but of the ones I&#39;ve found,
											the most interesting
is this article from 1904.
											A Chinese guy named Lem Sen
											shows up in Chinatown,
New York City, and says,
											&quot;I want you all to stop making chop suey,
											because I am the original creator
and sole proprietor of chop suey.
											And the way he tells it,
											there was a famous Chinese
diplomat that showed up,
											and he was told to make a dish
that looked very popular
											and could, quote, &quot;pass&quot; as Chinese.
											And as he said —
we would never print this today —
											but basically, the American man
has become very rich.
											Lem Sen: &quot;I would&#39;ve made this money, too,
but I spent all this time
											looking for the American man
who stole my recipe.
											Now I&#39;ve found him
and I want my recipe back,
											and I want everyone
to stop making chop suey,
											or pay me for the right to do the same.
											So it was an early exercise
of intellectual property rights.

											The thing is, this idea
of Chinese-American food
											doesn&#39;t exist only in America.
											In fact, Chinese food
is the most pervasive food on the planet,
											served on all seven continents,
even Antarctica,
											because Monday night is Chinese
food night at McMurdo Station,
											which is the main scientific
station in Antarctica.
											You see different varieties
of Chinese food.
											For example, there is French Chinese food,
											where they serve
salt and pepper frog legs.
											There is Italian Chinese food,
where they don&#39;t have fortune cookies,
											so they serve fried gelato.
											My neighbor, Alessandra,
was shocked when I told her,
											&quot;Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese.&quot;
											She&#39;s like, &quot;It&#39;s not? But they serve it
in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy.&quot;

											McDonald&#39;s has garnered
a lot of attention, a lot of respect,

decor and dining experience

											They did so through a centralized
headquarters out of Illinois.
											Chinese restaurants have done largely
the same thing, I would argue,

even the restaurant name,
											but without a centralized headquarters.
											So, this actually became very clear to me
											with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,

											to have three or four
second-place winners,
											people who match
five or six Powerball numbers.

											Yeah. So I went and started looking.
											I went across the country,
looking for these restaurants
											where these people had gotten
their fortune cookies from.
											There are a bunch of them,
including Lee&#39;s China in Omaha —
											which is actually run by Koreans,
but that&#39;s another point,
											and a bunch of them named &quot;China Buffet.&quot;
											What&#39;s interesting is that their stories
were similar, but different.
											It was lunch, it was take-out,
it was sit-down, it was buffet,
											it was three weeks ago,
it was three months ago.
											But at some point, all these people
had a very similar experience
											that converged at a fortune cookie
and a Chinese restaurant.
											And all these restaurants
were serving fortune cookies,
											which, of course,
aren&#39;t even Chinese to begin with.
											It&#39;s part of the phenomenon
I called &quot;spontaneous self-organization,&quot;
											where, like in ant colonies,
little decisions made on the micro level
											actually have a big impact
on the macro level.

									<p>
											A good contrast is Chicken McNuggets.
											McDonald&#39;s actually spent 10 years
coming out with a chicken-like product.
											They did chicken pot pie, fried chicken,
and finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.
											And the great innovation of Chicken
McNuggets was not nuggifying them,
											that&#39;s kind of an easy concept.
											The trick was, they were able
to remove the chicken from the bone
											in a cost-efficient manner,
											which is why it took so long
for people to copy them — 10 years,
											then within a couple months,
it was such a hit,
											they introduced it across the entire
McDonald&#39;s system in the country.

											In contrast is General Tso&#39;s Chicken,
											which actually started
in New York City in the early 1970s,
											as I was also started in this universe
in New York City in the early 1970s.

									<p>
											And this logo!
											So me, General Tso&#39;s Chicken
and this logo are all karmicly related.
											But that dish also took about 10 years
to spread across America
											from a restaurant in New York City.
											Someone&#39;s like, &quot;It&#39;s sweet,
it&#39;s fried, it&#39;s chicken —
											Americans will love this.&quot;

									<p>
											So what I like to say,
this being Bay Area, Silicon Valley,
											is that we think of McDonald&#39;s as sort
of the Microsoft of dining experiences.
											We can think of Chinese
restaurants perhaps as Linux,
											sort of an open-source thing, right?

									<p>
											Where ideas from one person
can be copied and propagated
											across the entire system,
											that there can be specialized
versions of Chinese food,
											depending on the region.
											For example, in New Orleans
we have Cajun Chinese food,
											where they serve Sichuan alligator
and sweet and sour crawfish.
											And in Philadelphia,
you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll,
											which is like an egg roll on the outside
and cheesesteak on the inside.
											I was surprised to discover that not only
in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta.
											What had happened was,
											a Chinese family had moved
from Philadelphia to Atlanta,
											and brought that with them.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the thing is,
											our historical lore,
because of the way we like narratives,
											is full of vast characters,
such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks
											and Ray Kroc with McDonald&#39;s
											and Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.
											But, you know, it&#39;s very easy
to overlook the smaller characters.
											For example, Lem Sen,
who introduced chop suey,
											Chef Peng, who introduced
General Tso&#39;s Chicken,
											and all the Japanese bakers
who introduced fortune cookies.
											So, the point of my presentation
is to make you think twice;
											that those whose names
are forgotten in history
											can often have had as much, if not more,
											impact on what we eat today.
