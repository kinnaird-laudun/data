<title>António Guterres: Refugees have the right to be protected | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: António Guterres thinks that we can solve the global refugee crisis -- and he offers compelling, surprising reasons why we must try. In conversation with TED&#39;s Bruno Giussani, Guterres discusses the historical causes of the current crisis and outlines the mood of the European countries that are trying to screen, shelter and resettle hundreds of thousands of desperate families. Bigger picture: Guterres calls for a multilateral turn toward acceptance and respect -- to defy groups like ISIS&#39;s anti-refugee propaganda and recruiting machine." />

<meta content="António Guterres thinks that we can solve the global refugee crisis — and he offers compelling, surprising reasons why we must try. In conversation with TED's Bruno Giussani, Guterres discusses the historical causes of the current crisis and outlines the mood of the European countries that are trying to screen, shelter and resettle hundreds of thousands of desperate families. Bigger picture: Guterres calls for a multilateral turn toward acceptance and respect — to defy groups like ISIS's anti-refugee propaganda and recruiting machine." itemprop='description'>

											BG: Let&#39;s start with a figure.
											During 2015, almost one million refugees
and migrants arrived in Europe
											from many different countries,
											of course, from Syria and Iraq,
but also from Afghanistan
											and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere.
											And there have been reactions
of two different kinds:
											welcoming parties and border fences.
											But I want to look at it a little bit
											from the short-term
and the long-term perspective.
											And the first question is very simple:
											Why has the movement of refugees
spiked so fast in the last six months?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											AG: Well, I think, basically,
what triggered this huge increase
											was the Syrian refugee group.
											There has been an increased movement
into Europe from Africa, from Asia,
											but slowly growing, and all of a sudden
we had this massive increase
											in the first months of this year.
											Why? I think there are three reasons,
											two long-term ones and the trigger.
											The long-term ones,
in relation to Syrians,
											is that hope is less and less
clear for people.
											I mean, they look at their own country
											and they don&#39;t see much hope
to go back home,
											because there is no political solution,
											so there is no light
at the end of the tunnel.
											Second, the living conditions
											of the Syrians in the neighboring
countries have been deteriorating.
											We just had research with the World Bank,
											and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan
											and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon
											live below the national poverty lines.
											Only half of the children go to school,
											which means that people
are living very badly.
											Not only are they refugees, out of home,
											not only have they suffered
what they have suffered,
											but they are living in very,
very dramatic conditions.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then the trigger
was when all of a sudden,
											international aid decreased.
											The World Food Programme was forced,
for lack of resources,
											to cut by 30 percent food support
to the Syrian refugees.
											They&#39;re not allowed to work,
											so they are totally dependent
on international support,
											and they felt, &quot;The world
is abandoning us.&quot;
											And that, in my opinion, was the trigger.
											All of a sudden, there was a rush,
											and people started to move
in large numbers
											and, to be absolutely honest,
											if I had been in the same situation
											and I would have been brave
enough to do it,
											I think I would have done the same.

you don&#39;t want to recognize the reality.

the capacity to make them.
											And the proof is that even when
the spike occurred,
											Europe remained divided

a mechanism to manage the situation.
											You talk about one million people.
											It looks enormous,

is 550 million people,

											Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee
per three Lebanese.

addressing the root causes,

points need to be massively supported,

of each country.

											to the failure of what should have been
a much stronger investment
											in creating the conditions for people
to live together and respect each other.
											For me it is clear.

											For me it is clear that all societies
will be multiethnic, multicultural,
											multi-religious in the future.
											To try to avoid it is,
in my opinion, impossible.
											And for me it&#39;s a good thing
that they will be like that,

for that to work properly,
											you need a huge investment
											in the social cohesion
of your own societies.

failed in that investment

											AG: Well, look:
											In 2005, we were helping
one million people go back home
											in safety and dignity,
because conflicts had ended.
											Last year, we helped 124,000.
											In 2005, we had about 38 million people
displaced by conflict in the world.
											Today, we have more than 60 million.
											At that time, we had had, recently,
											some conflicts that were solved.
											Now, we see a multiplication
of new conflicts
											and the old conflicts never died:
											Afghanistan, Somalia,
Democratic Republic of Congo.
											It is clear that the world today
is much more dangerous than it was.
											It is clear that the capacity
of the international community
											to prevent conflicts
and to timely solve them,
											is, unfortunately, much worse
than what it was 10 years ago.
											There are no clear
power relations in the world,
											no global governance mechanisms that work,
											which means that we live in a situation
											where impunity and unpredictability
tend to prevail, and that means
											that more and more people suffer,
											namely those that are
displaced by conflicts.

In October 2016 the United Nations Security Council announced he would be the next United Nations Secretary General, succeeding the retiring Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p class=\"p1\">As High Commissioner, he heads one of the world&#39;s foremost humanitarian organizations. UNHCR has twice won the Nobel Peace Prize. Its over 9,300 staff members work in 123 countries providing protection and assistance to nearly 55 million refugees, returnees, internally displaced people and stateless persons. Some 88 percent of UNHCR staff work in the field, often in difficult and dangerous duty stations.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Before joining UNHCR, Guterres spent more than 20 years in government and public service. He served as Portuguese prime minister from 1995 to 2002, during which time he was heavily involved in the international effort to resolve the crisis in East Timor. As president of the European Council in early 2000, he led the adoption of the so-called Lisbon Agenda and co-chaired the first European Union-Africa summit. He also founded the Portuguese Refugee Council in 1991 and was part of the Council of State of Portugal from 1991 to 2002.</p> <p class=\"p1\">From 1981 to 1983, Guterres was a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, as well as chairman of the Committee on Demography, Migration and Refugees. In addition, he has been active in Socialist International, a worldwide organization of social democratic political parties. He was the group&#39;s vice-president from 1992 to 1999 and president from 1999 until mid-2005.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Guterres was born on April 30, 1949, in Lisbon and educated at the Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico, where he remains a visiting professor. He is married and has two children.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/antonio_guterres_refugees_have_the_right_to_be_protected","viewed_count":1139030,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"António Guterres thinks that we can solve the global refugee crisis -- and he offers compelling, surprising reasons why we must try.

In October 2016 the United Nations Security Council announced he would be the next United Nations Secretary General, succeeding the retiring Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p class=\"p1\">As High Commissioner, he heads one of the world&#39;s foremost humanitarian organizations. UNHCR has twice won the Nobel Peace Prize. Its over 9,300 staff members work in 123 countries providing protection and assistance to nearly 55 million refugees, returnees, internally displaced people and stateless persons. Some 88 percent of UNHCR staff work in the field, often in difficult and dangerous duty stations.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Before joining UNHCR, Guterres spent more than 20 years in government and public service. He served as Portuguese prime minister from 1995 to 2002, during which time he was heavily involved in the international effort to resolve the crisis in East Timor. As president of the European Council in early 2000, he led the adoption of the so-called Lisbon Agenda and co-chaired the first European Union-Africa summit. He also founded the Portuguese Refugee Council in 1991 and was part of the Council of State of Portugal from 1991 to 2002.</p> <p class=\"p1\">From 1981 to 1983, Guterres was a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, as well as chairman of the Committee on Demography, Migration and Refugees. In addition, he has been active in Socialist International, a worldwide organization of social democratic political parties. He was the group&#39;s vice-president from 1992 to 1999 and president from 1999 until mid-2005.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Guterres was born on April 30, 1949, in Lisbon and educated at the Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico, where he remains a visiting professor. He is married and has two children.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"António Guterres","tags":["Europe","future","government","global issues","immigration","humanity","interview","policy","society","social change","terrorism"],"title":"Refugees have the right to be protected","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1139030}]}
