											The survey that I quoted,

by socio-economic class or education,

of the literature,
											Bell concludes that, I quote —
&quot;Of 43 studies carried out since 1927

between religious belief,
											and one&#39;s intelligence
or educational level,
											all but four found an inverse connection.
											That is, the higher one&#39;s intelligence
or educational level,
											the less one is likely to be religious.&quot;
											Well, I haven&#39;t seen
the original 42 studies,
											and I can&#39;t comment on that meta-analysis,
											but I would like to see more
studies done along those lines.
											And I know that there are —

											In 1998, Larson and Witham
polled the cream of American scientists,

to a shattering seven percent.

about the nature of the universe,

that there&#39;s definitely no God,

											When atheists like Stephen Hawking

											they use it of course
as a metaphorical shorthand

											&quot;Non-theist&quot; will do for all that,

											it doesn&#39;t have the same
phobic, hysterical responses.
											But I think, actually, the alternative
											is to grasp the nettle
of the word &quot;atheism&quot; itself,
											precisely because it is a taboo word,
											carrying frissons of hysterical phobia.
											Critical mass may be harder
to achieve with the word &quot;atheist&quot;

											Now, I said that if I were religious,
I&#39;d be very afraid of evolution —
											I&#39;d go further: I would fear science
in general, if properly understood.
											And this is because
the scientific worldview
											is so much more exciting, more poetic,
											more filled with sheer wonder
											than anything in the poverty-stricken
arsenals of the religious imagination.
											As Carl Sagan, another recently
dead hero, put it,
											&quot;How is it that hardly any major
religion has looked at science
											and concluded, &#39;This
is better than we thought!
											The universe is much bigger
than our prophet said,
											grander, more subtle, more elegant&#39;?
											Instead they say, &#39;No, no, no!
											My god is a little god,
and I want him to stay that way.&#39;
											A religion, old or new,
											that stressed the magnificence
of the universe
											as revealed by modern science,
											might be able to draw forth
reserves of reverence and awe
											hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.&quot;

											Now, this is an elite audience,
											and I would therefore expect
about 10 percent of you to be religious.
											Many of you probably subscribe
to our polite cultural belief
											that we should respect religion.
											But I also suspect
that a fair number of those
											secretly despise religion as much as I do.

											If you&#39;re one of them, and of course
many of you may not be,
											but if you are one of them,
											I&#39;m asking you to stop being polite,
											come out, and say so.
											And if you happen to be rich,
											give some thought to ways
in which you might make a difference.
											The religious lobby in this country
											is massively financed by foundations —
to say nothing of all the tax benefits —
											by foundations, such as the Templeton
Foundation and the Discovery Institute.
											We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.
											If my books sold as well

Richard Dawkins&#39; books, I&#39;d do it myself.

In recent years, his devastating critique of religion has made him a leading figure in the New Atheism.","whylisten":"<p>As an evolutionary biologist, Richard Dawkins has broadened our understanding of the genetic origin of our species; as a popular author, he has helped lay readers understand complex scientific concepts. He&#39;s best-known for the ideas laid out in his landmark book <a href=\"http://geni.us/selfishgene\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Selfish Gene</em></a>  and fleshed out in <a href=\"http://geni.us/extendedphenotype\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Extended Phenotype</em></a>: the rather radical notion that <strong>Darwinian selection happens not at the level of the individual, but at the level of our DNA</strong>. The implication: We evolved for only one purpose &mdash; to serve our genes.<br /><br />Of perhaps equal importance is Dawkins&#39; concept of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme\" target=\"_blank\">meme</a>, which he defines as a self-replicating unit of culture -- an idea, a chain letter, a catchy tune, an urban legend -- which is passed person-to-person, its longevity based on its ability to lodge in the brain and inspire transmission to others. Introduced in <em>The Selfish Gene</em> in 1976, <strong>the concept of memes has itself proven highly contagious, inspiring countless accounts and explanations of idea propagation</strong> in the information age.<br /><br />In recent years, <strong>Dawkins has become outspoken in his atheism</strong>, coining the word &quot;bright&quot; (as an alternate to atheist), and encouraging fellow non-believers to stand up and be identified. His controversial, confrontational 2002 TED talk was a seminal moment for the New Atheism, as was the publication of his 2006 book, <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/goddelusion\" target=\"_blank\">The God Delusion</a>,</em> a bestselling critique of religion that championed atheism and promoted scientific principles over creationism and intelligent design.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism","viewed_count":4545599,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"Richard Dawkins urges all atheists to openly state their position -- and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science.

In recent years, his devastating critique of religion has made him a leading figure in the New Atheism.","whylisten":"<p>As an evolutionary biologist, Richard Dawkins has broadened our understanding of the genetic origin of our species; as a popular author, he has helped lay readers understand complex scientific concepts. He&#39;s best-known for the ideas laid out in his landmark book <a href=\"http://geni.us/selfishgene\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Selfish Gene</em></a>  and fleshed out in <a href=\"http://geni.us/extendedphenotype\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Extended Phenotype</em></a>: the rather radical notion that <strong>Darwinian selection happens not at the level of the individual, but at the level of our DNA</strong>. The implication: We evolved for only one purpose &mdash; to serve our genes.<br /><br />Of perhaps equal importance is Dawkins&#39; concept of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme\" target=\"_blank\">meme</a>, which he defines as a self-replicating unit of culture -- an idea, a chain letter, a catchy tune, an urban legend -- which is passed person-to-person, its longevity based on its ability to lodge in the brain and inspire transmission to others. Introduced in <em>The Selfish Gene</em> in 1976, <strong>the concept of memes has itself proven highly contagious, inspiring countless accounts and explanations of idea propagation</strong> in the information age.<br /><br />In recent years, <strong>Dawkins has become outspoken in his atheism</strong>, coining the word &quot;bright&quot; (as an alternate to atheist), and encouraging fellow non-believers to stand up and be identified. His controversial, confrontational 2002 TED talk was a seminal moment for the New Atheism, as was the publication of his 2006 book, <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/goddelusion\" target=\"_blank\">The God Delusion</a>,</em> a bestselling critique of religion that championed atheism and promoted scientific principles over creationism and intelligent design.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Richard Dawkins","tags":["God","atheism","culture","religion","science"],"title":"Militant atheism","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":4545599}]}
