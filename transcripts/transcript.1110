											When I was nine years old,
											I went off to summer camp
for the first time.
											And my mother packed me a suitcase
full of books,
											which to me seemed like
a perfectly natural thing to do.
											Because in my family,
reading was the primary group activity.
											And this might sound antisocial to you,
											but for us it was really just
a different way of being social.
											You have the animal warmth of your family
sitting right next to you,
											but you are also free to go
roaming around the adventureland
											inside your own mind.
											And I had this idea
											that camp was going to be
just like this, but better.

											Camp was more like a keg party
without any alcohol.
											And on the very first day,
											our counselor gathered us all together
											and she taught us a cheer
that she said we would be doing
											every day for the rest of the summer
to instill camp spirit.
											And it went like this:
											&quot;R-O-W-D-I-E,
											that&#39;s the way we spell rowdie.
											Rowdie, rowdie, let&#39;s get rowdie.&quot;

this word incorrectly.

											But the first time that I took
my book out of my suitcase,

are you being so mellow?&quot; —
											mellow, of course,
being the exact opposite
											of R-O-W-D-I-E.
											And then the second time I tried it,

for the rest of the summer.
											And I felt kind of guilty about this.
											I felt as if the books needed me somehow,
											and they were calling out to me
and I was forsaking them.
											But I did forsake them
and I didn&#39;t open that suitcase again

											Now, I tell you this story
about summer camp.
											I could have told you
50 others just like it —
											all the times that I got the message
											that somehow my quiet
and introverted style of being
											was not necessarily the right way to go,
											that I should be trying to pass
as more of an extrovert.
											And I always sensed deep down
that this was wrong
											and that introverts were
pretty excellent just as they were.
											But for years I denied this intuition,
											and so I became a Wall Street
lawyer, of all things,
											instead of the writer
that I had always longed to be —
											partly because I needed to prove to myself
that I could be bold and assertive too.
											And I was always going off to crowded bars
											when I really would have preferred
to just have a nice dinner with friends.
											And I made these
self-negating choices so reflexively,
											that I wasn&#39;t even aware
that I was making them.

											Now this is what many introverts do,
											and it&#39;s our loss for sure,
											but it is also our colleagues&#39; loss
											and our communities&#39; loss.
											And at the risk of sounding grandiose,
it is the world&#39;s loss.
											Because when it comes
to creativity and to leadership,
											we need introverts doing
what they do best.
											A third to a half of the population
are introverts —
											a third to a half.
											So that&#39;s one out of every two
or three people you know.
											So even if you&#39;re an extrovert yourself,
											I&#39;m talking about your coworkers
											and your spouses and your children
											and the person sitting
next to you right now —
											all of them subject to this bias
											that is pretty deep
and real in our society.
											We all internalize it
from a very early age
											without even having a language
for what we&#39;re doing.

									<p>
											Now, to see the bias clearly,
											you need to understand
what introversion is.
											It&#39;s different from being shy.
											Shyness is about fear of social judgment.
											Introversion is more about,
											how do you respond to stimulation,
											including social stimulation.
											So extroverts really crave
large amounts of stimulation,
											whereas introverts feel
at their most alive
											and their most switched-on
and their most capable
											when they&#39;re in quieter,
more low-key environments.
											Not all the time —
these things aren&#39;t absolute —
											but a lot of the time.
											So the key then to maximizing our talents
											is for us all to put ourselves
											in the zone of stimulation
that is right for us.

											But now here&#39;s where the bias comes in.
											Our most important institutions,
											our schools and our workplaces,
											they are designed mostly for extroverts
											and for extroverts&#39; need
for lots of stimulation.
											And also we have
this belief system right now
											that I call the new groupthink,
											which holds that all creativity
and all productivity
											comes from a very oddly gregarious place.

											So if you picture the typical
classroom nowadays:
											When I was going to school,
we sat in rows.
											We sat in rows of desks like this,
											and we did most of our work
pretty autonomously.
											But nowadays, your typical classroom
has pods of desks —
											four or five or six or seven kids
all facing each other.
											And kids are working
in countless group assignments.
											Even in subjects like math
and creative writing,
											which you think would depend
on solo flights of thought,
											kids are now expected to act
as committee members.
											And for the kids who prefer to go off
by themselves or just to work alone,
											those kids are seen as outliers often
											or, worse, as problem cases.
											And the vast majority of teachers
											reports believing that
the ideal student is an extrovert
											as opposed to an introvert,
											even though introverts
actually get better grades
											and are more knowledgeable,
											according to research.

											Okay, same thing is true
in our workplaces.
											Now, most of us work in open plan offices,
											without walls,
											where we are subject to the constant
noise and gaze of our coworkers.
											And when it comes to leadership,
											introverts are routinely passed over
for leadership positions,
											even though introverts
tend to be very careful,
											much less likely to take outsize risks —
											which is something
we might all favor nowadays.
											And interesting research
by Adam Grant at the Wharton School
											has found that introverted leaders
											often deliver better outcomes
than extroverts do,
											because when they are managing
proactive employees,
											they&#39;re much more likely to let
those employees run with their ideas,
											whereas an extrovert
can, quite unwittingly,
											get so excited about things
											that they&#39;re putting
their own stamp on things,
											and other people&#39;s ideas might not
as easily then bubble up to the surface.

											Now in fact, some of our transformative
leaders in history have been introverts.
											I&#39;ll give you some examples.
											Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi —
											all these peopled described themselves
as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.
											And they all took the spotlight,
											even though every bone in their bodies
was telling them not to.
											And this turns out to have
a special power all its own,
											because people could feel
that these leaders were at the helm
											not because they enjoyed directing others
											and not out of the pleasure
of being looked at;
											they were there
because they had no choice,
											because they were driven to do
what they thought was right.

											Now I think at this point
it&#39;s important for me to say
											that I actually love extroverts.
											I always like to say some of my best
friends are extroverts,
											including my beloved husband.
											And we all fall
at different points, of course,
											along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.
											Even Carl Jung, the psychologist
who first popularized these terms,
											said that there&#39;s no such thing
as a pure introvert
											or a pure extrovert.
											He said that such a man
would be in a lunatic asylum,
											if he existed at all.
											And some people fall smack in the middle
of the introvert/extrovert spectrum,
											and we call these people ambiverts.
											And I often think that they have
the best of all worlds.
											But many of us do recognize
ourselves as one type or the other.

									<p>
											And what I&#39;m saying is that culturally,
we need a much better balance.
											We need more of a yin and yang
between these two types.
											This is especially important
											when it comes to creativity
and to productivity,
											because when psychologists look
at the lives of the most creative people,
											what they find
											are people who are very good
at exchanging ideas
											and advancing ideas,

streak of introversion in them.

											And this is because solitude
											is a crucial ingredient
often to creativity.
											So Darwin,
											he took long walks alone in the woods
											and emphatically turned down
dinner-party invitations.
											Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,
											he dreamed up many
of his amazing creations
											in a lonely bell tower office that he had
											in the back of his house
in La Jolla, California.
											And he was actually afraid to meet
the young children who read his books
											for fear that they were expecting him
this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure
											and would be disappointed
with his more reserved persona.
											Steve Wozniak invented
the first Apple computer
											sitting alone in his cubicle
in Hewlett-Packard
											where he was working at the time.
											And he says that he never would have
become such an expert in the first place
											had he not been too introverted
to leave the house
											when he was growing up.

											Now, of course,
											this does not mean that we should
all stop collaborating —
											and case in point, is Steve Wozniak
famously coming together with Steve Jobs
											to start Apple Computer —
											but it does mean that solitude matters
											and that for some people
it is the air that they breathe.
											And in fact, we have known for centuries
about the transcendent power of solitude.
											It&#39;s only recently that
we&#39;ve strangely begun to forget it.
											If you look at most
of the world&#39;s major religions,
											you will find seekers —
											Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad —
											seekers who are going off by themselves
alone to the wilderness,
											where they then have profound
epiphanies and revelations
											that they then bring back
to the rest of the community.

											This is no surprise, though,

even be in a group of people

											Even about seemingly

											Now if all this is true,
											then why are we getting it so wrong?
											Why are we setting up our schools
this way, and our workplaces?
											And why are we making
these introverts feel so guilty
											about wanting to just go off
by themselves some of the time?
											One answer lies deep
in our cultural history.
											Western societies,
											and in particular the U.S.,
											have always favored the man of action
over the &quot;man&quot; of contemplation.
											But in America&#39;s early days,
											we lived in what historians
call a culture of character,
											where we still,
at that point, valued people
											for their inner selves
and their moral rectitude.
											And if you look at the self-help
books from this era,
											they all had titles with things like
											&quot;Character, the Grandest
Thing in the World.&quot;
											And they featured role models
like Abraham Lincoln,
											who was praised for being
modest and unassuming.
											Ralph Waldo Emerson called him
											&quot;A man who does not
offend by superiority.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But then we hit the 20th century,
											and we entered a new culture
											that historians call
the culture of personality.
											What happened is we had evolved
an agricultural economy
											to a world of big business.
											And so suddenly people are moving
from small towns to the cities.
											And instead of working alongside people
they&#39;ve known all their lives,
											now they are having to prove themselves
in a crowd of strangers.
											So, quite understandably,
											qualities like magnetism and charisma
suddenly come to seem really important.
											And sure enough, the self-help books
change to meet these new needs
											and they start to have names
											like &quot;How to Win Friends
and Influence People.&quot;
											And they feature as their role models
really great salesmen.
											So that&#39;s the world we&#39;re living in today.
											That&#39;s our cultural inheritance.

that social skills are unimportant,

for the abolishing of teamwork at all.
											The same religions who send their sages

											also teach us love and trust.
											And the problems that we are facing today
											in fields like science and in economics
											are so vast and so complex
											that we are going to need armies
of people coming together
											to solve them working together.
											But I am saying that the more freedom

											with the very same congregation
that he had been speaking to for 62 years.
											And even away from the podium,
											when you called him to say hello,
											he would often end
the conversation prematurely
											for fear that he was taking up
too much of your time.
											But when he died at the age of 94,
											the police had to close down
the streets of his neighborhood
											to accommodate the crowd of people

											And I want to be clear
about what I&#39;m saying,
											because I deeply believe our offices
											should be encouraging casual, chatty
cafe-style types of interactions —
											you know, the kind
where people come together
											and serendipitously have
an exchange of ideas.
											That is great.
											It&#39;s great for introverts
and it&#39;s great for extroverts.
											But we need much more privacy
and much more freedom
											and much more autonomy at work.
											School, same thing.
											We need to be teaching kids
to work together, for sure,
											but we also need to be teaching them
how to work on their own.
											This is especially important
for extroverted children too.
											They need to work on their own
											because that is where deep thought
comes from in part.

											Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.
											Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.
											I&#39;m not saying
											that we all have to now go off and build
our own cabins in the woods

											but I am saying that we could
all stand to unplug
											and get inside our own heads
a little more often.

											Number three:
											Take a good look
at what&#39;s inside your own suitcase
											and why you put it there.
											So extroverts,
											maybe your suitcases
are also full of books.
											Or maybe they&#39;re full of champagne glasses
or skydiving equipment.
											Whatever it is, I hope you take
these things out every chance you get
											and grace us with your energy
and your joy.
											But introverts, you being you,
											you probably have the impulse
to guard very carefully
											what&#39;s inside your own suitcase.
											And that&#39;s okay.
											But occasionally, just occasionally,
											I hope you will open up your suitcases
for other people to see,
											because the world needs you and it
needs the things you carry.

She reaches millions of people through her books, podcasts and her mission-based organization, Quiet Revolution, which empowers introverts for the benefit of everyone.","whylisten":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Susan Cain is a former corporate lawyer and negotiations consultant -- and a self-described introvert. At least one-third of the people we know are introverts, notes Cain in her book&nbsp;<em>QUIET: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#39;t Stop Talking</em>. Although our culture undervalues them dramatically, introverts have made some of the great contributions to society -- from Chopin&#39;s nocturnes to the invention of the personal computer to Ghandi&#39;s transformative leadership. Cain argues that we design our schools, workplaces and religious institutions for extroverts, and that this bias creates a waste of talent, energy and happiness. Based on intensive research in psychology and neurobiology and on prolific interviews, she also explains why introverts are capable of great love and great achievement, not in spite of their temperament -- but because of them.</span></p>  <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2015 Susan Cain announced the launch of her mission-based organization <a href=\"http://www.quietrev.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quiet Revolution</a> that aims to change the lives of introverts by empowering them with the information, tools and resources they need to survive and thrive.</span></p>  <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the workplace, companies are not fully harnessing the talents of their introverted employees and leadership teams are often imbalanced with many more extroverts than introverts. <a href=\"http://qli.quietrev.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Quiet Leadership Institute</a> has worked with companies from LinkedIn to GE to Procter and Gamble to help them achieve their potential by providing learning experiences that unlock the power of introverts.</span></p>  <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the heart and center of the Quiet Revolution is empowering the next generation of children to know their own strengths and be freed from the sense of inadequacy that has shadowed the children of previous generations.

Collins, who was once the US poet laureate, says he’s an extrovert, but if his poems are any indication, he’s a homebody like me. He writes about exciting things like looking up words in the encyclopedia and walking to town for a gallon of milk. He’s charming and insightful, and I love his work so much that when I went into labor with our first child, my husband ran back to our apartment to bring one of Collins’ books to the maternity ward. He thought I should have it while we were waiting for the baby to come. (One of the highlights of speaking at TED was getting to meet [Collins, who also gave a talk](http://new.ted.com/talks/billy_collins_everyday_moments_caught_in_time), and telling him this story.

(You’ll find them referenced in chapter one of *Quiet*.) They were both written in the middle of the 20th century, a time when Americans were trying to break the shackles of their conformist, *Happy Days* culture.

This is an acutely observed look at life inside a New England boarding school, as told from a public school kid from Indiana. I picked up this book the minute I heard about it. Like the *Prep* protagonist, I am not from a preppy background. But I went to Princeton in the 1980s, when it seemed that all the students were from elite private schools and possessed of a breathtaking savoir faire. I thought my mother had taught me decent table manners, but my classmates had an elegant way of holding their utensils that would forever elude me. They also pursued mysterious passions, like trying out for 'crew,' a sport I had never heard of before. I thought they were competing to make extra money washing dishes at the dining hall, and couldn't figure out why they needed the cash.

She reaches millions of people through her books, podcasts and her mission-based organization, Quiet Revolution, which empowers introverts for the benefit of everyone.","whylisten":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Susan Cain is a former corporate lawyer and negotiations consultant -- and a self-described introvert. At least one-third of the people we know are introverts, notes Cain in her book&nbsp;<em>QUIET: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#39;t Stop Talking</em>. Although our culture undervalues them dramatically, introverts have made some of the great contributions to society -- from Chopin&#39;s nocturnes to the invention of the personal computer to Ghandi&#39;s transformative leadership. Cain argues that we design our schools, workplaces and religious institutions for extroverts, and that this bias creates a waste of talent, energy and happiness. Based on intensive research in psychology and neurobiology and on prolific interviews, she also explains why introverts are capable of great love and great achievement, not in spite of their temperament -- but because of them.</span></p>  <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2015 Susan Cain announced the launch of her mission-based organization <a href=\"http://www.quietrev.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quiet Revolution</a> that aims to change the lives of introverts by empowering them with the information, tools and resources they need to survive and thrive.</span></p>  <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the workplace, companies are not fully harnessing the talents of their introverted employees and leadership teams are often imbalanced with many more extroverts than introverts. <a href=\"http://qli.quietrev.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Quiet Leadership Institute</a> has worked with companies from LinkedIn to GE to Procter and Gamble to help them achieve their potential by providing learning experiences that unlock the power of introverts.</span></p>  <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the heart and center of the Quiet Revolution is empowering the next generation of children to know their own strengths and be freed from the sense of inadequacy that has shadowed the children of previous generations. Susan&#39;s second book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0803740603/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687762&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0307352153&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1JFE84DDJBKJ6MM2E0W1\" target=\"_blank\">Quiet Power</a>, is written for teens and young adults but also serves as a tool for teachers and parents. In addition, Susan has created a portal and a online learning experience for the parents of quiet children and has also established the Quiet Schools Network. Susan&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.quietrev.com/susan-cain-quiet-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a>, Quiet: The Power of Introverts debuted in February 2016 as a 10-part series designed to give parents and teachers the tools they need to empower quiet kids.</span></p>  <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Susan and the Quiet Revolution have received numerous accolades and press including <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/03/susan-cain-quiet-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fortune</em> magazine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/fashion/susan-cain-instigating-a-quiet-revolution-of-introverts.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/02/18/465999756/how-parents-and-teachers-can-nurture-the-quiet-power-of-introverts\" target=\"_blank\">NPR</a>and many more.</span></p>"}],"speaker_name":"Susan Cain","tags":["business","culture","psychology","introvert"],"title":"The power of introverts","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":19405545}]}
