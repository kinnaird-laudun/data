<title>Kandice Sumner: How America&#39;s public schools keep kids in poverty | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why should a good education be exclusive to rich kids? Schools in low-income neighborhoods across the US, specifically in communities of color, lack resources that are standard at wealthier schools -- things like musical instruments, new books, healthy school lunches and soccer fields -- and this has a real impact on the potential of students. Kandice Sumner sees the disparity every day in her classroom in Boston. In this inspiring talk, she asks us to face facts -- and change them." />

<meta content="How America's public schools keep kids in poverty" itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Why should a good education be exclusive to rich kids? Schools in low-income neighborhoods across the US, specifically in communities of color, lack resources that are standard at wealthier schools — things like musical instruments, new books, healthy school lunches and soccer fields — and this has a real impact on the potential of students. Kandice Sumner sees the disparity every day in her classroom in Boston. In this inspiring talk, she asks us to face facts — and change them.' itemprop='description'>

											I am the daughter of two hardworking,

											my father, a minister;
my mother, an educator.
											Wealth was never the primary
ambition in our house.
											Because of this lack of wealth,
											we lived in a neighborhood
that lacked wealth,
											and henceforth a school system
that lacked wealth.
											Luckily, however, we struck
the educational jackpot
											in a voluntary desegregation program
											that buses inner-city kids —
black and brown —

											At five years old, I had to take
an hour-long bus ride
											to a faraway place
											to get a better education.
											At five years old, I thought
everyone had a life just like mine.
											I thought everyone went to school
											and were the only ones
using the brown crayons
											to color in their family portraits,
											while everyone else was using
the peach-colored ones.
											At five years old, I thought
everyone was just like me.
											But as I got older, I started
noticing things, like:
											How come my neighborhood friend
don&#39;t have to wake up
											at five o&#39;clock in the morning,
											and go to a school that&#39;s an hour away?
											How come I&#39;m learning to play the violin
											while my neighborhood friends
don&#39;t even have a music class?
											Why were my neighborhood friends
learning and reading material

											All these amazing things
