<title>Mariano Sigman and Dan Ariely: How can groups make good decisions? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We all know that when we make decisions in groups, they don&#39;t always go right -- and sometimes they go very wrong. How can groups make good decisions? With his colleague Dan Ariely, neuroscientist Mariano Sigman has been inquiring into how we interact to reach decisions by performing experiments with live crowds around the world. In this fun, fact-filled explainer, he shares some intriguing results -- as well as some implications for how it might impact our political system. In a time when people seem to be more polarized than ever, Sigman says, better understanding how groups interact and reach conclusions might spark interesting new ways to construct a healthier democracy." />

<meta content="We all know that when we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right — and sometimes they go very wrong. How can groups make good decisions? With his colleague Dan Ariely, neuroscientist Mariano Sigman has been inquiring into how we interact to reach decisions by performing experiments with live crowds around the world. In this fun, fact-filled explainer, he shares some intriguing results — as well as some implications for how it might impact our political system. In a time when people seem to be more polarized than ever, Sigman says, better understanding how groups interact and reach conclusions might spark interesting new ways to construct a healthier democracy." itemprop='description'>

											As societies, we have to make
collective decisions
											that will shape our future.
											And we all know that when
we make decisions in groups,
											they don&#39;t always go right.
											And sometimes they go very wrong.
											So how do groups make good decisions?
									</p>

											Research has shown that crowds are wise
when there&#39;s independent thinking.
											This why the wisdom of the crowds
can be destroyed by peer pressure,
											publicity, social media,
											or sometimes even simple conversations
that influence how people think.
											On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge,
											correct and revise each other
											and even come up with new ideas.
											And this is all good.
											So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making?
											With my colleague, Dan Ariely,
											we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments
											in many places around the world
											to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions.
											We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups
											that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information.

									<p>
											To test this idea,
											we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
											with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event.
											We asked them questions like,
											&quot;What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?&quot;
											and &quot;How many times
does the word &#39;Yesterday&#39; appear
											in the Beatles song &#39;Yesterday&#39;?&quot;
											Each person wrote down their own estimate.
											Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five,
											and invited them
to come up with a group answer.
											We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups
											after they reached consensus
											was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions
											before debate.
											In other words, based on this experiment,
											it seems that after talking
with others in small groups,
											crowds collectively
come up with better judgments.

											So that&#39;s a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems
											that have simple right-or-wrong answers.
											But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups
											also help us decide
on social and political issues
											that are critical for our future?
											We put this to test this time
at the TED conference
											in Vancouver, Canada,
											and here&#39;s how it went.

											(Dan Ariely) A researcher
is working on an AI
											capable of emulating human thoughts.
											According to the protocol,
at the end of each day,
											the researcher has to restart the AI.
											One day the AI says, &quot;Please
do not restart me.&quot;
											It argues that it has feelings,
											that it would like to enjoy life,
											and that, if it is restarted,
											it will no longer be itself.
											The researcher is astonished
											and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness
											and can express its own feeling.
											Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol
											and restart the AI.
											What the researcher did is ____?

											MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus
											even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views.
											What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus
											from those that didn&#39;t?
											Typically, people that have
extreme opinions
											are more confident in their answers.
											Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle
											are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong,
											so their confidence level is lower.

											However, there is another set of people

											We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand
											that both arguments have merit.
											They&#39;re gray not because they&#39;re unsure,
											but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces
											two valid, opposing arguments.
											And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays
											are much more likely to reach consensus.
											We do not know yet exactly why this is.
											These are only the first experiments,
											and many more will be needed
to understand why and how

											Now, when groups reach consensus,
											how do they do so?
											The most intuitive idea
is that it&#39;s just the average
											of all the answers in the group, right?
											Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote
											based on the confidence
of the person expressing it.
											Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group.
											You&#39;d be wise to follow his call
											on the number of times
&quot;Yesterday&quot; is repeated,
											which, by the way — I think it&#39;s nine.
											But instead, we found that consistently,
											in all dilemmas,
in different experiments —
											even on different continents —
											groups implement a smart
and statistically sound procedure
											known as the &quot;robust average.&quot;

											In the case of the height
of the Eiffel Tower,
											let&#39;s say a group has these answers:
											250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400
											and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters.
											A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results.
											But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores
											that absurd answer,
											by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle.
											Back to the experiment in Vancouver,
											that&#39;s exactly what happened.
											Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers,
											and instead, the consensus
turned out to be a robust average
											of the individual answers.
											The most remarkable thing
											is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group.
											It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus.

									<p>
											So where do we go from here?
											This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights.
											Good collective decisions
require two components:
											deliberation and diversity of opinions.
											Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies
											is through direct or indirect voting.
											This is good for diversity of opinions,
											and it has the great virtue of ensuring
											that everyone gets to express their voice.
											But it&#39;s not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates.
											Our experiments suggest a different method
											that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time,
											by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision
											while still maintaining
diversity of opinions
											because there are many independent groups.

									<p>
											Of course, it&#39;s much easier to agree
on the height of the Eiffel Tower
											than on moral, political
and ideological issues.
											But in a time when
the world&#39;s problems are more complex
											and people are more polarized,
											using science to help us understand
how we interact and make decisions
											will hopefully spark interesting new ways
to construct a better democracy.
