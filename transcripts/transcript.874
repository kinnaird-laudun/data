											Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice.
											This is Alex, the best computer voice
											I&#39;ve been able to find,
											which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh.
											For most of my life,
											I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.
											It was like breathing.
											In those days, I was living in a fool&#39;s paradise.
											After surgeries for cancer
											took away my ability to speak, eat or drink,
											I was forced to enter this virtual world
											in which a computer does some of my living for me.

											For several days now,
											we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.
											I used to be able to talk like that.
											Maybe I wasn&#39;t as smart,
											but I was at least as talkative.
											I want to devote my talk today
											to the act of speaking itself,
											and how the act of speaking or not speaking
											is tied so indelibly to one&#39;s identity
											as to force the birth of a new person
											when it is taken away.
											However, I&#39;ve found that listening to a computer voice
											for any great length of time
											can be monotonous.
											So I&#39;ve decided to recruit some of my TED friends
											to read my words aloud for me.
											I will start with my wife, Chaz.

											Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side
											through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw
											and restore my ability to speak.
											Going into the first surgery
											for a recurrence of salivary cancer
											in 2006,
											I expected to be out of the hospital
											in time to return to my movie review show,
											&#39;Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.&#39;
											I had pre-taped enough shows
											to get me through six weeks of surgery
											and recuperation.
											The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg
											and some tissue from my shoulder
											to fashion into a new jaw.
											My tongue, larynx and vocal cords
											were still healthy and unaffected.

											CE: I was optimistic,
											and all was right with the world.
											The first surgery was a great success.
											I saw myself in the mirror
											and I looked pretty good.
											Two weeks later, I was ready to return home.
											I was using my iPod
											to play the Leonard Cohen song
											&#39;I&#39;m Your Man&#39;
											for my doctors and nurses.
											Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding.
											My carotid artery had ruptured.
											Thank God I was still in my hospital room
											and my doctors were right there.
											Chaz told me
											that if that song hadn&#39;t played for so long,
											I might have already been in the car, on the way home,
											and would have died right there and then.
											So thank you, Leonard Cohen,
											for saving my life.

											There was a second surgery —

											A doctor from Brazil said
											he had never seen anyone survive
											a carotid artery rupture.
											And before I left the hospital,
											after a year of being hospitalized,
											I had seven ruptures

											it just sort of became obvious.
											Human speech
											is an ingenious manipulation of our breath
											within the sound chamber of our mouth
											and respiratory system.
											We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath
											in order to form sounds.
											Therefore, the system
											must be essentially airtight
											in order to capture air.
											Because I had lost my jaw,
											I could no longer form a seal,
											and therefore my tongue
											and all of my other vocal equipment
											was rendered powerless.

											Dean Ornish: At first for a long time,
											I wrote messages in notebooks.
											Then I tried typing words on my laptop
											and using its built in voice.
											This was faster,
											and nobody had to try to read my handwriting.
											I tried out various computer voices that were available online,
											and for several months I had a British accent,
											which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											&quot;It was the clearest I could find.
											Then Apple released the Alex voice,
											which was the best I&#39;d heard.
											It knew things like the difference
											between an exclamation point and a question mark.
											When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence
											sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.
											There are all sorts of html codes you can use
											to control the timing and inflection of computer voices,
											and I&#39;ve experimented with them.
											For me, they share a fundamental problem: they&#39;re too slow.
											When I find myself in a conversational situation,
											I need to type fast and to jump right in.
											People don&#39;t have the time or the patience
											to wait for me to fool around with the codes
											for every word or phrase.

											But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?
											How does that affect who you are as a person?
											When people hear Alex speaking my words,
											do they experience a disconnect?
											Does that create a separation or a distance
											from one person to the next?
											How did I feel not being able to speak?
											I felt, and I still feel,
											a lot of distance from the human mainstream.
											I&#39;ve become uncomfortable when I&#39;m separated from my laptop.
											Even then, I&#39;m aware that most people have little patience

											So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice
											using my TV show voice
											from a period of 30 years.
											At first I was against it.
											I thought it would be creepy
											to hear my own voice coming from a computer.
											There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.
											But I decided then to just give it a try.
											So we contacted a company in Scotland
											that created personalized computer voices.
											They&#39;d never made one from previously-recorded materials.
											All of their voices had been made by a speaker
											recording original words in a control booth.
											But they were willing to give it a try.

											So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice,
											including several audio commentary tracks
											that I&#39;d made for movies on DVDs.
											And it sounded like me, it really did.
											There was a reason for that; it was me.
											But it wasn&#39;t that simple.
											The tapes from my TV show weren&#39;t very useful
											because there were too many other kinds of audio involved —
											movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me —
											(Laughter)
											and my words often had a particular emphasis
											that didn&#39;t fit into a sentence well enough.

											It still needs improvement,

											and not like HAL 9000.
											When I heard it the first time,
											it sent chills down my spine.
											When I type anything,
											this voice will speak whatever I type.
											When I read something, it will read in my voice.

											There are several very good voices available for computers,

											Some of the famous early computers

											When I heard the amazing talk
											by Salman Khan on Wednesday,

											that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world,

											It was about 1960.
											As a local newspaper reporter still in high school,

											to interview the creators
											of something called PLATO.
											The initials stood for Programmed Logic
											for Automated Teaching Operations.
											This was a computer-assisted instruction system,

											It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another
											on more and more sophisticated computers,
											until only five years ago.
											I have learned from Wikipedia
											that, starting with that humble beginning,
											PLATO established forums, message boards,
											online testing,
											email, chat rooms,
											picture languages, instant messaging,
											remote screen sharing

											&quot;The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival

											I joined CompuServe
											when it had fewer numbers

The first person to win a Pulitzer for film criticism, as film critic for the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>, he was best known for his decades-long reign as the co-host of <em>Sneak Previews,</em> a TV show with fellow Chicago critic Gene Siskel. For 23 years and three title changes (finally settling on <em>Siskel and Ebert and the Movies</em>) the two critics offered smart, short-form film criticism that guided America&#39;s moviegoing. After Gene Siskel died in 1999, Ebert kept on with critic Richard Roeper. (And he was also the co-screenwriter of the Russ Meyer cult classic&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/beyondthevalley\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</a>,</em>&nbsp;a fact that astounded more than a few young film students.)</p><p>In 2006, Ebert began treatment for thyroid cancer. He told the story of his many surgeries and setbacks in an <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/features/roger-ebert-0310\" target=\"_blank\">immensely-worth-reading <em>Esquire</em> story</a> in 2010. Enduring procedure after procedure, he eventually lost the lower part of his jaw -- and with it his ability to eat and speak.

critic Roger Ebert went on to write about creativity, race, politics and culture -- and film, just as brilliantly as ever.","whylisten":"<p>By any measure, Roger Ebert was a legend. The first person to win a Pulitzer for film criticism, as film critic for the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>, he was best known for his decades-long reign as the co-host of <em>Sneak Previews,</em> a TV show with fellow Chicago critic Gene Siskel. For 23 years and three title changes (finally settling on <em>Siskel and Ebert and the Movies</em>) the two critics offered smart, short-form film criticism that guided America&#39;s moviegoing. After Gene Siskel died in 1999, Ebert kept on with critic Richard Roeper. (And he was also the co-screenwriter of the Russ Meyer cult classic&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/beyondthevalley\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</a>,</em>&nbsp;a fact that astounded more than a few young film students.)</p><p>In 2006, Ebert began treatment for thyroid cancer. He told the story of his many surgeries and setbacks in an <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/features/roger-ebert-0310\" target=\"_blank\">immensely-worth-reading <em>Esquire</em> story</a> in 2010. Enduring procedure after procedure, he eventually lost the lower part of his jaw -- and with it his ability to eat and speak. Turning to his blog and to Twitter, he found a new voice for his film work and his sparkling thoughts on ... just about everything. He tried his hand as an Amazon affiliate, became a finalist in the New Yorker caption contest, and started a controversy or two. In 2013 Ebert passed away from cancer at the age of 70.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Roger Ebert","tags":["community","culture","speech"],"title":"Remaking my voice","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1140238}]}
