<title>Kevin Briggs: The bridge between suicide and life | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For many years Sergeant Kevin Briggs had a dark, unusual, at times strangely rewarding job: He patrolled the southern end of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, a popular site for suicide attempts. In a sobering, deeply personal talk Briggs shares stories from those he’s spoken — and listened — to standing on the edge of life. He gives a powerful piece of advice to those with loved ones who might be contemplating suicide." />

In a sobering, deeply personal talk Briggs shares stories from those he’s spoken — and listened — to standing on the edge of life. He gives a powerful piece of advice to those with loved ones who might be contemplating suicide.' itemprop='description'>

											I recently retired
											from the California Highway Patrol
											after 23 years of service.
											The majority of those 23 years
											was spent patrolling the southern end
											of Marin County,
											which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
											The bridge is an iconic structure,
											known worldwide
											for its beautiful views of San Francisco,
											the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,
											being one of the most utilized sites in the world.
											The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.
											Joseph Strauss, chief engineer
in charge of building the bridge,
											was quoted as saying,
											&quot;The bridge is practically suicide-proof.
											Suicide from the bridge
											is neither practical nor probable.&quot;
											But since its opening,
											over 1,600 people have leapt to their death
											from that bridge.
											Some believe that traveling
											between the two towers
											will lead you to another dimension —
											this bridge has been romanticized as such —
											that the fall from that
											frees you from all your worries and grief,
											and the waters below
											will cleanse your soul.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But let me tell you what actually occurs
											when the bridge is used
											as a means of suicide.
											After a free fall of four to five seconds,
											the body strikes the water
											at about 75 miles an hour.
											That impact shatters bones,
											some of which then puncture vital organs.
											Most die on impact.
											Those that don&#39;t
											generally flail in the water helplessly,
											and then drown.
											I don&#39;t think that those who contemplate
											this method of suicide
											realize how grisly a death that they will face.
											This is the cord.
											Except for around the two towers,
											there is 32 inches of steel
											paralleling the bridge.
											This is where most folks stand
											before taking their lives.
											I can tell you from experience
											that once the person is on that cord,
											and at their darkest time,
											it is very difficult to bring them back.
											I took this photo last year
											as this young woman spoke to an officer
											contemplating her life.
											I want to tell you very happily
											that we were successful that day
											in getting her back over the rail.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											When I first began working on the bridge,
											we had no formal training.
											You struggled to funnel your
way through these calls.
											This was not only a disservice
											to those contemplating suicide,
											but to the officers as well.
											We&#39;ve come a long, long way since then.

											This is Jason Garber.
											I met Jason on July 22 of last year
											when I get received a call
											of a possible suicidal subject
											sitting on the cord near midspan.
											I responded, and when I arrived,
											I observed Jason
											speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.
											Jason was just 32 years old
											and had flown out here from New Jersey.
											As a matter of fact,
											he had flown out here on two other occasions
											from New Jersey
											to attempt suicide on this bridge.
											After about an hour of speaking with Jason,
											he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora&#39;s box.
											Recalling your Greek mythology,
											Zeus created Pandora,
											and sent her down to Earth with a box,
											and told her, &quot;Never, ever open that box.&quot;
											Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,
											and she did open the box.
											Out flew plagues, sorrows,
											and all sorts of evils against man.
											The only good thing in the box was hope.
											Jason then asked us,
											&quot;What happens when you open the box
											and hope isn&#39;t there?&quot;
											He paused a few moments,
											leaned to his right,
											and was gone.
											This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey
											had just committed suicide.

											Jason&#39;s parents had asked him to do so.

											I pose these questions to you:
											What would you do if your family member,
											friend or loved one was suicidal?
											What would you say?
											Would you know what to say?
											In my experience, it&#39;s not just the talking that you do,
											but the listening.
											Listen to understand.
											Don&#39;t argue, blame,
											or tell the person you know how they feel,
											because you probably don&#39;t.
											By just being there,
											you may just be the turning point that they need.
											If you think someone is suicidal,
											don&#39;t be afraid to confront
them and ask the question.
											One way of asking them the question is like this:
											&quot;Others in similar circumstances
											have thought about ending their life;
											have you had these thoughts?&quot;
											Confronting the person head-on
											may just save their life and
be the turning point for them.
											Some other signs to look for:
											hopelessness, believing that things are terrible
											and never going to get better;
											helplessness, believing that there is nothing
											that you can do about it;
											recent social withdrawal;
											and a loss of interest in life.

											&quot;Hi, Kevin. I imagine you&#39;re at the TED Conference.
											That must be quite the experience to be there.
											I&#39;m thinking I should go walk
the bridge this weekend.
											Just wanted to drop you a note.
											Hope you get the word out to many people
											and they go home talking about it
											to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
											I&#39;m still pretty numb,
											but noticing more moments of really realizing
											Mike isn&#39;t coming home.
											Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco
											to watch the 49ers game with his father
											on January 19.
											He never made it there.
											I called Petaluma police
											and reported him missing that evening.
											The next morning,
											two officers came to my home
											and reported that Mike&#39;s car was down at the bridge.
											A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge
											at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.
											Thanks so much
											for standing up for those
											who may be only temporarily too weak
											to stand for themselves.
											Who hasn&#39;t been low before
											without suffering from a true mental illness?
											It shouldn&#39;t be so easy to end it.
											My prayers are with you for your fight.
											The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,
											is supposed to be a passage across
											our beautiful bay,
											not a graveyard.
											Good luck this week. Vicky.&quot;

											I&#39;d like to introduce you to a man
											I refer to as hope and courage.
											On March 11 of 2005,
											I responded to a radio call of a possible
											suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk
											near the north tower.
											I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk
											and observed this man, Kevin Berthia,
											standing on the sidewalk.
											When he saw me, he immediately traversed
											that pedestrian rail,
											and stood on that small pipe
											which goes around the tower.
											For the next hour and a half,
											I listened as Kevin spoke about
											his depression and hopelessness.
											Kevin decided on his own that day
											to come back over that rail
											and give life another chance.
											When Kevin came back over,
											I congratulated him.
											&quot;This is a new beginning, a new life.&quot;
											But I asked him, &quot;What was it
											that made you come back
											and give hope and life another chance?&quot;
											And you know what he told me?
											He said, &quot;You listened.
											You let me speak, and you just listened.&quot;

											&quot;Dear Mr. Briggs,
											Nothing will erase the events of March 11,
											but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.
											I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.
											He has been diagnosed with a mental illness
											for which he has been properly medicated.
											I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,
											completely unaware of any hereditary traits,
											but, thank God, now we know.
											Kevin is straight, as he says.
											We truly thank God for you.
											Sincerely indebted to you,
											Narvella Berthia.&quot;
											And on the bottom she writes,
											&quot;P.S. When I visited San Francisco
General Hospital that evening,
											you were listed as the patient.
											Boy, did I have to straighten that one out.&quot;

											Suicide is not just something
I&#39;ve encountered on the job.
											It&#39;s personal.
											My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.
											That act, although ending his own pain,
											robbed me from ever getting to know him.
											This is what suicide does.
											For most suicidal folks,
											or those contemplating suicide,
											they wouldn&#39;t think of hurting another person.
											They just want their own pain to end.
											Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:
											sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.
											In my career, I&#39;ve responded to
											and been involved in hundreds
											of mental illness and suicide calls
											around the bridge.
											Of those incidents I&#39;ve been directly involved with,
											I&#39;ve only lost two,
											but that&#39;s two too many.
											One was Jason.
											The other was a man I spoke to
											for about an hour.
											During that time, he shook my hand
											on three occasions.
											On that final handshake,
											he looked at me, and he said,
											&quot;Kevin, I&#39;m sorry, but I have to go.&quot;
											And he leapt.
											Horrible, absolutely horrible.

									<p>
											I do want to tell you, though,
											the vast majority of folks
											that we do get to contact on that bridge
											do not commit suicide.
											Additionally, that very few
											who have jumped off the bridge and lived
											and can talk about it,
											that one to two percent,
											most of those folks have said
											that the second that they let go of that rail,
											they knew that they had made a mistake
											and they wanted to live.
											I tell people, the bridge not only connects
											Marin to San Francisco,
											but people together also.
											That connection, or bridge that we make,
											is something that each and every one of us
											should strive to do.
											Suicide is preventable.
											There is help. There is hope.

Tragically, also among them are hundreds of suicidal men and women.<br /><br />As a member of the CHP for over twenty-three years, with the majority of those years patrolling the Golden Gate Bridge, Sgt. Briggs discovered early that his job required him to take on an unusual role for a police officer: suicide prevention counselor. As a cancer survivor and survivor of multiple heart operations, Briggs&rsquo; familiarity with personal struggle bonds him with suicidal men and women. With simple empathy, an instinct for improvisation and a refusal to walk away, Briggs has negotiated several hundred people from suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge. As he told the <em><a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/LETHAL-BEAUTY-The-talkers-For-California-2597635.php\" target=\"_blank\">SF Chronicle</a>, </em>&quot;I&#39;ve talked to people from ten minutes to seven hours.
