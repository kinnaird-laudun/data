											I study the future
											of crime and terrorism,
											and frankly, I&#39;m afraid.
											I&#39;m afraid by what I see.
											I sincerely want to believe
											that technology can bring us
											the techno-utopia that we&#39;ve been promised,
											but, you see,
											I&#39;ve spent a career in law enforcement,
											and that&#39;s informed my perspective on things.
											I&#39;ve been a street police officer,
											an undercover investigator,
											a counter-terrorism strategist,
											and I&#39;ve worked in more than 70 countries
											around the world.
											I&#39;ve had to see more than my fair share
											of violence and the darker underbelly of society,
											and that&#39;s informed my opinions.
											My work with criminals and terrorists
											has actually been highly educational.
											They have taught me a lot, and I&#39;d like to be able
											to share some of these observations with you.

											Today I&#39;m going to show you the flip side
											of all those technologies that we marvel at,
											the ones that we love.
											In the hands of the TED community,
											these are awesome tools which will bring about
											great change for our world,
											but in the hands of suicide bombers,
											the future can look quite different.

											I started observing

											In those days, this was the height of technology.

											Twenty years later, criminals are still using
											mobile phones, but they&#39;re also building
											their own mobile phone networks,
											like this one, which has been deployed
											in all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos.
											They have a national encrypted
											radio communications system.
											Think about that.
											Think about the innovation that went into that.
											Think about the infrastructure to build it.
											And then think about this:
											Why can&#39;t I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco? (Laughter)
											How is this possible? (Laughter) It makes no sense. (Applause)

											Consider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai.
											The men that carried that attack out were armed
											with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades.
											They threw these hand grenades
											at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes
											and waited to catch trains on their way home from work.
											But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations.
											Guns and bombs are nothing new.
											What was different this time
											is the way that the terrorists used
											modern information communications technologies
											to locate additional victims and slaughter them.
											They were armed with mobile phones.
											They had BlackBerries.
											They had access to satellite imagery.
											They had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles.
											But perhaps their greatest innovation was this.
											We&#39;ve all seen pictures like this
											on television and in the news. This is an operations center.
											And the terrorists built their very own op center
											across the border in Pakistan,
											where they monitored the BBC,
											al Jazeera, CNN and Indian local stations.
											They also monitored the Internet and social media
											to monitor the progress of their attacks
											and how many people they had killed.
											They did all of this in real time.

											At one point during the 60-hour siege,

											They came upon a suite on the top floor
											of the hotel, and they kicked down the door
											and they found a man hiding by his bed.
											And they said to him, &quot;Who are you,

											And the man replied,
											&quot;I&#39;m just an innocent schoolteacher.&quot;
											Of course, the terrorists knew
											that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj.
											They picked up his identification,
											and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room,
											where the terrorist war room Googled him,
											and found a picture and called their operatives
											on the ground and said,
											&quot;Your hostage, is he heavyset?
											Is he bald in front? Does he wear glasses?&quot;
											&quot;Yes, yes, yes,&quot; came the answers.

											He was the second-wealthiest businessman in India,

											You can just take the DNA code from marijuana
											or poppies or coca leaves
											and cut and past that gene
											and put it into yeast,
											and you can take those yeast
											and make them make the cocaine for you,
