									<p>
											When you have a creative challenge,
											the natural starting point is to bring
a group of people together to brainstorm.
											Workplaces have relied
on brainstorming for years.
											There&#39;s just one small problem:
											it doesn&#39;t work.
											We actually have decades of evidence
that brainstorming backfires.
											Groups produce fewer ideas and worse ideas
											than the same people working alone.

									<p>
											So what is it about group brainstorming
that stifles creativity?
											First, people silence themselves
because they&#39;re afraid of looking stupid.
											Second, some people silence others
by dominating the conversation.
											And third, everyone just supports
the boss&#39;s favorite idea.
											But The Daily Show
has overcome these problems.
											They&#39;ve cracked the code
of group creativity,
											and I&#39;m going in to find out how.

											Walking in, it&#39;s clear that this show
is a massive machine.
											On any given day, over a hundred
staff and crew members are working on it.
											But I want to focus
on one part of that machine:
											the writers&#39; room.
											It&#39;s where a creative team
of writers, producers,
											and on-camera talent come together.
											Being in a writers&#39; room is sort of
an organizational psychologist&#39;s dream,
											at least it&#39;s one of mine,
											and The Daily Show is giving me
backstage access
											to see how they start the day
with a blank page
											and end up with 22 minutes
of great comedy.

											For years, American symphonies
were dominated by men.
											In the 1970s, a typical ensemble
had nine men for every woman.
											Supposedly women weren&#39;t talented enough,
											but by the 1990s, the gap closed
to less than two to one.
											A huge reason that happened?
											The industry introduced blind auditions,
											where candidates played
from behind a curtain.
											Once the evaluators couldn&#39;t see
whether a performer was a man or a woman,
											their biases were neutralized.
											They focused solely
on the quality of the music,
											and as they should&#39;ve known all along,
											the women were
just as excellent as the men.

											We&#39;ve rarely tracked groups
that have created safety and structure
											over years of working together.
											So no matter how good you get
at finding the right people,
											if you want a group
to have creative bursts,
											what matters most is the time you spend
getting to know each other.
											It&#39;s a twist on the idea that 10,000 hours
of practice helps you become an expert.
											Normally, we think that means
practicing a skill solo,
											but if group creativity is your goal,
											maybe you should be practicing together.
											I think we should take groups
more seriously,
											as an essential unit of creativity.
											Instead of looking
for creative individuals,
											what if we hired intact creative groups?
											And instead of promoting
individual superstars,
											what if we promoted entire teams?
											Because the best creative groups
aren&#39;t just the sum of their parts,
											they&#39;re the sum
of their shared experience.
