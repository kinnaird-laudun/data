											I was trying to think,
what do I talk about? Good question.
											Why do I do so much
stuff that involves mystery?
											And I started trying to figure it out.
											And I started thinking
about why do I do any of what I do,
											and I started thinking
about my grandfather.
											I loved my grandfather.
											Harry Kelvin was his name,
my mother&#39;s father.
											He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.
											And one of the reasons he was amazing:
											After World War II,
he began an electronics company.
											He started selling surplus parts,
kits, to schools and stuff.
											So he had this incredible curiosity.
											As a kid, I saw him come over to me
											with radios and telephones
and all sorts of things.
											And he&#39;d open them up, he&#39;d unscrew them
and reveal the inner workings —
											which many of us,
I&#39;m sure, take for granted.
											But it&#39;s an amazing gift to give a kid.
											To open up this thing
and show how it works
											and why it works and what it is.
											He was the ultimate
deconstructor, in many ways.
											And my grandfather was a kind of guy
who would not only take things apart,
											but he got me interested
in all sorts of different odd crafts,
											like, you know, printing,
like the letter press.
											I&#39;m obsessed with printing.
											I&#39;m obsessed with silk-screening
and bookbinding and box making.
											When I was a kid, I was always,
like, taking apart boxes and stuff.

I took apart the Kleenex box.

years ago at a book fair;
											he does pop-up books.
											And I&#39;m obsessed
with engineering of paper.
											The scoring of it, the printing of it,
											where the thing gets glued,
the registration marks for the ink.
											I just love boxes.
											My grandfather was the guy
											who kind of got me
into all sorts of these things.
											He would also supply me with tools.
											He was this amazing encourager —
this patron, sort of, to make stuff.
											And he got me a Super 8 camera
when I was 10 years old.
											And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,
											to be a 10-year-old kid
that had access to a camera.
											And you know, he was so generous;
I couldn&#39;t believe it.
											He wasn&#39;t doing it
entirely without some manipulation.
											I mean, I would call him, and I&#39;d be like,
											&quot;Listen, Grandpa,
I really need this camera.
											You don&#39;t understand.
This is, like, I want to make movies.
											I&#39;ll get invited to TED one day —&quot;

											So I found myself getting this stuff,
thanks to her assist,
											and suddenly, you know,
											I had a synthesizer
when I was 14 years old —
											this kind of stuff.
											And it let me make things,
which, to me, was sort of the dream.
											He sort of humored my obsession
to other things too, like magic.
											The thing is, we&#39;d go
to this magic store in New York City
											called Lou Tannen&#39;s Magic.
											It was this great magic store.
											It was a crappy
little building in Midtown,
											but you&#39;d be in the elevator,
the elevator would open —
											there&#39;d be this little, small magic store.
											You&#39;d be in the magic store.
And it was a magical place.
											So I got all these magic tricks.
Here. I&#39;ll show you.
											This is the kind of thing.
So it would be like, you know.

											Now, I was looking at this,

why have I not opened this?

drawn to infinite possibility,

											And so I started thinking about &quot;Lost&quot;
and the stuff that we do,
											and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes
are everywhere in what I do!
											In the creation of &quot;Lost,&quot;
Damon Lindelof and I,
											who created the show with me,
											we were basically tasked
with creating this series
											that we had very little time to do.
											We had 11 and a half weeks
											to write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it,
cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.
											So it was not a lot of time.
											And that sense of possibility —
what could this thing be?
											There was no time to develop it.
											I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all familiar with people
											who tell you what you can&#39;t do
and what you should change.
											There was no time for that,
which is kind of amazing.
											And so we did this show,
											and for those of you
who haven&#39;t seen it, or don&#39;t know it,
											I can show you one
little clip from the pilot,
											just to show you some stuff that we did.

											It&#39;s huge! Anyway —

that I started feeling compelled.
											Then there&#39;s the thing of mystery
in terms of imagination —
											the withholding of information.
											You know, doing that intentionally
is much more engaging.
											Whether it&#39;s like the shark in &quot;Jaws&quot; —
											if Spielberg&#39;s mechanical shark,
Bruce, had worked,
											it would not be remotely as scary;
you would have seen it too much.
											In &quot;Alien&quot;, they never
really showed the alien: terrifying!
											Even in a movie like
a romantic comedy, &quot;The Graduate,&quot;
											they&#39;re having that date,
and they&#39;re in the car,
											and it&#39;s loud, and so they put the top up.
											You don&#39;t hear anything they&#39;re saying!

											So to me, there&#39;s that.
And then, finally, there&#39;s this idea —
											stretching the paradigm a little bit —
											but the idea of the mystery box.
											Meaning, what you think you&#39;re getting,
then what you&#39;re really getting.
											And it&#39;s true in so many
movies and stories.
											Look at &quot;E.T.,&quot; for example —
											&quot;E.T.&quot; is this unbelievable
movie about what?
											It&#39;s about an alien
who meets a kid, right?
											Well, it&#39;s not. &quot;E.T.&quot; is about divorce.
											&quot;E.T.&quot; is about a heartbroken,
divorce-crippled family,
											and ultimately,
this kid who can&#39;t find his way.
											&quot;Die Hard,&quot; right? Crazy, great, fun,
action-adventure movie in a building.
											It&#39;s about a guy
who&#39;s on the verge of divorce.
											He&#39;s showing up to L.A.,
tail between his legs.
											There are great scenes —
											maybe not the most amazing
dramatic scenes in the history of time,
											but pretty great scenes.
											There&#39;s a half an hour
of investment in character
											before you get to the stuff
that you&#39;re expecting.

											Come on! So you think of &quot;Jaws&quot; —
											so that&#39;s the kind of stuff that,
											like, you know —
the investment of character,
											which is the stuff that really
is inside the box, you know?
											It&#39;s why when people do sequels,
or rip off movies, you know, of a genre,
											they&#39;re ripping off the wrong thing.
											You&#39;re not supposed
to rip off the shark or the monster.
											You know, if you rip something off —
rip off the character.
											Rip off the stuff that matters.
											I mean, look inside yourself
and figure out what is inside you.
											Because ultimately,
the mystery box is all of us.

											So there&#39;s that. Then the distribution.
											What&#39;s a bigger mystery box
than a movie theater? You know?
											You go to the theater,
you&#39;re just so excited to see anything.
											The moment the lights go down
is often the best part.
											And you&#39;re full of that amazing —
that feeling of excited anticipation.
											And often, the movie&#39;s there
and it&#39;s going,
											and then something happens
and you go, &quot;Oh —&quot;, and then, &quot;Mmm ...&quot;
											When it&#39;s a great movie,
you&#39;re along for the ride

											So to me, whether it&#39;s a TV,
an iPod, computer, cell phone —
											It&#39;s funny, I&#39;m an —
as I said, Apple fanatic —
											and one day, about a year or so ago,
											I was signing on online in the morning
to watch Steve Jobs&#39; keynote,
											because I always do.
											And he came on,
he was presenting the video iPod,
											and what was on
the enormous iPod behind him?
											&quot;Lost&quot;! I had no idea!
											And I realized, holy shit,
it&#39;d come full circle.
											The inspiration I get from the technology
											is now using the stuff that I do
to sell technology. It&#39;s nuts!

											I was going to show you a couple
of other things I&#39;m going to skip.
											I&#39;ll show you one other thing
that has nothing to do with anything.
											This is something online;
six years ago, they did this.
											This is an online thing done by guys
who had some visual effects experience.
											But the point was,
that they were doing things
											that were using these mystery boxes
that they had — everyone has now.
											What I&#39;ve realized is what my grandfather
did for me when I was a kid,
											everyone has access to now.
											You don&#39;t need to have my grandfather,
though you wish you had.
											But I have to tell you —
											this is a guy doing stuff
on a Quadra 950 computer —
											the resolution&#39;s a little bit low —
											using Infinity software
they stopped making 15 years ago.
											He&#39;s doing stuff that looks as amazing

released from Hollywood.

									<p>
											The most incredible
sort of mystery, I think,
											is now the question of what comes next.
											Because it is now democratized.
											So now, the creation of media —
it&#39;s everywhere.
											The stuff that I was lucky
and begging for to get when I was a kid
											is now ubiquitous.
											And so, there&#39;s an amazing sense
of opportunity out there.
											And when I think of the filmmakers
who exist out there now
											who would have been silenced, you know —
											who have been silenced in the past —
											it&#39;s a very exciting thing.

											I used to say in classes
and lectures and stuff,
											to someone who wants to write,
&quot;Go! Write! Do your thing.&quot;
											It&#39;s free, you don&#39;t need permission.
											But now I can say, &quot;Go make your movie!&quot;
There&#39;s nothing stopping you
											from going out there
and getting the technology.
											You can lease, rent,
buy stuff off the shelf
											that is either as good, or just as good,
											as the stuff that&#39;s being used
by the, you know, &quot;legit people.&quot;
											No community is best served
when only the elite have control.

											JJA: OK, now.
											When we shot that scene,
											the actor who had the gun,
an English actor, Eddie Marsan —
											sweetheart, great guy —
											he kept taking the gun
and putting it into Tom&#39;s nose,
											and it was hurting Tom&#39;s nose.

									<p>
											There are three things
you don&#39;t want to do.
											Number two is: Don&#39;t hurt Tom&#39;s nose.
											So Eddie has this gun —
and he&#39;s this sweet English guy.
											He&#39;s like, &quot;Sorry,
I don&#39;t want to hurt you.&quot;
											I&#39;m like, &quot;We have to
make this look good.&quot;
											And I realized that we had to do something
because it wasn&#39;t working.
											And I thought back
to what I would have done
											using the Super 8 camera
that my grandfather got me
											sitting in that room,
											and I realized that hand
didn&#39;t have to be Eddie Marsan&#39;s.
											It could be Tom&#39;s.
											And Tom would know
just how hard to push the gun.
											He wouldn&#39;t hurt himself.

to look a little bit more like Eddie&#39;s.
											We put it in Eddie&#39;s sleeve,
											and so the hand that you see —
											that&#39;s not Eddie&#39;s hand, that&#39;s Tom&#39;s.
