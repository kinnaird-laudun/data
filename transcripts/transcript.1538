<title>Michael Sandel: Why we shouldn&#39;t trust markets with our civic life | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In the past three decades, says Michael Sandel, the US has drifted from a market economy to a market society; it&#39;s fair to say that an American&#39;s experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have. (Three key examples: access to education, access to justice, political influence.) In a talk and audience discussion, Sandel asks us to think honestly on this question: In our current democracy, is too much for sale?" />

<meta content="In the past three decades, says Michael Sandel, the US has drifted from a market economy to a market society; it's fair to say that an American's experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have. (Three key examples: access to education, access to justice, political influence.) In a talk and audience discussion, Sandel asks us to think honestly on this question: In our current democracy, is too much for sale?" itemprop='description'>

											Today, there are very few things
											that money can&#39;t buy.
											If you&#39;re sentenced to a jail term
											in Santa Barbara, California,
											you should know
											that if you don&#39;t like the standard accommodations,
											you can buy a prison cell upgrade.
											It&#39;s true. For how much, do you think?
											What would you guess?
											Five hundred dollars?
											It&#39;s not the Ritz-Carlton. It&#39;s a jail!
											Eighty-two dollars a night.
											Eighty-two dollars a night.
											If you go to an amusement park
											and don&#39;t want to stand in the long lines
											for the popular rides,
											there is now a solution.
											In many theme parks, you can pay extra
											to jump to the head of the line.
											They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.

											And this isn&#39;t only happening in amusement parks.
											In Washington, D.C., long lines,
											queues sometimes form
											for important Congressional hearings.
											Now some people don&#39;t like to wait in long queues,
											maybe overnight, even in the rain.
											So now, for lobbyists and others
											who are very keen to attend these hearings
											but don&#39;t like to wait, there are companies,
											line-standing companies,
											and you can go to them.
											You can pay them a certain amount of money,
											they hire homeless people and others who need a job
											to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes,
											and the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins,
											can take his or her place at the head of the line
											and a seat in the front of the room.
											Paid line standing.

											It&#39;s happening, the recourse to market mechanisms
											and market thinking and market solutions,
											in bigger arenas.
											Take the way we fight our wars.
											Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,
											there were more private military contractors on the ground
											than there were U.S. military troops?
											Now this isn&#39;t because we had a public debate
											about whether we wanted to outsource war
											to private companies,
											but this is what has happened.

											Over the past three decades,
											we have lived through a quiet revolution.
											We&#39;ve drifted almost without realizing it
											from having a market economy
											to becoming market societies.
											The difference is this: A market economy is a tool,
											a valuable and effective tool,
											for organizing productive activity,
											but a market society is a place where
											almost everything is up for sale.
											It&#39;s a way of life, in which market thinking
											and market values begin to dominate
											every aspect of life:
											personal relations, family life, health, education,
											politics, law, civic life.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, why worry? Why worry about our becoming
											market societies?
											For two reasons, I think.
											One of them has to do with inequality.
											The more things money can buy,
											the more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.
											If the only thing that money determined
											was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,
											then inequality wouldn&#39;t matter very much.
											But when money comes increasingly to govern
											access to the essentials of the good life —
											decent health care, access to the best education,
											political voice and influence in campaigns —
											when money comes to govern all of those things,
											inequality matters a great deal.
											And so the marketization of everything
											sharpens the sting of inequality
											and its social and civic consequence.
											That&#39;s one reason to worry.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											There&#39;s a second reason
											apart from the worry about inequality,
											and it&#39;s this:
											with some social goods and practices,
											when market thinking and market values enter,
											they may change the meaning of those practices
											and crowd out attitudes and norms
											worth caring about.

											I&#39;d like to take an example
											of a controversial use of a market mechanism,
											a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.
											Many schools struggle with the challenge
											of motivating kids, especially kids
											from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard,
											to do well in school, to apply themselves.
											Some economists have proposed a market solution:
											Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades
											or high test scores
											or for reading books.
											They&#39;ve tried this, actually.
											They&#39;ve done some experiments
											in some major American cities.
											In New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,
											they&#39;ve tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A,
											35 dollars for a B.
											In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers
											eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let&#39;s see what — Some people are in favor,
											some people are opposed to this cash incentive
											to motivate achievement.
											Let&#39;s see what people here think about it.
											Imagine that you are the head of a major school system,
											and someone comes to you with this proposal.
											And let&#39;s say it&#39;s a foundation. They will provide the funds.
											You don&#39;t have to take it out of your budget.
											How many would be in favor
											and how many would be opposed to giving it a try?

											Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings out
											is something that many economists overlook.
											Economists often assume
											that markets are inert,
											that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.
											Market exchange, they assume,
											doesn&#39;t change the meaning or value
											of the goods being exchanged.
											This may be true enough
											if we&#39;re talking about material goods.
											If you sell me a flat screen television
											or give me one as a gift,
											it will be the same good.
											It will work the same either way.
											But the same may not be true
											if we&#39;re talking about nonmaterial goods
											and social practices such as teaching and learning
											or engaging together in civic life.
											In those domains, bringing market mechanisms
											and cash incentives may undermine
											or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes
											worth caring about.
											Once we see
											that markets and commerce,
											when extended beyond the material domain,
											can change the character of the goods themselves,
											can change the meaning of the social practices,
											as in the example of teaching and learning,
											we have to ask where markets belong
											and where they don&#39;t,
											where they may actually undermine
											values and attitudes worth caring about.
											But to have this debate,
											we have to do something we&#39;re not very good at,
											and that is to reason together in public
											about the value and the meaning
											of the social practices we prize,
											from our bodies to family life
											to personal relations to health
											to teaching and learning to civic life.

											Now these are controversial questions,
											and so we tend to shrink from them.
											In fact, during the past three decades,
											when market reasoning and market thinking
											have gathered force and gained prestige,
											our public discourse during this time
											has become hollowed out,
											empty of larger moral meaning.
											For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.
											But once we see that markets
											change the character of goods,
											we have to debate among ourselves
											these bigger questions
											about how to value goods.

											One of the most corrosive effects
											of putting a price on everything
											is on commonality,
											the sense that we are all in it together.
											Against the background of rising inequality,
											marketizing every aspect of life
											leads to a condition where those who are affluent
											and those who are of modest means
											increasingly live separate lives.
											We live and work and shop and play
											in different places.

											This isn&#39;t good for democracy,
											nor is it a satisfying way to live,
											even for those of us who can afford
											to buy our way to the head of the line.
											Here&#39;s why.
											Democracy does not require perfect equality,
											but what it does require
											is that citizens share in a common life.
											What matters is that people
											of different social backgrounds
											and different walks of life
											encounter one another,
											bump up against one another
											in the ordinary course of life,
											because this is what teaches us
											to negotiate and to abide our differences.
											And this is how we come to care for the common good.

											And so, in the end, the question of markets
											is not mainly an economic question.
											It&#39;s really a question of how we want to live together.
											Do we want a society where everything is up for sale,
											or are there certain moral and civic goods
											that markets do not honor
											and money cannot buy?

The <em>London Observer </em>calls him &quot;one of the most popular teachers in the world&quot; and indeed his lectures at Harvard draw thousands of students eager to discuss big questions of modern political life: bioethics, torture, rights versus responsibilities, the value we put on things. Sandel&#39;s class is a primer on thinking through the hard choices we face as citizens. The course has been turned into a public TV series with companion website and book:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/justicewhatsright\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Justice: What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do?</em></a>&nbsp;In his newest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/whatmoneycantbuy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>What Money Can&#39;t Buy</em></a><em>, </em>he challenges the idea that markets are morally neutral.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;To understand the importance of his purpose,&quot; a <em>Guardian</em> reviewer wrote of the book, &quot;you first have to grasp the full extent of the triumph achieved by market thinking in economics, and the extent to which that thinking has spread to other domains. This school sees economics as a discipline that has nothing to do with morality, and is instead the study of incentives, considered in an ethical vacuum. Sandel&#39;s book is, in its calm way, an all-out assault on that idea, and on the influential doctrine that the economic approach to &quot;utility maximisation&quot; explains all human behaviour.&quot;</p><p>Read more about his thinking on markets and morality: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/bd509112-9c55-11e2-9a4b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2PhLrm500\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Lunch with Michael Sandel&quot; on FT.com &gt;&gt;</a> &nbsp; </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Michael Sandel","tags":["Debate","business","social change","markets"],"title":"Why we shouldn't trust markets with our civic life","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1795151}]}
