											Could I protect my father
											from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife?
											That was the question I faced

											when I was a law student.

											I woke up early that morning
											in Dad&#39;s apartment
											on the outskirts of Algiers, Algeria,
											to an unrelenting pounding on the front door.
											It was a season as described by a local paper
											when every Tuesday a scholar fell
											to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins.
											My father&#39;s university teaching of Darwin
											had already provoked a classroom visit
											from the head of the so-called
Islamic Salvation Front,
											who denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism
											before Dad had ejected the man,
											and now whoever was outside
											would neither identify himself nor go away.
											So my father tried to get the police on the phone,
											but perhaps terrified by the rising tide
											of armed extremism that had already claimed
											the lives of so many Algerian officers,
											they didn&#39;t even answer.
											And that was when I went to the kitchen,
											got out a paring knife,
											and took up a position inside the entryway.
											It was a ridiculous thing to do, really,
											but I couldn&#39;t think of anything else,
											and so there I stood.

											When I look back now, I think
that that was the moment
											that set me on the path was to writing a book
											called &quot;Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here:
											Untold Stories from the Fight
Against Muslim Fundamentalism.&quot;
											The title comes from a Pakistani play.
											I think it was actually that moment
											that sent me on the journey
											to interview 300 people of Muslim heritage
											from nearly 30 countries,
											from Afghanistan to Mali,
											to find out how they fought fundamentalism
											peacefully like my father did,
											and how they coped with the attendant risks.

											Luckily, back in June of 1993,
											our unidentified visitor went away,
											but other families were so much less lucky,
											and that was the thought
that motivated my research.
											In any case, someone would return
											a few months later and leave a note
											on Dad&#39;s kitchen table,
											which simply said, &quot;Consider yourself dead.&quot;
											Subsequently, Algeria&#39;s
fundamentalist armed groups
											would murder as many as 200,000 civilians
											in what came to be known
											as the dark decade of the 1990s,
											including every single one
											of the women that you see here.
											In its harsh counterterrorist response,
											the state resorted to torture
											and to forced disappearances,
											and as terrible as all of these events became,
											the international community largely ignored them.
											Finally, my father, an Algerian
peasant&#39;s son turned professor,
											was forced to stop teaching at the university
											and to flee his apartment,
											but what I will never forget
											about Mahfoud Bennoune, my dad,
											was that like so many other Algerian intellectuals,
											he refused to leave the country
											and he continued to publish pointed criticisms,
											both of the fundamentalists
											and sometimes of the government they battled.
											For example, in a November 1994 series
											in the newspaper El Watan
											entitled &quot;How Fundamentalism
											Produced a Terrorism without Precedent,&quot;
											he denounced what he called
											the terrorists&#39; radical break with the true Islam
											as it was lived by our ancestors.
											These were words that could get you killed.

											is one of the most important
											and overlooked human rights struggles
											in the world.
											This remains true today, nearly 20 years later.
											You see, in every country
											where you hear about armed jihadis
											targeting civilians,
											there are also unarmed people
											defying those militants that you don&#39;t hear about,
											and those people need our support to succeed.

											In the West, it&#39;s often assumed
											that Muslims generally condone terrorism.
											Some on the right think this because they view
											Muslim culture as inherently violent,
											and some on the left imagine this
											because they view Muslim violence,
											fundamentalist violence,
											solely as a product of legitimate grievances.
											But both views are dead wrong.
											In fact, many people of Muslim heritage
											around the world are staunch opponents
											both of fundamentalism and of terrorism,
											and often for very good reason.
											You see, they&#39;re much more likely to be victims
											of this violence than its perpetrators.
											Let me just give you one example.
											According to a 2009 survey
											of Arabic language media resources,
											between 2004 and 2008,
											no more than 15 percent of al Qaeda&#39;s victims
											were Westerners.
											That&#39;s a terrible toll, but the vast majority
											were people of Muslim heritage,
											killed by Muslim fundamentalists.

											Now I&#39;ve been talking for the last five minutes
											about fundamentalism, and you have a right to know
											exactly what I mean.
											I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist
											Marieme Helie Lucas,
											and she says that fundamentalisms,
											note the &quot;s,&quot; so within all of the world&#39;s
											great religious traditions,
											&quot;fundamentalisms are political
movements of the extreme right
											which in a context of globalization
											manipulate religion in order to achieve
											their political aims.&quot;
											Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization
											of theology.
											Now I want to avoid projecting the notion
											that there&#39;s sort of a monolith out there
											called Muslim fundamentalism
that is the same everywhere,
											because these movements
also have their diversities.
											Some use and advocate violence.
											Some do not, though they&#39;re often interrelated.
											They take different forms.
											Some may be non-governmental organizations,
											even here in Britain like Cageprisoners.
											Some may become political parties,
											like the Muslim Brotherhood,
											and some may be openly armed groups
											like the Taliban.
											But in any case, these are all radical projects.
											They&#39;re not conservative or traditional approaches.
											They&#39;re most often about changing
people&#39;s relationship with Islam
											rather than preserving it.
											What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right,
											and the fact that its adherents are
											or purport to be Muslim
											makes them no less offensive
											than the extreme right anywhere else.
											So in my view, if we consider ourselves
											liberal or left-wing,
											human rights-loving or feminist,
											we must oppose these movements
											and support their grassroots opponents.
											Now let me be clear
											that I support an effective struggle
											against fundamentalism,
											but also a struggle that must itself
											respect international law,
											so nothing I am saying should be taken
											as a justification for refusals
											to democratize,
											and here I send out a shout-out of support
											to the pro-democracy movement 
in Algeria today, Barakat.
											Nor should anything I say be taken
											as a justification of violations of human rights,
											like the mass death sentences
											handed out in Egypt earlier this week.
											But what I am saying
											is that we must challenge these
Muslim fundamentalist movements
											because they threaten human rights
											across Muslim-majority contexts,
											and they do this in a range of ways,
											most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians
											by the armed groups that carry those out.
											But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg.
											These movements as a whole purvey discrimination
											against religious minorities and sexual minorities.
											They seek to curtail the freedom of religion
											of everyone who either practices in a different way
											or chooses not to practice.
											And most definingly, they lead an all-out war
											on the rights of women.

											Now, faced with these movements
											in recent years, Western discourse
											has most often offered
											two flawed responses.
											The first that one sometimes finds on the right
											suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist
											or something about Islam is
inherently fundamentalist,
											and this is just offensive and wrong,
											but unfortunately on the left
one sometimes encounters
											a discourse that is too politically correct
											to acknowledge the problem of
Muslim fundamentalism at all
											or, even worse, apologizes for it,
											and this is unacceptable as well.
											So what I&#39;m seeking is a new way
											of talking about this all together,
											which is grounded in the lived experiences
											and the hope of the people on the front lines.
											I&#39;m painfully aware that there has been
											an increase in discrimination
against Muslims in recent years
											in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.,
											and that too is a matter of grave concern,
											but I firmly believe
											that telling these counter-stereotypical stories
											of people of Muslim heritage
											who have confronted the fundamentalists
											and been their primary victims
											is also a great way of countering that discrimination.
											So now let me introduce you
											to four people whose stories
											I had the great honor of telling.

											Faizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre
											workshop named for his father
											have for years promoted the performing arts
											in Pakistan.
											With the rise of jihadist violence,
											they began to receive threats
											to call off their events, which they refused to heed.
											And so a bomber struck their 2008
											eighth world performing arts festival in Lahore,
											producing rain of glass
											that fell into the venue
											injuring nine people,
											and later that same night,
											the Peerzadas made a very difficult decision:
											they announced that their festival
											would continue as planned the next day.
											As Faizan said at the time,
											if we bow down to the Islamists,
											we&#39;ll just be sitting in a dark corner.
											But they didn&#39;t know what would happen.
											Would anyone come?
											In fact, thousands of people came out the next day
											to support the performing arts in Lahore,
											and this simultaneously thrilled
											and terrified Faizan,
											and he ran up to a woman
											who had come in with her two small children,
											and he said, &quot;You do know there
was a bomb here yesterday,
											and you do know there&#39;s a threat here today.&quot;
											And she said, &quot;I know that,
											but I came to your festival
											with my mother when I was their age,
											and I still have those images in my mind.
											We have to be here.&quot;
											With stalwart audiences like this,
											the Peerzadas were able to conclude
											their festival on schedule.

											And then the next year,
											they lost all of their sponsors
											due to the security risk.
											So when I met them in 2010,
											they were in the middle of the first subsequent event
											that they were able to have in the same venue,
											and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival
											held in Lahore in a year when that city
											had already experienced 44 terror attacks.
											This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban
											had commenced their systematic targeting
											of girls&#39; schools that would culminate
											in the attack on Malala Yousafzai.
											What did the Peerzadas do in that environment?
											They staged girls&#39; school theater.
											So I had the privilege of watching &quot;Naang Wal,&quot;
											which was a musical in the Punjabi language,
											and the girls of Lahore Grammar School
											played all the parts.
											They sang and danced,
											they played the mice and the water buffalo,
											and I held my breath, wondering,
											would we get to the end
											of this amazing show?
											And when we did, the whole audience
											collectively exhaled,
											and a few people actually wept,
											and then they filled the auditorium
											with the peaceful boom of their applause.
											And I remember thinking in that moment
											that the bombers made headlines here
											two years before
											but this night and these people
											are as important a story.

											Maria Bashir is the first and only

											She&#39;s been in the post since 2008
											and actually opened an office to investigate

											which she says is the most important area

											When I meet her in her office in Herat,

											Why does she continue?
											She says with a smile that that is the question
											that everyone asks—
											as she puts it, &quot;Why you risk not living?&quot;
											And it is simply that for her,
											a better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come
											is worth the risk,
											and she knows that if people like her
											do not take the risk,
											there will be no better future.
											Later on in our interview,
											Prosecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is
											about the possible outcome
											of government negotiations with the Taliban,
											the people who have been trying to kill her.
											&quot;If we give them a place in the government,&quot;
											she asks, &quot;Who will protect women&#39;s rights?&quot;
											And she urges the international community
											not to forget its promise about women
											because now they want peace with Taliban.
											A few weeks after I leave Afghanistan,
											I see a headline on the Internet.
											An Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated.
											I google desperately,
											and thankfully that day I find out
											that Maria was not the victim,
											though sadly, another Afghan prosecutor
											was gunned down on his way to work.
											And when I hear headlines like that now,
											I think that as international troops
											leave Afghanistan this year and beyond,
											we must continue to care
											about what happens to people there,
											to all of the Maria Bashirs.
											Sometimes I still hear her voice in my head
											saying, with no bravado whatsoever,
											&quot;The situation of the women of Afghanistan
											will be better someday.
											We should prepare the ground for this,

											There are no words adequate
											to denounce the al Shabaab terrorists
											who attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi
											on the same day as a children&#39;s cooking competition
											in September of 2013.
											They killed 67, including poets and pregnant women.
											Far away in the American Midwest,
											I had the good fortune of meeting Somali-Americans
											who were working to counter
the efforts of al Shabaab
											to recruit a small number of young people
											from their city of Minneapolis
											to take part in atrocities like Westgate.
											Abdirizak Bihi&#39;s studious
											17-year-old nephew Burhan Hassan
											was recruited here in 2008,
											spirited to Somalia,
											and then killed when he tried to come home.
											Since that time, Mr. Bihi,
											who directs the no-budget Somali
Education and Advocacy Center,
											has been vocally denouncing the recruitment
											and the failures of government
											and Somali-American institutions
											like the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center
											where he believes his nephew was radicalized
											during a youth program.
											But he doesn&#39;t just criticize the mosque.
											He also takes on the government
											for its failure to do more
											to prevent poverty in his community.
											Given his own lack of financial resources,
											Mr. Bihi has had to be creative.
											To counter the efforts of al Shabaab
											to sway more disaffected youth,
											in the wake of the group&#39;s 2010 attack
											on World Cup viewers in Uganda,
											he organized a Ramadan basketball tournament
											in Minneapolis in response.
											Scores of Somali-American kids came out
											to embrace sport
											despite the fatwa against it.
											They played basketball
											as Burhan Hassan never would again.
											For his efforts, Mr. Bihi has been ostracized
											by the leadership of the Abubakar
As-Saddique Islamic Center,
											with which he used to have good relations.
											He told me, &quot;One day we saw the imam on TV
											calling us infidels and saying,
											&#39;These families are trying to destroy the mosque.&#39;&quot;
											This is at complete odds
											with how Abdirizak Bihi understands
											what he is trying to do
											by exposing al Shabaab recruitment,
											which is to save the religion I love
											from a small number of extremists.

											Now I want to tell one last story,
											that of a 22-year-old law student in Algeria
											named Amel Zenoune-Zouani
											who had the same dreams of a legal career
											that I did back in the &#39;90s.
											She refused to give up her studies,
											despite the fact that the fundamentalists
											battling the Algerian state back then
											threatened all who continued their education.
											On January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus
											in Algiers where she was studying
											to go home and spend a Ramadan evening
											with her family,
											and would never finish law school.
											When the bus reached the outskirts
											of her hometown, it was stopped
											at a checkpoint manned by men
											from the Armed Islamic Group.
											Carrying her schoolbag,
											Amel was taken off the bus
											and killed in the street.
											The men who cut her throat
											then told everyone else,
											&quot;If you go to university,
											the day will come when we will kill all of you
											just like this.&quot;

									<p>
											Amel died at exactly 5:17 p.m.,
											which we know because when she fell in the street,
											her watch broke.
											Her mother showed me the watch
											with the second hand still aimed
											optimistically upward
											towards a 5:18 that would never come.
											Shortly before her death,
											Amel had said to her mother of herself
											and her sisters,
											&quot;Nothing will happen to us, Inshallah, God willing,
											but if something happens,
											you must know that we are dead for knowledge.
											You and father must keep your heads held high.&quot;

									<p>
											The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable,
											and so as I did my research
											I found myself searching for Amel&#39;s hope again
											and her name even means &quot;hope&quot; in Arabic.
											I think I found it in two places.
											The first is in the strength of her family
											and all the other families to
continue telling their stories
											and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism.
											In fact, Amel&#39;s sister Lamia overcame her grief,
											went to law school,
											and practices as a lawyer in Algiers today,
											something which is only possible
											because the armed fundamentalists
											were largely defeated in the country.
											And the second place I found Amel&#39;s hope
											was everywhere that women and men
											continue to defy the jihadis.
											We must support all of those in honor of Amel
											who continue this human rights struggle today,
											like the Network of Women
Living Under Muslim Laws.
											It is not enough, as the victims rights advocate
											Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers,
											it is not enough just to battle terrorism.
											We must also challenge fundamentalism,
											because fundamentalism is the ideology
											that makes the bed of this terrorism.

											Why is it that people like her, like all of them
											are not more well known?
											Why is it that everyone knows
who Osama bin Laden was
											and so few know of all of those
											standing up to the bin Ladens in their own contexts.
											We must change that, and so I ask you
											to please help share these stories
											through your networks.
											Look again at Amel Zenoune&#39;s watch,
											forever frozen,
											and now please look at your own watch
											and decide this is the moment that you commit
											to supporting people like Amel.
											We don&#39;t have the right to be silent about them
											because it is easier
											or because Western policy is flawed as well,
											because 5:17 is still coming
											to too many Amel Zenounes
											in places like northern Nigeria,
											where jihadis still kill students.
											The time to speak up in support of all of those
											who peacefully challenge fundamentalism
											and terrorism in their own communities
											is now.

She grew up in Algeria and the United States and now lives in northern California.<br /><br />She has published widely in many leading academic journals, as well as in the Guardian, The New York Times, Comment is Free, the website of Al Jazeera English, The Nation. The topic of her most recent publication &lsquo;Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here&rsquo; is a very personal one for her. Her father Mahfoud Bennoune was an outspoken professor at the University of Algiers, and faced death threats during the 1990s, but continued speaking out against fundamentalism and terrorism. In writing this book, Karima set out to meet people who are today doing what her father did back then, to try to garner for them greater international support than Algerian democrats received during the 1990s.<br /><br />She has served as a member of the Executive Council of the American Society of International Law and on the board of directors of Amnesty International USA. Currently, she sits on the Board of the Network of Women Living Under Muslim Laws. She has also been a consultant on human rights issues for the International Council on Human Rights Policy, the Soros Foundation, the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, and for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Her human rights field missions have included Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Fiji, Lebanon, Pakistan, South Korea, southern Thailand, and Tunisia.<br /><br />She traveled to Algeria in February 2011 to serve as an observer at pro-democracy protests with the support of the Urgent Action Fund for Women&rsquo;s Human Rights, writing a series of articles about these events for the Guardian. In October 2011, she volunteered as an election observer during the Tunisian constituent assembly elections with Gender Concerns International.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Karima Bennoune","tags":["history","religion","storytelling","terrorism","war"],"title":"When people of Muslim heritage challenge fundamentalism","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1453213}]}
