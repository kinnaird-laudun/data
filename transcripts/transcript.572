											Something called the Danish Twin Study
											established that only about 10 percent
											of how long the average person lives,
											within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.
											The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.
											So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the
											optimal lifestyle of longevity
											we can come up with a de facto formula
											for longevity.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula
											of longevity is, they probably couldn&#39;t tell you.
											They&#39;ve probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.
											You have the USDA food pyramid.
											There is what Oprah tells us.
											There is what Doctor Oz tells us.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion
											around what really helps us live longer better.
											Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?
											Should you eat organic meats
											or should you be eating tofu?
											When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?
											How about these hormones or resveratrol?
											And does purpose play into it?
											Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, our approach to finding longevity
											was to team up with National Geographic,
											and the National Institute on Aging,
											to find the four demographically confirmed areas
											that are geographically defined.
											And then bring a team of experts in there
											to methodically go through exactly what these people do,
											to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And at the end of this I&#39;m going to tell you what that distillation is.
											But first I&#39;d like to debunk some common myths
											when it comes to longevity.
											And the first myth is if you try really hard
											you can live to be 100.
											False.
											The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people
											in America live to be 100.
											Your chances are very low.
											Even though it&#39;s the fastest growing demographic in America,
											it&#39;s hard to reach 100.
											The problem is
											that we&#39;re not programmed for longevity.
											We are programmed for something called
											procreative success.
											I love that word.
											It reminds me of my college days.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Biologists term procreative success to mean
											the age where you have children
											and then another generation, the age when your children have children.
											After that the effect of evolution
											completely dissipates.
											If you&#39;re a mammal, if you&#39;re a rat
											or an elephant, or a human, in between, it&#39;s the same story.
											So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have
											had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won
											the genetic lottery.

											The second myth is,
											there are treatments that can help slow,
											reverse, or even stop aging.
											False.
											When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.
											Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,

											Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,

											Our bodies have 35 trillion cells,

											Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.
											And every time they turn themselves over

											which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.
											Their diet is mostly plant-based,

											they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.
