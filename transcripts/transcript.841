											Ten years ago exactly,
											I was in Afghanistan.
											I was covering the war in Afghanistan,
											and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,
											the amount of suffering and destruction
											that emerged out of a war like that.
											Then, two years later,
											I covered another war — the war in Iraq.
											I was placed at the center of that war
											because I was covering the war
											from the northern part of Iraq.
											And the war ended
											with a regime change,
											like the one in Afghanistan.
											And that regime
											that we got rid of
											was actually a dictatorship,
											an authoritarian regime,
											that for decades
											created a great sense of paralysis
											within the nation, within the people themselves.
											However,
											the change that came through foreign intervention
											created even worse circumstances for the people
											and deepened the sense
											of paralysis and inferiority
											in that part of the world.

											For decades,
											we have lived under authoritarian regimes —
											in the Arab world, in the Middle East.
											These regimes
											created something within us during this period.
											I&#39;m 43 years old right now.
											For the last 40 years,
											I have seen almost the same faces
											for kings and presidents ruling us —
											old, aged, authoritarian,
											corrupt situations —
											regimes that we have seen around us.
											And for a moment I was wondering,
											are we going to live in order to see
											real change happening on the ground,
											a change that does not come through foreign intervention,
											through the misery of occupation,
											through nations invading our land
											and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?
											The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,
											but when they saw
											their land occupied by foreign forces
											they felt very sad,
											they felt that their dignity had suffered.
											And this is why they revolted.
											This is why they did not accept.
											And actually other regimes, they told their citizens,
											&quot;Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?
											Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?
											Would you like to see destruction?
											Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?&quot;
											And the people thought for themselves,
											&quot;Maybe we should live with
											this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in,
											instead of having the second scenario.&quot;
											That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.

											For 10 years,
											unfortunately we have found ourselves
											reporting images of destruction,
											images of killing,
											of sectarian conflicts,
											images of violence,
											emerging from a magnificent piece of land,
											a region that one day was the source
											of civilizations and art and culture
											for thousands of years.
											Now I am here to tell you
											that the future
											that we were dreaming for
											has eventually arrived.
											A new generation,
											well-educated,
											connected,
											inspired by universal values
											and a global understanding,
											has created a new reality for us.
											We have found a new way
											to express our feelings
											and to express our dreams:
											these young people
											who have restored self-confidence
											in our nations in that part of the world,
											who have given us
											new meaning for freedom
											and empowered us to go down to the streets.
											Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing.
											Just step out of your house,
											raise your voice
											and say, &quot;We would like to see the end of the regime.&quot;

											This is what happened in Tunisia.
											Over a few days,
											the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars
											in the security agencies,
											billions of dollars
											in maintaining, trying to maintain,
											its prisons,
											collapsed, disappeared,
											because of the voices of the public.
											People who were inspired to go down to the streets
											and to raise their voices,
											they tried to kill.
											The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.
											They found something called Facebook.
											They found something called Twitter.
											They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.
											And they said,
											&quot;These kids are misled.&quot;
											Therefore, they asked their parents
											to go down to the streets
											and collect them, bring them back home.
											This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.
											&quot;Bring these kids home
											because they are misled.&quot;
											But yes,
											these youth
											who have been inspired
											by universal values,
											who are idealistic enough
											to imagine a magnificent future
											and, at the same time, realistic enough
											to balance this kind of imagination
											and the process leading to it —
											not using violence,
											not trying to create chaos —
											these young people,
											they did not go home.
											Parents actually went to the streets
											and they supported them.
											And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.

											We in Al Jazeera
											were banned from Tunisia for years,
											and the government did not allow
											any Al Jazeera reporter to be there.
											But we found that these people in the street,
											all of them are our reporters,
											feeding our newsroom
											with pictures, with videos
											and with news.
											And suddenly that newsroom in Doha
											became a center
											that received all this kind of input from ordinary people —
											people who are connected and people who have ambition
											and who have liberated themselves
											from the feeling of inferiority.
											And then we took that decision:
											We are unrolling the news.
											We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.
											We are going to spread the message.
											Yes, some of these young people
											are connected to the Internet,
											but the connectivity in the Arab world
											is very little, is very small,
											because of many problems that we are suffering from.
											But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people
											and we amplified [it].
											We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world —
											and internationally, globally,
											through our English channel.

											And then people started to feel
											that there&#39;s something new happening.
											And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali
											decided to leave.
											And then Egypt started,
											and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.
											And now Libya as you see it.
											And then you have Yemen.
											And you have many other countries trying to see
											and to rediscover that feeling
											of, &quot;How do we imagine a future
											which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?&quot;
											I want to tell you something,
											that the Internet and connectivity
											has created [a] new mindset.
											But this mindset
											has continued to be faithful
											to the soil and to the land
											that it emerged from.
											And while this was the major difference
											between many initiatives before
											to create change,
											before we thought, and governments told us —
											and even sometimes it was true —
											that change was imposed on us,
											and people rejected that,
											because they thought that it is alien to their culture.
											Always, we believed
											that change will spring from within,
											that change should be a reconciliation
											with culture, cultural diversity,
											with our faith in our tradition
											and in our history,
											but at the same time,
											open to universal values, connected with the world,
											tolerant to the outside.
											And this is the moment
											that is happening right now in the Arab world.
											This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment
											that we see all of these meanings meet together
											and then create the beginning
											of this magnificent era
											that will emerge from the region.

											How did the elite deal with that —
											the so-called political elite?
											In front of Facebook,
											they brought the camels in Tahrir Square.
											In front of Al Jazeera,
											they started creating tribalism.
											And then when they failed,
											they started speaking about conspiracies
											that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington
											in order to divide the Arab world.
											They started telling the West,
											&quot;Be aware of Al-Qaeda.
											Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories.

											Al Jazeera is not

											when something of that magnitude happens,

											We were banned from Egypt,
											and our correspondents,
											some of them were arrested.
											But most of our camera people
											and our journalists,
											they went underground in Egypt — voluntarily —
											to report what happened in Tahrir Square.
											For 18 days,
											our cameras were broadcasting, live,
											the voices of the people in Tahrir Square.
											I remember one night
											when someone phoned me on my cellphone —
											ordinary person who I don&#39;t know — from Tahrir Square.
											He told me, &quot;We appeal to you
											not to switch off the cameras.
											If you switch off the cameras tonight,
											there will be a genocide.
											You are protecting us

											I felt the responsibility

											and to phone our newsroom

											So we have a chance
											to create a new future
											in that part of the world.
											We have a chance
											to go and to think of the future
											as something which is open to the world.
											Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran,

											Let us free ourselves — especially in the West —
											from thinking about that part of the world
											based on oil interest,
											or based on interests
											of the illusion of stability and security.
											The stability and security
											of authoritarian regimes
											cannot create
											but terrorism and violence and destruction.
											Let us accept the choice of the people.
											Let us not pick and choose
											who we would like to rule their future.
											The future should be ruled
											by people themselves,
											even sometimes if they are voices
											that might now scare us.
											But the values of democracy
											and the freedom of choice
											that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time
											is the best opportunity for the world,
											for the West and the East,
											to see stability and to see security
											and to see friendship and to see tolerance
											emerging from the Arab world,
											rather than the images of violence and terrorism.
											Let us support these people.
											Let us stand for them.
											And let us give up
											our narrow selfishness
											in order to embrace change,
											and in order to celebrate with the people of that region
											a great future
											and hope and tolerance.
											The future has arrived,

											WK: And people actually,

years ago, Arabia was controlled by governments, and therefore the media -- mainly TV stations -- were pushing only one line, which was the government's vision about reality and politics.

Al Jazeera&#39;s approach to journalism emphasizes &quot;re-thinking authority, giving a voice to the voiceless,&quot; Khanfar said in <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1559468,00.html#ixzz1FT91mLH9\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with TIME</a>.<br /><br />No news network has attracted as much controversy as Al Jazeera. Khanfar, in turn, became the lightning rod for dispute on the organization&#39;s place in politics, both in its home region and abroad.
