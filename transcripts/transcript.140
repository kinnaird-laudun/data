									<p>
											Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made,
											with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.
											My idea — and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night,
											and we&#39;ve all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep —
											I was excited, with this phone call.
											I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets,
											and I realized I&#39;d gotten to know their stories,
											and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
											to tell a warrior&#39;s story as it unfolded.
											So I went to bed that night pretty excited.
											Not sure of all the details, but excited.
											It wasn&#39;t at four in the morning, but it was closer to midnight.
											Woke straight up. Wide-awake as could be.
											And I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed,
											and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?
											To tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in?
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, I called back Major Heilshorn,
											who&#39;s the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard.
											And he knew me, so I was like, &quot;Greg?&quot;
											He&#39;s like, &quot;Yes, Deborah?&quot;
											Told him my idea, and you know,
											he is one of the bravest men in the world,
											as is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment.

									<p>
											Within 10 days, I was down at Fort Dix.
											He gave me my pick of units.
											I picked one unit — Charlie Company, Third of the 172nd,
											they&#39;re mountain infantry — for two reasons.
											One, they&#39;re infantry.
											Number two, they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda,
											so I knew they would have Internet access.
											The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer.
											This was a big thing that
											I think when Major H told me,
											I wasn&#39;t really totally gathering what that would mean.

									<p>
											So what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix,
											I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.
											You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got.
											The opening one was,
											&quot;What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?&quot;
											I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.
											Gave them about a nine minute response,
											and there we went.

											So, I&#39;d like to show the clip of the film.

											many of you may not have had a chance to see it.
											So, I want to show the trailer,
											and then I&#39;m going to take apart one scene in detail.

											One of the things I&#39;d like to talk to you about

											And I&#39;d like to relate an experience I had here at TED.
											I don&#39;t know how many of you might imagine it,
											but there&#39;s actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.
											Paul? Come on, stand up.
											This is Paul Anthony.
											He served — (Applause) — with the Marines,
											and I want to tell you a little, brief story.
											We were one of the lucky ones
											to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.
											Right? And we started talking.
											People will see my tag, and they&#39;ll see &quot;The War Tapes,&quot;
											and then we&#39;ll start talking about war.

											We got in a conversation with some other people in the class,
											and it went on and on.
											I mean, we were there for an hour, talking.
											And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask
											you guys to think about and hopefully to help with,
											which is, I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war,
											and about politics.
											And really — because maybe we&#39;re going to disagree.
											Maybe it&#39;s going to get uncomfortable.
											How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?
											And you know, Paul was talking,
											and he then turned to Constance and said,
											&quot;You know, I wouldn&#39;t have this conversation if she weren&#39;t here,

											You know, I can answer questions about my movie,

											This film was not about the Internet,
											but it could not have been made without it.
											The guys&#39; tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.
											In the meantime, the soldiers — we would email and IM.
											I didn&#39;t save all of them,
											because I didn&#39;t realize at the beginning
											that it would be something that I would want to keep track of.
											But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages
											that I was able to save.
											The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey
											to really get inside of it.
											So I wanted to show you a clip,

											The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email,

											And the tone from the email was,

											And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base.
											So, I pinged Mike and I said,
											&quot;Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?&quot;
											Because the thing that very often is missing is,
											in the military what they call &quot;hot wash.&quot;
											It&#39;s that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know.

											American soldiers saying,
											&quot;Why don&#39;t they talk about the good stuff that we do?&quot;

											There were not Americans hurt out there.
											They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives —

											And I&#39;ve learned over time that those are always the soldiers.
											And they wait until pretty much everybody&#39;s gone.
											And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me,
											that then became my story, was —
											for those of you who haven&#39;t seen the film, and it&#39;s not a spoiler —
											it&#39;s very common there are a lot of civilian accidents,
											where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.
											In this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed.
											A soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close,

											He&#39;s a big guy.
											And he looked at me, and I smiled,
											and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.
											And he wasn&#39;t going to blink.
											And he said, &quot;My gunner was throwing candy.&quot;
											And I knew what he was going to say.

											And he said, &quot;I killed a child.
											And I&#39;m a father. I have children.
											I haven&#39;t been able to tell my wife.
											I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s going to think I&#39;m a monster.&quot;
											I hugged him, of course,
											and I said, you know, &quot;It&#39;s going to be OK.&quot;
											And he said, &quot;I&#39;m going to bring her to see your film.
											And then I&#39;m going to tell her.&quot;

											So when I talk about a disconnect,
											it&#39;s not only for maybe those people who don&#39;t know a soldier,
											which there obviously are. You know, these days,
											it&#39;s not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front,
											and everybody seemed involved.
											You can go for days here and not feel like there&#39;s a war going on.
											And often, I&#39;ll hear people say,
											who maybe know that I did this film,
											and they say, &quot;Oh, you know, I&#39;m against the war, but I support the soldiers.&quot;
											And I&#39;ve started to ask them,
											&quot;Well, that&#39;s nice. What are you doing?
											Are you volunteering at a VA?
											You go and see anybody?
											Do you, if you find out your neighbor&#39;s been, do you spend some time?
											Not necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?
											Do you give money to any of the charities?&quot;
											You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen&#39;s working on that amazing thing,
											but there&#39;s charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers.

											I think, I challenge us to say —
											to operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know?
											Are you a friend to them?
											Do you really care?
											And I would just say it&#39;s my hope, and I would ask you guys
											to please, you know, reach out a hand.
											And really do give them a hug.
											Thank you.
