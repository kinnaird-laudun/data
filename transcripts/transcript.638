											Good morning.
											Happy to see so many fine folks out here
											and so many smiling faces.
											I have a very peculiar
											background, attitude and approach
											to the real world
											because I am a conjurer.
											Now, I prefer that term over magician,
											because if I were a magician, that would mean
											that I use spells and incantations
											and weird gestures
											in order to accomplish real magic.
											No, I don&#39;t do that; I&#39;m a conjurer,
											who is someone who pretends to be
											a real magician. (Laughter)

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?
											We depend on the fact
											that audiences, such as yourselves,
											will make assumptions.
											For example, when I walked up here
											and I took the microphone from the stand
											and switched it on,
											you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.
											(Laughter)
											As a matter of fact, this is something
											that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.
											It&#39;s a beard trimmer, you see?
											And it makes a very bad microphone;
											I&#39;ve tried it many times. (Laughter)
											The other assumption that you made —
											and this little lesson is to show you
											that you will make assumptions.
											Not only that you can, but that you will
											when they are properly suggested to you.
											You believe I&#39;m looking at you.
											Wrong. I&#39;m not looking at you. I can&#39;t see you.
											I know you&#39;re out there, they told me backstage, it&#39;s a full house and such.
											I know you&#39;re there because I can hear you,
											but I can&#39;t see you because I normally wear glasses.
											These are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter)
											Quite empty frames.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now why would a grown man appear before you
											wearing empty frames on his face?
											To fool you, ladies and gentlemen,
											to deceive you, to show that you, too,
											can make assumptions.
											Don&#39;t you ever forget that.
											Now, I have to do something — first of all, switch to real glasses
											so I can actually see you,
											which would probably be a convenience. I don&#39;t know.
											I haven&#39;t had a good look. Well, it&#39;s not that great a convenience.

											I have to do something now, which seems
											a little bit strange for a magician.
											But I&#39;m going to take some medication.
											This is a full bottle of
											Calms Forte.
											I&#39;ll explain that in just a moment.
											Ignore the instructions,
											that&#39;s what the government has to put in there
											to confuse you, I&#39;m sure.
											I will take enough of these. Mm.
											Indeed, the whole container.
											Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.

									<p>
											Now that I&#39;ve done that — I&#39;ll explain it in a moment —
											I must tell you that
											I am an actor.
											I&#39;m an actor who plays a specific part.
											I play the part of a magician,
											a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.
											If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me
											and actually claim to be
											an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,
											you would be insulted
											and rightly so.
											Why would a man assume that you would believe
											something bizarre like this?
											But there exists out there
											a very large population
											of people who will tell you
											that they have psychic, magical powers
											that they can predict the future,
											that they can make contact with the deceased.
											Oh, they also say
											they will sell you astrology
											or other fortunetelling methods.
											Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.
											And they also say
											that they can give you perpetual motion machines
											and free energy systems.
											They claim to be psychics,
											or sensitives, whatever they can.

											But the one thing that has made a big comeback
											just recently
											is this business of
											speaking with the dead.
											Now, to my innocent mind,
											dead implies
											incapable of communicating. (Laughter)
											You might agree with me on that.
											But these people, they tend to tell you that
											not only can they communicate with the dead —
											&quot;Hi, there&quot; —
											but they can hear the dead as well,
											and they can relay this information back to the living.
											I wonder if that&#39;s true.
											I don&#39;t think so, because
											this subculture of people
											use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,
											exactly the same —
											the same physical methods, the same psychological methods —
											and they effectively and profoundly
											deceive millions of people around the earth,
											to their detriment.
											They deceive these people,
											costs them a lot of money,
											cost them a lot of emotional anguish.
											Billions of dollars are spent
											every year, all over the globe,
											on these charlatans.

											Now, I have two questions
											I would like to ask these people
											if I had the opportunity to do so.
											First question: If I want to ask them to call up —
											because they do hear them through the ear.
											They listen to the spirits like this —
											I&#39;m going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother
											because, when she died, she had the family will,
											and she secreted it someplace. We don&#39;t know where it is,
											so we ask Granny, &quot;Where is the will, Granny?&quot;
											What does Granny say? She says, &quot;I&#39;m in heaven and it&#39;s wonderful.
											I&#39;m here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,
											and my family
											and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.
											And I love you, and I&#39;ll always be with you.
											Good bye.&quot;
											And she didn&#39;t answer the damn question!
											Where is the will?
											Now, she could easily have said,
											&quot;Oh, it&#39;s in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,&quot;
											but she doesn&#39;t say that. No, she doesn&#39;t.
											She doesn&#39;t bring any useful information to us.
											We paid a lot of money for that information,
											be we didn&#39;t get it.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The second question that I&#39;d like to ask, rather simple:
											Suppose I ask them to contact
											the spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.
											Why do they insist on saying —
											remember, they speak into this ear —
											why do they say, &quot;My name starts with J or M?&quot;
											Is this a hunting game?
											Hunting and fishing? What is it?
											Is it 20 questions? No, it&#39;s more like 120 questions.
											But it is a cruel, vicious,
											absolutely conscienceless —
											I&#39;ll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) —
											game that these people play.
											And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,
											the grieving, the needy people out there.

											Now, this is a process
											that is called cold reading.
											There&#39;s one fellow out there,
											Van Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.
											He&#39;s one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.
											John Edward, Sylvia Browne
											and Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.
											There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,
											James Van Praagh is very big.
											And what does he do? He likes to tell you
											how the deceased got deceased,
											the people he&#39;s talking to through his ear, you see?
											So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,
											&quot;He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,
											that he had trouble breathing.&quot;
											Folks, that&#39;s what dying is all about!
											(Laughter)
											You stop breathing, and then you&#39;re dead.
											It&#39;s that simple.
											And that&#39;s the kind of information they&#39;re going to bring back to you?
											I don&#39;t think so.
											Now, these people will make guesses, they&#39;ll say things like,
											&quot;Why am I getting electricity?
											He&#39;s saying to me, &#39;Electricity.&#39;
											Was he an electrician?&quot; &quot;No.&quot;
											&quot;Did he ever have an electric razor?&quot; &quot;No.&quot;
											It was a game of hunting questions like this.
											This is what they go through.

											Now, folks often ask us
											at the James Randi Educational Foundation,
											they call me, they say, &quot;Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?
											Isn&#39;t it just a lot of fun?&quot;
											No, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.
											Now, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,
											but that comfort lasts
											only about 20 minutes or so.
											And then the people look in the mirror, and they say,
											I just paid a lot of money for that reading.
											And what did she say to me? &#39;I love you!&#39;&quot;
											They always say that.
											They don&#39;t get any information,
											they don&#39;t get any value for what they spend.

											Now, Sylvia Browne — just to show you —
											she actually gets 700 dollars

											she doesn&#39;t even go there in person,

											She gives you the names of previous lives,

											Duh.
											It turns out that the women

											Nothing is ever said about

											Now, Sylvia Browne is an exception,

											Sylvia Browne is an exception in that

											Now, I popped some pills earlier.

											Homeopathy, let&#39;s find out what that&#39;s all about.
											Hmm. You&#39;ve heard of it.
											It&#39;s an alternative form of healing, right?
											Homeopathy actually consists — and that&#39;s what this is.
											This is Calms Forte,
											32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.
											I just ingested
											six and a half days worth of sleeping pills.
											(Laughter)
											Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.
											It says right on the back here,
											&quot;In case of overdose,

											Why don&#39;t they affect me?

											(Applause)
											The answer may surprise you.
											What is homeopathy?
											It&#39;s taking a medicine that really works
											and diluting it down
											well beyond Avogadro&#39;s limit.
											Diluting it down to the point
											where there&#39;s none of it left. (Laughter)
											Now folks, this is not
											just a metaphor I&#39;m going to give you now, it&#39;s true.
											It&#39;s exactly equivalent to taking
											one 325 milligram aspirin tablet,
											throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,
											and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,
											and waiting two years or so
											until the solution is homogeneous.
											Then, when you get a headache,
											you take a sip of this water, and — voila! — it is gone.

											Those are very important,

											The rotting of the human mind,
											the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult

											all of this total nonsense,
											this medieval thinking —
											I think something should be done about that,

											There&#39;s nothing like sitting in that library
