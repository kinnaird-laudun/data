											The immersive ugliness

											You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.
											And it&#39;s a tremendous problem for us.
											The outstanding — the salient problem about this for us
											is that these are places that are not worth caring about.
											We&#39;re going to talk about that some more.
											A sense of place:
											your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character
											depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,
											and to employ the vocabularies, grammars,
											syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture
											in order to inform us who we are.

											The public realm in America has two roles:
											it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,
											and it is the physical manifestation of the common good.
											And when you degrade the public realm,
											you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life
											and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.
											The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America
											because we don&#39;t have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas
											and market squares of older cultures.
											And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about
											all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.
											This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle
											that we threw in the garbage after World War II
											and decided we don&#39;t need that anymore; we&#39;re not going to use it.
											And consequently, we can see the result all around us.
											The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,
											but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
											Where we&#39;ve come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,
											by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we&#39;re going
											in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.
											And if there is one tremendous —
											if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we&#39;ve built,
											the human environments we&#39;ve made for ourselves in the last 50 years,
											it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.

											The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these.
											You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.
											And remember, to create a place of character and quality,
											you have to be able to define space.
											So how is that being accomplished here?
											If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here
											and try to look at the Target store over here,
											you can&#39;t see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)
											That&#39;s nature&#39;s way of telling you that you&#39;re doing a poor job of defining space.
											Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.
											These will be places that are not worth caring about.

											and ask yourself, &quot;What is their last thought of home?&quot;
											I hope it&#39;s not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store

											Public space. This is a good public space.
											It&#39;s a place worth caring about. It&#39;s well defined.
											It is emphatically an outdoor public room.
											It has something that is terribly important —
											it has what&#39;s called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.
											That&#39;s a fancy way of saying it&#39;s got shops, bars, bistros, destinations —
											things go in and out of it. It&#39;s permeable.
											The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,
											and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.
											You know, in these places in other cultures,
											people just go there voluntarily because they like them.
											We don&#39;t have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)
											You know, you don&#39;t have to have a Kwanzaa festival.

											designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:
											Boston City Hall Plaza.
											A public place so dismal that the winos don&#39;t even want to go there. (Laughter)
											And we can&#39;t fix it because I.M. Pei&#39;s still alive,
											and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.
											And every year they fail to because they don&#39;t want to hurt I.M. Pei&#39;s feelings.

											The pattern of Main Street USA —
											in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.
											It&#39;s not that complicated:
											buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,
											so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.
											Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs,
											you know, apartments, offices, and so on.
											You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.
											They haven&#39;t learned that in Monterey.
											If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,
											you&#39;ll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.

											Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,
											and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,
											when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?
											So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.
											OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,
											where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)
											Of course, they&#39;ll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.
											Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,
											we pop a handicapped ramp on that,
											and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.
											And that&#39;s how we do it.
											I call them &quot;nature Band-Aids&quot; because there&#39;s a general idea in America
											that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.
											And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.
											Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
											You know, that&#39;s not good enough.
											We have to do good buildings.

											to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,
											and to soften the hardscape of the buildings

											You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding
											of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.
											They&#39;re not the same thing.
											And we&#39;re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,
											which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.
											Here you see it on a small scale — the mothership has landed,

											A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma
											that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,
											city life, and everything connected with it.
											And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,
											is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,
											which is going to be life in the country for everybody.
											And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:
											the country villa along the railroad line,
											which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,
											but to return to the countryside every night.
											And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,
											so it really was a form of country living.

											But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years

											It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.
											And that&#39;s the great non-articulated agony of suburbia
											and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.
											Because it hasn&#39;t delivered what it&#39;s been promising for half a century now.

											And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.
											Basically, a house with nothing on the side
											because this house wants to state, emphatically,
											&quot;I&#39;m a little cabin in the woods. There&#39;s nothing on either side of me.
											I don&#39;t have any eyes on the side of my head. I can&#39;t see.&quot;

											We know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,

											Because these places, these habitats,

											And we should have started two days before yesterday.
											We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,
											excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage
											by our parents&#39; generation after World War II.
											Because we&#39;re going to need it if we&#39;re going to learn how to reconstruct towns.
											We&#39;re going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill
											in order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,
											that allow — that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life
											and our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.

											So that, you know, the residences make sense
											deployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.
											We&#39;re going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:
											the street, the block, how to compose public space that&#39;s both large and small,
											the courtyard, the civic square
											and how to really make use of this property.
											We can see some of the first ideas
											for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.
											The dead malls: what are we going to do with them?
											Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.
											They&#39;re not going to be retro-fitted;

											Some of them we&#39;re going to fix, though.
											And we&#39;re going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems
											and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.
											And if we&#39;re lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers
											in our existing towns and cities.
											And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were
											because they occupy all the important sites.

											We are sleepwalking into the future.
											We&#39;re not ready for what&#39;s coming at us.

											One final thing — I&#39;ve been very disturbed about this for years,
											but I think it&#39;s particularly important for this audience.
											Please, please, stop referring to yourselves as &quot;consumers.&quot; OK?
											Consumers are different than citizens.
											Consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties
											to their fellow human beings.
											And as long as you&#39;re using that word consumer in the public discussion,
											you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we&#39;re having.
											And we&#39;re going to continue being clueless
											going into this very difficult future that we face.
											So thank you very much.
											Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about
											and a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)
