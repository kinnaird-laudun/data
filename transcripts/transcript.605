											So, what I&#39;m going to do is
											just give you the latest episode of India&#39;s —
											maybe the world&#39;s — longest running soap opera,
											which is cricket.
											And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.
											It&#39;s got everything that you&#39;d want a normal soap opera to want:
											It&#39;s got love, joy, happiness,
											sadness, tears, laughter,
											lots of deceit, intrigue.
											And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years
											when the audience interest changes.
											And that&#39;s exactly what cricket has done.
											It&#39;s jumped 20 years
											into 20-over game.
											And that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to talk about,
											how a small change
											leads to a very big revolution.

											But it wasn&#39;t always like that.
											Cricket wasn&#39;t always this
											speed-driven generations game.
											There was a time when you played cricket,
											you played timeless test matches,
											when you played on till the game got over.
											And there was this game in March 1939
											that started on the third of March
											and ended on the 14th of March.
											And it only ended because the English cricketers
											had to go from Durban to Cape Town,
											which is a two-hour train journey,
											to catch the ship that left on the 17th,
											because the next ship wasn&#39;t around for a long time.
											So, the match was ended in between.
											And one of the English batsmen said, &quot;You know what?
											Another half an hour and we would have won.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											Another half an hour after 12 days.
											There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,
											so you don&#39;t play on Sundays. And one day it rained,
											so they all sat around making friends with each other.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:
											because we had about the same pace of life.
											(Laughter)
											The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn&#39;t it?
											You fought by day, then it was sunset,
											so everyone went back home.
											And then you worked out your strategy,
											and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.
											The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was
											that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.
											Princes patronize the game,
											not because they love the game,
											but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves
											to the British rulers.

									<p>
											But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,
											which was, all you needed was a plank of wood
											and a rubber ball, and any number of people
											could play it anywhere.
											Take a look:
											You could play it in the dump
											with some rocks over there,
											you could play it in a little alley —
											you couldn&#39;t hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;
											don&#39;t forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.
											(Laughter)
											You could play it on the banks of the Ganges —
											that&#39;s as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.
											Or you could play many games in one small patch of land,
											even if you didn&#39;t know which game you were actually in.
											(Laughter)
											As you can see, you can play anywhere.
											But slowly the game moved on,
											you know, finally.

											You don&#39;t always have five days. So, we moved on,
											and we started playing 50-over cricket.
											And then an enormous accident took place.
											In Indian sport we don&#39;t make things happen,
											accidents happen and we&#39;re in the right place at the right time, sometimes.
											And we won this World Cup in 1983.
											And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,
											and we played it virtually every day.
											There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.

											But there was another big date.
											1983 was when we won the World Cup.
											1991,&#39;92, we found a finance minister
											and a prime minister
											willing to let the world look at India,
											rather than be this great country of intrigue
											and mystery in this closed country.
											And so we allowed multinationals into India.
											We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,
											and we got all the multinationals coming in,
											with multinational budgets,
											who looked at per-capita income
											and got very excited about the possibilities in India,
											and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.

											And there are only two vehicles in India — one real, one scripted.
											The scripted one is what you see in the movies,
											the real one was cricket.
											And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,
											Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he&#39;s going to take it
											all over the world.
											And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.
											And so cricket started becoming big;
											cricket started bringing riches in.
											Television started covering cricket. For a long time

											Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.
											The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman
											thought the bowler was bowling fast.
											(Laughter)
											If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,
											but it didn&#39;t go. And we suddenly discovered
											that we could be good at this game.
											And what it also did was
											it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.
											It was at a time when investment was coming in,
											India was feeling a little more confident about itself.
											And so there was a feeling that there was great pride
											in what we can do.
											And thankfully for all of us,
											the English are very good at inventing things,
											and then the gracious people that they are,
											they let the world become very good at it.
											(Laughter)
											And so England invented T20 cricket,
											and allowed India to hijack it.
											It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,
											we just took it straight away, as is.

											And so, we launched our own T20 league.
											Six weeks, city versus city.
											It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country —
											the only two areas in which India was very proud about
											their country, representing itself on the field.
											One was war, the Indian army, which we don&#39;t like to happen very often.
											The other was Indian cricket.
											Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.
											But the people getting into these city leagues
											were people who were taking their cues from the West.
											America is a home of leagues. And they said,
											&quot;Right, we&#39;ll build some glitzy leagues here in India.&quot;
											But was India ready for it?
											Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.
											It was never promoted, it was never sold — it was organized.
											And look what they did with our beautiful, nice,
											simple family game.
											All of a sudden, you had that happening.

											The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.
											They were not bureaucrats who were forced
											into sport because they didn&#39;t actually love it;
											these were people who ran serious companies.
											And so they started promoting cricket big time,
											started promoting clubs big time.
											And they&#39;ve started promoting them with huge money behind it.
											I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars
											before a ball was bowled,
											1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,
											and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises
											that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,
											but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.
											But what they were very good at doing
											was making it very localized.
											So, just to give you an example of how they did it —
											not Manchester United style promotion,
											but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.

											Of course, a lot of people said, &quot;Maybe they dance better than they play.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											But that&#39;s all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.
											All along, if you wanted a young cricketer,
											you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,
											your own city, and you were very proud
											of the system that produced those cricketers.
											Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot —
											if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,
											they needn&#39;t go to Kalbadevi
											or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,
											they could go to Trinidad.
											This was the new India, wasn&#39;t it? This was the new world,
											where you can source from anywhere
											as long as you get the best product at the best price.
											And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality
											that you can source the best product for the best price
											anywhere in the world.

											So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,
											overnight. And when he had to go back to represent
											the West Indies, they asked him, &quot;When do you have to reach?&quot;
											He said, &quot;I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today.&quot;
											We said, &quot;No, no, no. It&#39;s not about when you have to leave;
											it&#39;s about when do you have to reach there?&quot;
											And so he said, &quot;I&#39;ve got to reach on date X.&quot;
											And they said, &quot;Fine, you play to date X, minus one.&quot;
											So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,
											went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,
											sat in a private corporate jet — first refueling in Portugal,
											second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.
											(Laughter)
											Never would India have thought on this scale before.
											Never would India have said, &quot;I want a player to play
											one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet
											to send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica
											to play a game.&quot;
											And I just thought to myself,
											&quot;Wow, we&#39;ve arrived somewhere in the world, you know?

											But what this also did was it started
											marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,
											which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.
											There is cricket and the movies.
											And they came together because people in the movies
											now started owning clubs.
											And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.
											They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.
											And something very interesting happened.
											We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.
											And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.
											And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta&#39;s team —
											as you will see on the clip that follows — if you did well,
											you got a hug from Preity Zinta.
											So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look —

											IPL became the biggest brand in India

											For a long time, India was this country of poverty,
											dust, beggars,

											Delhi belly — people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.
											And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.
											Cricketers all over the world said,

											And that felt good, you know?
											We said, &quot;The dollar&#39;s quite powerful actually.&quot;
											Can you imagine, you&#39;ve got the dollar on view
											and there&#39;s no Delhi belly in there anymore.
											There&#39;s no filth, there&#39;s no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,

											Right so, finally,
											an English game that India usurped a little bit,

											If you want to take the game around the world,
											it&#39;s got to be the shortest form of the game.
											You can&#39;t take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,
											or you can&#39;t take it all over the world.
											So that&#39;s what T20 is doing.
											Hopefully, it&#39;ll make everyone richer, hopefully it&#39;ll make the game bigger
