<title>Sally Kohn: What we can do about the culture of hate | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We&#39;re all against hate, right? We agree it&#39;s a problem -- their problem, not our problem, that is. But as Sally Kohn discovered, we all hate -- some of us in subtle ways, others in obvious ones. As she confronts a hard story from her own life, she shares ideas on how we can recognize, challenge and heal from hatred in our institutions and in ourselves." />

											My clearest memory
is standing in the empty hallway

to come out of the bathroom,
											and I have a clipboard and a pen
and a survey I&#39;ve made up,
											asking about shampoo preferences,
											like I&#39;m doing a study
for science class or something.
											And when Vicky comes out of the bathroom,
											I pounce on her and I ask her
what shampoo she uses.
											Now, to put this in perspective,
											I can&#39;t remember the names of my teachers,
											I can&#39;t remember the names
of any of the books I read that year,
											I pretty much can&#39;t remember
anything from fifth grade,
											but I remember that Vicky told me
she used White Rain shampoo.
											Clear as yesterday,
											like it just happened.
											And as classes let out,
											I ran down the hall shouting
at all the other kids,
											&quot;Sticky Vicky uses White Rain shampoo.
											Don&#39;t use White Rain shampoo

											Gordon Allport,
											the psychologist who pioneered
the study of hate in the early 1900s,
											developed what he called
a &quot;scale of prejudice.&quot;
											At one end are things like genocide
and other bias-motivated violence.
											But at the other end
											are things like believing
that your in-group
											is inherently superior to some out-group,
											or avoiding social interaction
with those others.
											Isn&#39;t that all hate?
											I mean, it wasn&#39;t an accident
											that I was a rich kid
picking on a poor kid,
											or that Vicky, it turns out,
would eventually end up being gay.
											Poor kids and gay kids
are more likely to be bullied,
											even by kids who also end up being gay.
											I know there was a lot going on
in my little 10-year-old mind.
											I&#39;m not saying hate was the only
reason I picked on Vicky
											or even that I was consciously
hateful or anything,
											but the fact is,
											the people we discriminate against
in our public policies and in our culture
											are also the groups of people
most likely to be bullied in school.

											I am defining hate in a broad way
											because I think we have a big problem.
											And we need to solve all of it,
not just the most extremes.
											So for instance,
											we probably all agree
that marching down the street,
											chanting about you should take away
rights from some group of people
											because of their skin color
or their gender,
											we&#39;d all agree that&#39;s hate, right? OK.
											What if you believe
that group of people is inferior,

											Is that hate?
											Or what if you believe
that group of people is inferior

											what&#39;s known as implicit bias.
											Is that hate?
											I mean they all have
the same roots, don&#39;t they?

of racism and sexism

											Let me give you just one example
of the former terrorist I spent time with
											in the West Bank.
											When Bassam Aramin was 16 years old,
											he tried to blow up an Israeli
military convoy with a grenade.
											He failed, fortunately,
											but he was still sentenced
to seven years in prison.
											When he was in prison,
they showed a film about the Holocaust.
											Up until that point,
											Bassam had thought the Holocaust
was mostly a myth.
											He went to go watch the film
											because he thought he would enjoy
seeing Jews get killed.
											But when he saw what really happened,
he broke down crying.
											And eventually, after prison,
											Bassam went on to get
a master&#39;s degree in Holocaust studies
											and he founded an organization
where former Palestinian combatants
											and Israeli combatants come together,
											work together, try to find common ground.
											By his own account,
Bassam used to hate Israelis,
											but through knowing Israelis
and learning their stories
											and working together for peace,
											he overcame his hate.
											Bassam says he still
doesn&#39;t hate Israelis,
											even after the Israeli military —
											shot and killed his [10]-year-old
daughter, Abir,
											while she was walking to school.

											If a former terrorist ...
											if a terrorist can learn to stop hating
											and still not hate
when their child is killed,
											surely the rest of us can stop our habits
											of demeaning and dehumanizing each other.
											And I will tell you there are stories
like Bassam&#39;s all over the world,
											plus study after study after study
											that says, no, we are neither designed
nor destined as human beings to hate,
											but rather taught to hate
by the world around us.
											I promise you,
											none of us pops out of the womb
hating black people or Republicans.
											There is nothing in our DNA
that makes us hate Muslims or Mexicans.
											For better or for worse,
											we are all a product
of the culture around us.
											And the good news is,
											we&#39;re also the ones
who shape that culture,
											which means we can change it.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The first step is starting to recognize
the hate inside ourselves.
											We need to catch ourselves
											and our hateful thoughts
in all their forms
											in all of us ...
											and work to challenge
our ideas and assumptions.
											That doesn&#39;t happen overnight,
											I am telling you right here,
											it is a lifelong journey,
but it&#39;s one we all need to take.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then second:
											if we want to challenge
the hate in our societies,
											we need to promote policies
and institutions and practices
											that connect us as communities.
											Literally, like integrated
neighborhoods and schools.
											That by the way is the reason
to support integration.
											Not just because
it&#39;s the right thing to do,
											but because integration
systematically combats hate.
											There are studies
that teenagers who participate
											in racially integrated classes
and activities reduce their racial bias.
											And when little kids go to racially
integrated kindergartens
											and elementary schools —
											they develop less bias to begin with.
											But the fact is in so many ways
and in so many places around our world,
											we are separated from each other.
											In the United States, for instance,
											three-quarters of white people
don&#39;t have any non-white friends.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So in addition to promoting
those proactive solutions,
											the other thing we need to do
is upend the hate in our institutions
											and our policies
											that perpetuate dehumanization
and difference
											and otherizing and hate,
											like systems of sexual harassment
and sexual assault in the workplace,
											or our deeply racially imbalanced
											and deeply racially biased
criminal &quot;justice&quot; system.
											We need to change that.
											Again, it will not happen overnight.
											It needs to happen.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then ...
											when we connect together
											in these connection spaces,
											facilitated by connection systems,
											we need to change the way
we talk to each other
											and connect with one another
											and relate with generosity
and open-mindedness
											and kindness and compassion
											and not hate.
											And that&#39;s it.
											That&#39;s it.

											but that&#39;s pretty much all we have to do.
											It&#39;s not that complicated, right?
											But it&#39;s hard.
											The hate that we feel
