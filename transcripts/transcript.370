											AM: Yeah. Well, I guess I&#39;ve always been involved in sports.
											I played softball for five years growing up.
											I skied competitively throughout high school,
											and I got a little restless in college
											because I wasn&#39;t doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.
											And I&#39;d never competed on a disabled level, you know —
											I&#39;d always competed against other able-bodied athletes.
											That&#39;s all I&#39;d ever known.
											In fact, I&#39;d never even met another amputee until I was 17.
											And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners,
											and I figured, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know about this,
											but before I judge it, let me go see what it&#39;s all about.&quot;
											So, I booked myself a flight to Boston in &#39;95, 19 years old
											and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I&#39;d never done it before.
											I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet
											to see how far I could run, 

											and about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.
											And I had these legs that were made of
											a wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps —
											big, thick, five-ply wool socks on —
											you know, not the most comfortable things, but all I&#39;d ever known.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And I&#39;m up there in Boston against people
											wearing legs made of all things — carbon graphite
											and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things —
											and they&#39;re all looking at me like,
											OK, we know who&#39;s not going to win this race.
											And, I mean, I went up there expecting —
											I don&#39;t know what I was expecting —
											but, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg
											go up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump
											and clear it at six feet, two inches ...
											Dan O&#39;Brien jumped 5&#39;11&quot; in &#39;96 in Atlanta,
											I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of —
											these are truly accomplished athletes,
											without qualifying that word &quot;athlete.&quot;
											And so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding,
											I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder
											by three hundredths of a second,

											but you don&#39;t have any skill or finesse going down that track.
											You were all over the place.

											He&#39;s coached five Olympians, and

											That&#39;s all I wanted — just two practices.
											&quot;Can I just sit in and see what you do?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything.&quot;
											You know, he&#39;s thinking, &quot;What am I getting myself into?&quot;
											So, I met the man, walked in his office,
											and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached.
											And we got to talking,
											and it turned out to be a great partnership
											because he&#39;d never coached a disabled athlete,
											so therefore he had no preconceived notions
											of what I was or wasn&#39;t capable of,

											So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break,
											his free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.
											So that&#39;s how I met Frank.
											That was fall of &#39;95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around,
											he said, &quot;You know, you&#39;re good enough.
											You can run on our women&#39;s track team here.&quot;
											And I said, &quot;No, come on.&quot;
											And he said, &quot;No, no, really. You can.
											You can run with our women&#39;s track team.&quot;
											In the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team
											that May coming up full speed, I joined the women&#39;s track team.
											And no disabled person had ever done that — run at a collegiate level.
											So I don&#39;t know, it started to become an interesting mix.

											AM: Okay, well, Atlanta.
											The Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification,
											are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities —
											amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes —
											as opposed to the Special Olympics,
											which deals with people with mental disabilities.
											So, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta,
											and I&#39;m just blown away by the fact that
											just a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn&#39;t run 50 meters.
											And so, here I am — never lost.
											I set new records at the U.S. Nationals — the Olympic trials — that May,
											and was sure that I was coming home with the gold.
											I was also the only, what they call &quot;bilateral BK&quot; — below the knee.
											I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.
											I had just done the long jump,
											and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says,
											&quot;How do you do that? You know, we&#39;re supposed to have a planar foot,
											so we can&#39;t get off on the springboard.&quot;
											I said, &quot;Well, I just did it. No one told me that.&quot;

											So, it&#39;s funny — I&#39;m three inches within the world record —
											and kept on from that point, you know,
											so I&#39;m signed up in the long jump — signed up?
											No, I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.
											And I&#39;m sure of it, you know?
											I made the front page of my hometown paper
											that I delivered for six years, you know?
											It was, like, this is my time for shine. 

											And we&#39;re at the trainee warm-up track,
											which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.
											These legs that I was on, which I&#39;ll take out right now —
											I was the first person in the world on these legs.
											I was the guinea pig., I&#39;m telling you,
											this was, like — talk about a tourist attraction.

											you know, &quot;Who am I running against here?&quot;
											&quot;Oh, Aimee, we&#39;ll have to get back to you on that one.&quot;
											I wanted to find out times.
											&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re doing great.&quot;
											This is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium,
											and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look.
											And my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.
											Then I&#39;m looking: the next lane, lane two, is 12.8.
											Lane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

											And the gun went off, and all I remember was
											finishing last and
											fighting back tears of frustration and incredible — incredible —

											And I had to think, &quot;Why did I do this?&quot;
											If I had won everything — but it was like, what was the point?

											I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.

											AM: It&#39;s a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot.
											And I was a guinea pig, as I hope to continue to be
											in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.
											But actually these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.
											I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know,

											AM: Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth, England,
											about two hours south of London,
											and I&#39;m the only person in the United States with these,
											which is a crime because they are so beautiful.
											And I don&#39;t even mean, like, because of the toes and everything.
											For me, while I&#39;m such a serious athlete on the track,
											I want to be feminine off the track, and I think it&#39;s so important
											not to be limited in any capacity,
											whether it&#39;s, you know, your mobility or even fashion.
											I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere
											and pick out what I want — the shoes I want, the skirts I want —
											and I&#39;m hoping to try to bring these over here
											and make them accessible to a lot of people.
											They&#39;re also silicon.
											This is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.
											It&#39;s like a Barbie foot under this.

											It is. It&#39;s just stuck in this position,
											so I have to wear a two-inch heel.
											And, I mean, it&#39;s really — let me take this off so you can see it.
											I don&#39;t know how good you can see it, but, like, it really is.
											There&#39;re veins on the feet, and then my heel is pink,
											and my Achilles&#39; tendon — that moves a little bit.
											And it&#39;s really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago.
											And this is just a silicon piece of skin.

Mullins, an athlete, a model and an actress with both legs amputated below the knees. She compared prosthetic legs to eyeglasses, and in the same way that we wear designer eyeglasses she has designer legs (she was wearing her 4-inch heel legs for the talk). She made it clear that with enough attitude you could pull off anything as she left the crowd dumbstruck with her presence.","whotheyare":"A record-breaker at the Paralympic Games in 1996, Aimee Mullins has built a career as a model, actor and advocate for women, sports and the next generation of prosthetics.

At Georgetown, where she double-majored in history and diplomacy, she became the first double amputee to compete in NCAA Division 1 track and field.</p><p>After school, Mullins did some modeling -- including a legendary runway show for Alexander McQueen -- and then turned to acting, appearing as the Leopard Queen in Matthew Barney&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.cremaster.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Cremaster</a>  Cycle.
