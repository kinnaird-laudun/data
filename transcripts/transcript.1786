<title>Melissa Fleming: Let&#39;s help refugees thrive, not just survive | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Today&#39;s refugee crisis is the biggest since World War II, and it&#39;s growing. When this talk was given, 50 million people had been forcefully displaced from their homes by conflict and war; now the number is 65.3 million. There were 3 million Syrian refugees in 2014; now there are 4.9 million. Inside this overwhelming crisis are the individual human stories -- of care, growth and family, in the face of lost education, lost home, lost future. Melissa Fleming of the UN&#39;s refugee agency tells the refugees&#39; stories -- and asks us to help them rebuild their world." />

<meta content="Today's refugee crisis is the biggest since World War II, and it's growing. When this talk was given, 50 million people had been forcefully displaced from their homes by conflict and war; now the number is 65.3 million. There were 3 million Syrian refugees in 2014; now there are 4.9 million. Inside this overwhelming crisis are the individual human stories — of care, growth and family, in the face of lost education, lost home, lost future. Melissa Fleming of the UN's refugee agency tells the refugees' stories — and asks us to help them rebuild their world." itemprop='description'>

											So I started working
											with refugees because I wanted
											to make a difference,
											and making a difference starts
											with telling their stories.
											So when I meet refugees,
											I always ask them questions.
											Who bombed your house?
											Who killed your son?
											Did the rest of your family make it out alive?
											How are you coping
											in your life in exile?
											But there&#39;s one question that always seems to me
											to be most revealing, and that is:
											What did you take?
											What was that most important thing
											that you had to take with you
											when the bombs were exploding in your town,
											and the armed gangs were approaching your house?

											A Syrian refugee boy I know
											told me that he didn&#39;t hesitate
											when his life was in imminent danger.
											He took his high school diploma,
											and later he told me why.
											He said, &quot;I took my high school diploma
											because my life depended on it.&quot;
											And he would risk his life to get that diploma.
											On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.
											His classroom sometimes shook
											with the sound of bombs and shelling,
											and his mother told me,
											&quot;Every day, I would say to him every morning,
											&#39;Honey, please don&#39;t go to school.&#39;&quot;
											And when he insisted, she said,
											&quot;I would hug him as if it were for the last time.&quot;
											But he said to his mother,
											&quot;We&#39;re all afraid,
											but our determination to graduate
											is stronger than our fear.&quot;

											They left that day, right away, in their car,
											Hany hidden in the back because they were facing

											And they would cross the border into Lebanon,
											where they would find peace.
											But they would begin a life of grueling hardship
											and monotony.
											They had no choice but to build a shack
											on the side of a muddy field,
											and this is Hany&#39;s brother Ashraf,

											and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.
											There&#39;s not a town, a city or a village
											that is not host to Syrian refugees.
											This is generosity and humanity
											that is remarkable.
											Think about it this way, proportionately.
											It would be as if
											the entire population of Germany,
											80 million people,
											would flee to the United States in just three years.
											Half of the entire population of Syria
											is now uprooted,
											most of them inside the country.
											Six and a half million people
											have fled for their lives.
											Over and well over three million people
											have crossed the borders
											and have found sanctuary
in the neighboring countries,
											and only a small proportion, as you see,
											have moved on to Europe.
											What I find most worrying
											is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.
											I took this picture of this little girl.
											It was just two hours after she had arrived
											after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.

											And most troubling of all
											is that only 20 percent of 
Syrian refugee children
											are in school in Lebanon.
											And yet, Syrian refugee children,
											all refugee children tell us
											education is the most important thing in their lives.
											Why? Because it allows them to think of their future

											It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.

											I&#39;m reminded of a recent visit I took

											and I thought, &quot;She&#39;s beautiful,&quot;
											and I went up to her and asked her,
											&quot;Can I take your picture?&quot;
											And she said yes,
											but she refused to smile.
											I think she couldn&#39;t,
											because I think she must realize that she represents
											a lost generation of Syrian refugee children,
											a generation isolated and frustrated.
											And yet, look at what they fled:
											utter destruction,
											buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.
											Hany&#39;s home was also destroyed.
											This will need to be rebuilt
											by architects, by engineers, by electricians.
											Communities will need teachers and lawyers
											and politicians interested in reconciliation
											and not revenge.
											Shouldn&#39;t this be rebuilt
											by the people with the largest stake,
											the societies in exile, the refugees?

											Refugees have a lot of time
											to prepare for their return.
											You might imagine that being a refugee
											is just a temporary state.
											Well far from it.
											With wars going on and on,
											the average time a refugee will spend in exile
											is 17 years.
											Hany was into his second year in limbo
											when I went to visit him recently,
											and we conducted our entire conversation in English,
											which he confessed to me he learned
											from reading all of Dan Brown&#39;s novels
											and from listening to American rap.
											We also spent some nice moments of laughter
											and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.
											But I&#39;ll never forget what he told me
											when we ended our conversation that day.
											He said to me,
											&quot;If I am not a student, I am nothing.&quot;

											Hany is one of 50 million people
											uprooted in this world today.
											Never since World War II
											have so many people been forcibly displaced.
											So while we&#39;re making sweeping progress
											in human health,
											in technology, in education and design,
											we are doing dangerously little
											to help the victims
											and we are doing far too little
											to stop and prevent
											the wars that are driving them from their homes.

											And there are more and more victims.
											Every day, on average,
											by the end of this day,
											32,000 people will be forcibly displaced
											from their homes —
											32,000 people.
											They flee across borders like this one.
											We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,
											and this is a typical day.
											Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,
											risking their lives in this case
											just to reach safety in Europe.
											This Syrian young man
											survived one of these boats that capsized —
											most of the people drowned —
											and he told us,
											&quot;Syrians are just looking for a quiet place
											where nobody hurts you,
											where nobody humiliates you,
											and where nobody kills you.&quot;
											Well, I think that should be the minimum.
											How about a place of healing,
											of learning,
											and even opportunity?
											Americans and Europeans
											have the impression that proportionally
											huge numbers of refugees are coming
											to their country,
											but the reality is
											that 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,
											are living in the developing world,
											in countries struggling with their own insecurity,
											with their own issues of helping their own populations
											and poverty.
											So wealthy countries in the world should recognize
											the humanity and the generosity of the countries
											that are hosting so many refugees.
											And all countries should make sure that no one
											fleeing war and persecution
											arrives at a closed border.

											It makes so much sense,
											but I&#39;m reminded of the terrible war in Somalia
											that has been raging on for 22 years.
											And imagine living in this camp.
											I visited this camp.
											It&#39;s in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,
											and it was so remote
											that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.
											It was dusty and it was terribly hot.
											And we went to visit a school
											and started talking to the children,
											and then I saw this girl across the room
											who looked to me to be the same age
											as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.
											And I asked her the questions
											that grown-ups ask kids,
											like, &quot;What is your favorite subject?&quot;
											and, &quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;
											And this is when her face turned blank,
											and she said to me,
											&quot;I have no future.
											My schooling days are over.&quot;
											And I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,
											so I turned to my colleague
											and she confirmed to me
											there is no funding for secondary education
											in this camp.
											And how I wished at that moment
											that I could say to her,
											&quot;We will build you a school.&quot;
											And I also thought, what a waste.
											She should be and she is
											the future of Somalia.

											A boy named Jacob Atem

											He watched — this is in Sudan —

											Only his cousin survived, and the two of them

											So here is my point:
