<title>Deborah Gordon: What ants teach us about the brain, cancer and the Internet | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Ecologist Deborah Gordon studies ants wherever she can find them -- in the desert, in the tropics, in her kitchen ... In this fascinating talk, she explains her obsession with insects most of us would happily swat away without a second thought. She argues that ant life provides a useful model for learning about many other topics, including disease, technology and the human brain." />

<meta content='Ecologist Deborah Gordon studies ants wherever she can find them — in the desert, in the tropics, in her kitchen ... In this fascinating talk, she explains her obsession with insects most of us would happily swat away without a second thought. She argues that ant life provides a useful model for learning about many other topics, including disease, technology and the human brain.' itemprop='description'>

									<p>
											I study ants
											in the desert, in the tropical forest
											and in my kitchen,
											and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.
											I&#39;ve recently realized that ants
											are using interactions differently
											in different environments,
											and that got me thinking
that we could learn from this
											about other systems,
											like brains and data networks that we engineer,
											and even cancer.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what all these systems have in common
											is that there&#39;s no central control.
											An ant colony consists of sterile female workers —
											those are the ants you see walking around —
											and then one or more reproductive females
											who just lay the eggs.
											They don&#39;t give any instructions.
											Even though they&#39;re called queens,
											they don&#39;t tell anybody what to do.
											So in an ant colony, there&#39;s no one in charge,
											and all systems like this without central control
											are regulated using very simple interactions.
											Ants interact using smell.
											They smell with their antennae,
											and they interact with their antennae,
											so when one ant touches another with its antennae,
											it can tell, for example, if the other ant
											is a nestmate
											and what task that other ant has been doing.
											So here you see a lot of ants moving around
											and interacting in a lab arena
											that&#39;s connected by tubes to two other arenas.
											So when one ant meets another,
											it doesn&#39;t matter which ant it meets,
											and they&#39;re actually not transmitting
											any kind of complicated signal or message.
											All that matters to the ant is the rate
											at which it meets other ants.
											And all of these interactions, taken together,
											produce a network.
											So this is the network of the ants
											that you just saw moving around in the arena,
											and it&#39;s this constantly shifting network
											that produces the behavior of the colony,
											like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest,
											or how many are going out to forage.
											A brain actually works in the same way,
											but what&#39;s great about ants is
											that you can see the whole network as it happens.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											There are more than 12,000 species of ants,
											in every conceivable environment,
											and they&#39;re using interactions differently
											to meet different environmental challenges.
											So one important environmental challenge
											that every system has to deal with
											is operating costs, just what it takes
											to run the system.
											And another environmental challenge is resources,
											finding them and collecting them.
											In the desert, operating costs are high
											because water is scarce,
											and the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert
											have to spend water to get water.
											So an ant outside foraging,
											searching for seeds in the hot sun,
											just loses water into the air.
											But the colony gets its water
											by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds
											that they eat.
											So in this environment, interactions are used
											to activate foraging.
											An outgoing forager doesn&#39;t go out unless
											it gets enough interactions with returning foragers,
											and what you see are the returning foragers
											going into the tunnel, into the nest,
											and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.
											This makes sense for the ant colony,
											because the more food there is out there,
											the more quickly the foragers find it,
											the faster they come back,
											and the more foragers they send out.
											The system works to stay stopped,
											unless something positive happens.

											So interactions function to activate foragers.
											And we&#39;ve been studying
the evolution of this system.
											First of all, there&#39;s variation.
											It turns out that colonies are different.
											On dry days, some colonies forage less,
											so colonies are different in how
											they manage this trade-off
											between spending water to search for seeds
											and getting water back in the form of seeds.
											And we&#39;re trying to understand why
											some colonies forage less than others
											by thinking about ants as neurons,
											using models from neuroscience.
											So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation
											from other neurons to decide whether to fire,
											an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants
											to decide whether to forage.
											And what we&#39;re looking for is whether there might be
											small differences among colonies
											in how many interactions each ant needs
											before it&#39;s willing to go out and forage,
											because a colony like that would forage less.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And this raises an analogous question about brains.
											We talk about the brain,
											but of course every brain is slightly different,
											and maybe there are some individuals
											or some conditions
											in which the electrical properties of neurons are such
											that they require more stimulus to fire,
											and that would lead to differences in brain function.

									<p>
											So in order to ask evolutionary questions,
											we need to know about reproductive success.
											This is a map of the study site
											where I have been tracking this population
											of harvester ant colonies for 28 years,
											which is about as long as a colony lives.
											Each symbol is a colony,
											and the size of the symbol is
how many offspring it had,
											because we were able to use genetic variation
											to match up parent and offspring colonies,
											that is, to figure out which colonies
											were founded by a daughter queen
											produced by which parent colony.
											And this was amazing for me, after all these years,
											to find out, for example, that colony 154,
											whom I&#39;ve known well for many years,
											is a great-grandmother.
											Here&#39;s her daughter colony,
											here&#39;s her granddaughter colony,
											and these are her great-granddaughter colonies.
											And by doing this, I was able to learn
											that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies
											in their decisions about which days are so hot
											that they don&#39;t forage,
											and the offspring of parent colonies
											live so far from each other that the ants never meet,
											so the ants of the offspring colony
											can&#39;t be learning this from the parent colony.
											And so our next step is to look
											for the genetic variation
underlying this resemblance.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So then I was able to ask, okay, who&#39;s doing better?
											Over the time of the study,
											and especially in the past 10 years,
											there&#39;s been a very severe and deepening drought
											in the Southwestern U.S.,
											and it turns out that the
colonies that conserve water,
											that stay in when it&#39;s really hot outside,
											and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible,
											are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies.
											So all this time, I thought that colony 154
											was a loser, because on really dry days,
											there&#39;d be just this trickle of foraging,
											while the other colonies were out
											foraging, getting lots of food,
											but in fact, colony 154 is a huge success.
											She&#39;s a matriarch.
											She&#39;s one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site.
											To my knowledge, this is the first time
											that we&#39;ve been able to track
											the ongoing evolution of collective behavior
											in a natural population of animals
											and find out what&#39;s actually working best.

									<p>
											Now, the Internet uses an algorithm
											to regulate the flow of data
											that&#39;s very similar to the one
											that the harvester ants are using to regulate
											the flow of foragers.
											And guess what we call this analogy?
											The anternet is coming.
											(Applause)
											So data doesn&#39;t leave the source computer
											unless it gets a signal that there&#39;s enough bandwidth
											for it to travel on.
											In the early days of the Internet,
											when operating costs were really high
											and it was really important not to lose any data,
											then the system was set up for interactions
											to activate the flow of data.
											It&#39;s interesting that the ants are using an algorithm
											that&#39;s so similar to the one that we recently invented,
											but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms
											that we know about,
											and ants have had 130 million years
											to evolve a lot of good ones,
											and I think it&#39;s very likely
											that some of the other 12,000 species
											are going to have interesting algorithms
											for data networks
											that we haven&#39;t even thought of yet.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what happens when operating costs are low?
											Operating costs are low in the tropics,
											because it&#39;s very humid, and it&#39;s easy for the ants
											to be outside walking around.
											But the ants are so abundant
											and diverse in the tropics
											that there&#39;s a lot of competition.
											Whatever resource one species is using,
											another species is likely to be using that
											at the same time.
											So in this environment, interactions are used
											in the opposite way.
											The system keeps going
											unless something negative happens,
											and one species that I study makes circuits
											in the trees of foraging ants
											going from the nest to a food source and back,
											just round and round,
											unless something negative happens,
											like an interaction
											with ants of another species.
											So here&#39;s an example of ant security.
											In the middle, there&#39;s an ant
											plugging the nest entrance with its head
											in response to interactions with another species.
											Those are the little ones running around
											with their abdomens up in the air.
											But as soon as the threat is passed,
											the entrance is open again,
											and maybe there are situations
											in computer security
											where operating costs are low enough
											that we could just block access temporarily
											in response to an immediate threat,
											and then open it again,
											instead of trying to build
											a permanent firewall or fortress.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So another environmental challenge
											that all systems have to deal with
											is resources, finding and collecting them.
											And to do this, ants solve the problem
											of collective search,
											and this is a problem that&#39;s of great interest
											right now in robotics,
											because we&#39;ve understood that,
											rather than sending a single,
											sophisticated, expensive robot out
											to explore another planet
											or to search a burning building,
											that instead, it may be more effective
											to get a group of cheaper robots
											exchanging only minimal information,
											and that&#39;s the way that ants do it.
											So the invasive Argentine ant
											makes expandable search networks.
											They&#39;re good at dealing with the main problem
											of collective search,
											which is the trade-off between
											searching very thoroughly
											and covering a lot of ground.
											And what they do is,
											when there are many ants in a small space,
											then each one can search very thoroughly
											because there will be another ant nearby
											searching over there,
											but when there are a few ants
											in a large space,
											then they need to stretch out their paths
											to cover more ground.
											I think they use interactions to assess density,
											so when they&#39;re really crowded,
											they meet more often,
											and they search more thoroughly.
											Different ant species must use different algorithms,
											because they&#39;ve evolved to deal with
											different resources,
											and it could be really useful to know about this,
											and so we recently asked ants
											to solve the collective search problem
											in the extreme environment
											of microgravity
											in the International Space Station.
											When I first saw this picture, I thought,
											Oh no, they&#39;ve mounted the habitat vertically,
											but then I realized that, of course, it doesn&#39;t matter.
											So the idea here is that the ants
											are working so hard to hang on
											to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it
											that they&#39;re less likely to interact,
											and so the relationship between
											how crowded they are and how often they meet
											would be messed up.
											We&#39;re still analyzing the data.
											I don&#39;t have the results yet.
											But it would be interesting to know
											how other species solve this problem
											in different environments on Earth,
											and so we&#39;re setting up a program
											to encourage kids around the world
											to try this experiment with different species.
											It&#39;s very simple.
											It can be done with cheap materials.
											And that way, we could make a global map
											of ant collective search algorithms.
											And I think it&#39;s pretty likely that the invasive species,
											the ones that come into our buildings,
											are going to be really good at this,
											because they&#39;re in your kitchen
											because they&#39;re really good
at finding food and water.

											So the most familiar resource for ants
											is a picnic,
											and this is a clustered resource.
											When there&#39;s one piece of fruit,
											there&#39;s likely to be another piece of fruit nearby,
											and the ants that specialize on clustered resources
											use interactions for recruitment.
											So when one ant meets another,
											or when it meets a chemical deposited
											on the ground by another,
											then it changes direction to follow
											in the direction of the interaction,
											and that&#39;s how you get the trail of ants
											sharing your picnic.

									<p>
											Now this is a place where I think we might be able
											to learn something from ants about cancer.
											I mean, first, it&#39;s obvious that we could do a lot
											to prevent cancer
											by not allowing people to spread around
											or sell the toxins that promote
											the evolution of cancer in our bodies,
											but I don&#39;t think the ants can help us much with this
											because ants never poison their own colonies.
											But we might be able to learn something from ants
											about treating cancer.
											There are many different kinds of cancer.
											Each one originates in a particular part of the body,
											and then some kinds of cancer will spread
											or metastasize to particular other tissues
											where they must be getting
resources that they need.
											So if you think from the perspective
											of early metastatic cancer cells
											as they&#39;re out searching around
											for the resources that they need,
											if those resources are clustered,
											they&#39;re likely to use interactions for recruitment,
											and if we can figure out how
cancer cells are recruiting,
											then maybe we could set traps
											to catch them before they become established.

											Using only simple interactions,

											amazing feats for more than 130 million years.

understand how [harvester ant] foraging differences pay off in the long run, you’d need to study a group of harvesters for decades. That’s exactly what Gordon has done. Since she was a graduate student in 1985, she has almost single-handedly kept an annual census of around 300 harvester colonies in an area of New Mexico.","whotheyare":"By studying how ant colonies work without any one leader, Deborah Gordon has identified striking similarities in how ant colonies, brains, cells and computer networks regulate themselves.","whylisten":"<p>Ecologist Deborah M. Gordon has learned that ant colonies can work without central control by using simple interactions like how often the insects touch antennae. Contrary to the notion that colonies are organized by efficient ants, she has instead discovered that evolution has produced<span> </span>&ldquo;noisy&rdquo; systems that tolerate accident and respond flexibly to the environment. When conditions are tough, natural selection favors colonies that conserve resources. </p><p>Her studies of ant colonies have led her and her Stanford colleagues to the discovery of the &ldquo;Anternet,&rdquo; which regulates foraging in ants in the same way the internet regulates data traffic.
