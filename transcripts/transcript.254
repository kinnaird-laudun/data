											I was preaching in San Jose some time ago,

											to this conference,
											brought several CEOs
											and leaders
											of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley
											to have breakfast with me, or I with them.

											through technology
											and science.
											I know that we&#39;re near the end of this conference,

											But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia,

											I was to address a conference
											at a hotel.
											And on that elevator a man said,
											&quot;I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel.&quot;
											And another man looked in my direction and said,
											&quot;Yes, there he is. He&#39;s on this elevator with us.&quot;

											is not a — is an anticlimax,
											after all these tremendous
											talks that you&#39;ve heard,
											and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them.
											But I was
											on an airplane in the east some years ago,
											and the man sitting across the aisle from me
											was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.
											His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.
											And there was a drunk man on there,
											and he got up out of his seat two or three times,
											and he was making everybody upset
											by what he was trying to do.
											And he was slapping the stewardess
											and pinching her as she went by,
											and everybody was upset with him.
											And finally, John Belk said,
											&quot;Do you know who&#39;s sitting here?&quot;
											And the man said, &quot;No, who?&quot;
											He said, &quot;It&#39;s Billy Graham,
											the preacher.&quot;
											He said, &quot;You don&#39;t say!&quot;
											And he turned to me, and he said, &quot;Put her there!&quot;
											He said, &quot;Your sermons have certainly helped me.&quot;

											But this is not the first time
											that we&#39;ve had a technological revolution.
											We&#39;ve had others.
											And there&#39;s one that I want to talk about.
											In one generation,
											the nation of the people of Israel
											had a tremendous and dramatic change
											that made them a great power in the Near East.
											A man by the name of David
											came to the throne,
											and King David became one of the great leaders
											of his generation.
											He was a man of tremendous leadership.
											He had the favor of God with him.
											He was a brilliant poet,
											philosopher, writer, soldier —
											with strategies in battle and conflict
											that people study even today.

											But about two centuries before David,
											the Hittites
											had discovered the secret
											of smelting and processing of iron,
											and, slowly, that skill spread.
											But they wouldn&#39;t allow the Israelis
											to look into it, or to have any.
											But David changed all of that,
											and he introduced the Iron Age
											to Israel.
											And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,
											and which archaeologists have found,
											that in present-day Palestine,
											there are evidences of that generation.
											Now, instead of crude tools
											made of sticks and stones,
											Israel now had iron plows,
											and sickles, and hoes
											and military weapons.
											And in the course of one generation,
											Israel was completely changed.
											The introduction of iron, in some ways,
											had an impact
											a little bit like the microchip
											has had on our generation.
											And
											David found
											that there were many problems that technology could not solve.

											There were many problems still left.
											And they&#39;re still with us, and you haven&#39;t solved them,
											and I haven&#39;t heard anybody here speak to that.
											How do we solve these three problems
											that I&#39;d like to mention?
											The first one that David saw
											was human evil.
											Where does it come from?
											How do we solve it?
											Over again and again
											in the Psalms,
											which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,
											David describes the evils of the human race.
											And yet he says,
											&quot;He restores my soul.&quot;
											Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?
											On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe
											and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,
											as this conference vividly demonstrates.
											We&#39;ve seen under the sea,
											three miles down,
											or galaxies hundreds of billions of years
											out in the future.

											But on the other hand,
											something is wrong.
											Our battleships,
											our soldiers,
											are on a frontier now,
											almost ready to go to war
											with Iraq.
											Now, what causes this?
											Why do we have these wars in every generation,
											and in every part of the world?
											And revolutions?
											We can&#39;t get along with other people,
											even in our own families.
											We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip
											of self-destructive habits we can&#39;t break.
											Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world,
											bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.
											Even the most sophisticated among us
											seem powerless to break this cycle.
											I would like to see Oracle
											take up that,
											or
											some other
											technological geniuses work on this.
											How do we change man,
											so that he doesn&#39;t lie and cheat,

											The Bible says the problem is within us,
											within our hearts and our souls.
											Our problem is that we are separated
											from our Creator,
											which we call God,
											and we need to have our souls restored,
											something only God can do.
											Jesus said, &quot;For out of the heart
											come evil thoughts:
											murders, sexual immorality,

											slander.&quot;
											The British philosopher Bertrand Russell

											that it must be plucked out.&quot;

											He said, &quot;It&#39;s easier to denature plutonium
											than to denature the evil spirit of man.&quot;
											And many of you, I&#39;m sure,
											have thought about that

											The problem is not technology.

											The second problem
											that King David realized he could not solve
											was the problem of human suffering.
											Writing the oldest book in the world was Job,
											and he said,
											&quot;Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.&quot;
											Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back
											certain types of human suffering.
											But I&#39;m —
											in a few months, I&#39;ll be 80 years of age.
											I admit that I&#39;m very grateful
											for all the medical advances
											that have kept me in relatively good health
											all these years.
											My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me
											not to take this trip out here to this — to be here.
											I haven&#39;t given a talk in nearly four months.
											And when you speak as much as I do,
											three or four times a day,
											you get rusty.
											That&#39;s the reason I&#39;m using this podium
											and using these notes.
											Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere,
											I&#39;m ad-libbing.
											I&#39;m not reading. I never read an address.
											I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.
											I talk ad lib.
											But tonight, I&#39;ve

											But even here among us,
											most —
											in the most advanced society in the world,
											we have poverty.
											We have families that self-destruct,
											friends that betray us.
											Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us.
											I&#39;ve never met a person in the world
											that didn&#39;t have a problem
											or a worry.
											Why do we suffer? It&#39;s an age-old question
											that we haven&#39;t answered.
											Yet David again and again said
											that he would turn to God.
											He said, &quot;The Lord is my shepherd.&quot;
											The final problem that David knew he could not solve
											was death.
											Many commentators have said that death
											is the forbidden subject of our generation.
											Most people live as if
											they&#39;re never going to die.
											Technology projects the myth
											of control over our mortality.
											We see people on our screens.

											And yet, a few years earlier,
											death never crossed their mind.
											I talked to a woman this past week
											whose father
											was a famous doctor.
											She said he never thought of God, never talked about God,
											didn&#39;t believe in God. He was an atheist.
											But she said,
											as he came to die,
											he sat up on the side of the bed one day,
											and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.
											And he said, for the first time in his life

											Was there a God?
											A few years ago, a university student asked me,

											It passes so fast.&quot;
											But it does not need to have to be that way.
											Wernher von Braun,

											On the contrary, they&#39;re sisters.&quot;
											He put it on a personal basis.

											Blaise Pascal
											asked exactly that question
											in seventeenth-century France.
											Pascal has been called the architect
											of modern civilization.
											He was a brilliant scientist
											at the frontiers of mathematics,
											even as a teenager.
											He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory,
											and a creator of the first model of a computer.
											And of course, you are all familiar with
											the computer language named for him.
											Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas
											of evil, suffering and death.
											He was astounded
											at the phenomenon we&#39;ve been considering:
											that people can achieve extraordinary heights
											in science, the arts and human enterprise,
											yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy
											and have — and self-hatreds.
											Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture
											of genius and self-delusion.
											On November 23,
											1654,
											Pascal had a profound religious experience.
											He wrote in his journal these words:
											&quot;I submit myself,
											absolutely,
											to Jesus Christ, my redeemer.&quot;

											A French historian said,
											two centuries later,
											&quot;Seldom has so mighty an intellect
											submitted with such humility
											to the authority of Jesus Christ.&quot;
											Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God
											could bring us back into harmony,
											but he believed
											that his own sins and failures could be forgiven,
											and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.
											He experienced it in a way that went beyond
											scientific observation and reason.
											It was he who penned the well-known words,
											&quot;The heart has its reasons,
											which reason knows not of.&quot;

											Equally well known is Pascal&#39;s Wager.
											Essentially, he said this: &quot;if you bet on God,
											and open yourself to his love,
											you lose nothing, even if you&#39;re wrong.
											But if instead you bet that there is no God,
											then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come.&quot;
											For Pascal, scientific knowledge
											paled beside the knowledge of God.
											The knowledge of God was far beyond
											anything that ever crossed his mind.
											He was ready to face him
											when he died at the age of 39.
											King David lived to be 70,
											a long time in his era.
											Yet he too had to face death,
											and he wrote these words:
											&quot;even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
											I will fear no evil,
											for you are with me.&quot;
