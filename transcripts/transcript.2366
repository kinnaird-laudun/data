<title>David R. Williams: How racism makes us sick | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why does race matter so profoundly for health? David R. Williams developed a scale to measure the impact of discrimination on well-being, going beyond traditional measures like income and education to reveal how factors like implicit bias, residential segregation and negative stereotypes create and sustain inequality. In this eye-opening talk, Williams presents evidence for how racism is producing a rigged system -- and offers hopeful examples of programs across the US that are working to dismantle discrimination." />

<meta content='Why does race matter so profoundly for health? David R. Williams developed a scale to measure the impact of discrimination on well-being, going beyond traditional measures like income and education to reveal how factors like implicit bias, residential segregation and negative stereotypes create and sustain inequality. In this eye-opening talk, Williams presents evidence for how racism is producing a rigged system — and offers hopeful examples of programs across the US that are working to dismantle discrimination.' itemprop='description'>

											An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine
											told the story of Clyde Murphy,
											a black man who was a member
of the Class of 1970.
											Clyde was a success story.
											After Yale and a law degree from Columbia,
											Clyde spent the next 30 years
											as one of America&#39;s
top civil rights lawyers.
											He was also a great husband and father.
											But despite his success,
											personally and professionally,
											Clyde&#39;s story had a sad ending.

											In 2010,
											at the age of 62,
											Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung.
											Clyde&#39;s experience was not unique.
											Many of his black classmates from Yale
											also died young.
											In fact, the magazine article indicated
											that 41 years after graduation from Yale,
											the black members of the Class of 1970
											had a death rate
that was three times higher
											than that of the average class member.
											It&#39;s stunning.

											America has recently awakened
											to a steady drumbeat

being shot by the police.
											What is even a bigger story
											is that every seven minutes,
											a black person dies prematurely

of blacks and whites were equal.

											For the last 25 years,
											I have been on a mission
											to understand why does race
											matter so profoundly for health.
											When I started my career,
											many believed that it was simply
about racial differences
											in income and education.
											I discovered that while
economic status matters for health,
											there is more to the story.
											So for example, if we look
at life expectancy at age 25,
											at age 25 there&#39;s a five-year gap
between blacks and whites.
											And the gap by education
for both whites and blacks
											is even larger than the racial gap.
											At the same time,
at every level of education,
											whites live longer than blacks.
											So whites who are high school dropouts
											live 3.4 years longer
than their black counterparts,
											and the gap is even larger
											among college graduates.
											Most surprising of all,
											whites who have graduated from high school
											live longer than blacks
with a college degree
											or more education.

											In the early 1990s,
											I was asked to review a new book
											on the health of black America.
											I was struck that almost every single one
											of its 25 chapters
											said that racism
											was a factor that was hurting
the health of blacks.
											All of these researchers
											were stating that racism was a factor
adversely impacting blacks,
											but they provided no evidence.
											For me, that was not good enough.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											A few months later,
											I was speaking at a conference
in Washington, DC,
											and I said that one
of the priorities for research
											was to document the ways
in which racism affected health.
											A white gentleman stood in the audience
											and said that while he agreed
with me that racism was important,
											we could never measure racism.
											&quot;We measure self-esteem,&quot; I said.
											&quot;There&#39;s no reason
											why we can&#39;t measure racism
if we put our minds to it.&quot;

									<p>
											And so I put my mind to it
											and developed three scales.
											The first one captured
major experiences of discrimination,
											like being unfairly fired
or being unfairly stopped by the police.
											But discrimination also occurs
in more minor and subtle experiences,
											and so my second scale,
called the Everyday Discrimination Scale,
											captures nine items
											that captures experiences
											like you&#39;re treated
with less courtesy than others,
											you receive poorer service
than others in restaurants or stores,
											or people act as if they&#39;re afraid of you.
											This scale captures
											ways in which the dignity and the respect
											of people who society does not value
											is chipped away on a daily basis.

											Research has found
											that higher levels of discrimination
											are associated with an elevated risk
of a broad range of diseases
											from blood pressure to abdominal obesity
											to breast cancer to heart disease
											and even premature mortality.
											Strikingly, some of the effects
are observed at a very young age.
											For example, a study of black teens
											found that those who reported higher
levels of discrimination as teenagers

											Discrimination and racism
											also matters in other
profound ways for health.
											For example, there&#39;s
discrimination in medical care.
											In 1999, the National Academy of Medicine
											asked me to serve on a committee
											that found, concluded
based on the scientific evidence,
											that blacks and other minorities
											receive poorer quality care than whites.
											This was true for all kinds
of medical treatment,
											from the most simple
											to the most technologically sophisticated.
											One explanation for this pattern
											was a phenomenon
that&#39;s called &quot;implicit bias&quot;
											or &quot;unconscious discrimination.&quot;
											Research for decades
by social psychologists
											indicates that if you hold
a negative stereotype
											about a group in your subconscious mind
											and you meet someone from that group,
											you will discriminate against that person.
											You will treat them differently.
											It&#39;s an unconscious process.
It&#39;s an automatic process.
											It is a subtle process, but it&#39;s normal
											and it occurs even among
the most well-intentioned individuals.

											But the deeper that I delved
											into the health impact of racism,
											the more insidious the effects became.
											There is institutional discrimination,
											which refers to discrimination
											that exists in the processes
of social institutions.
											Residential segregation by race,
											which has led to blacks and whites living
in very different neighborhood contexts,
											is a classic example
of institutional racism.
											One of America&#39;s best-kept secrets
											is how residential segregation
											is the secret source
											that creates racial inequality
in the United States.
											In America, where you live
											determines your access to opportunities
											in education, in employment,
											in housing and even
in access to medical care.
											One study of the 171 largest
cities in the United States
											concluded that there is not even one city
											where whites live
under equal conditions to blacks,
											and that the worst urban contexts
in which whites reside
											is considerably better than the average
context of black communities.
											Another study found
											that if you could eliminate statistically
											residential segregation,
											you would completely erase
black-white differences in income,
											education and unemployment,
											and reduce black-white differences
in single motherhood
											by two thirds,
											all of that driven by segregation.
											I have also learned
											how the negative stereotypes
											and images of blacks in our culture
											literally create and sustain
											both institutional
and individual discrimination.

											A group of researchers
have put together a database
											that contains the books,
											magazines and articles
											that an average college-educated
American would read over their lifetime.
											It allows us to look within this database
											and see how Americans
have seen words paired together
											as they grow up in their society.
											So when the word &quot;black&quot;
appears in American culture,
											what co-occurs with it?
											&quot;Poor,&quot;
											&quot;violent,&quot;
											&quot;religious,&quot;
											&quot;lazy,&quot;
											&quot;cheerful,&quot;
											&quot;dangerous.&quot;
											When &quot;white&quot; occurs,
											the frequently co-occurring words
											are &quot;wealthy,&quot;
											&quot;progressive,&quot;
											&quot;conventional,&quot;
											&quot;stubborn,&quot;
											&quot;successful,&quot;
											&quot;educated.&quot;
											So when a police officer
											overreacts when he sees
an unarmed black male
											and perceives him
to be violent and dangerous,
											we are not necessarily dealing
with an inherently bad cop.
											We may be simply viewing
											a normal American
											who is reflecting
what he has been exposed to
											as a result of being raised
											in this society.

											From my own experience,
											I believe that your race
											does not have to be
a determinant of your destiny.
											I migrated to the United States
											from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia
											in the late 1970s
											in pursuit of higher education,
											and in the last 40 years,
											I have done well.
											I have had a supportive family,
											I have worked hard,
											I have done well.
											But it took more for me to be successful.
											I received a minority fellowship
from the University of Michigan.
											Yes. I am an affirmative action baby.
											Without affirmative action,
											I would not be here.

											But in the last 40 years,
											black America has been
less successful than I have.
											In 1978, black households
in the United States
											earned 59 cents for every dollar
of income whites earned.
											In 2015,
											black families still earn 59 cents
											for every dollar of income
that white families receive,
											and the racial gaps in wealth
are even more stunning.
											For every dollar of wealth
that whites have,
											black families have six pennies
and Latinos have seven pennies.

											The fact is,

											I am optimistic today
											because all across America,
											I have seen ripples of hope.
											The Boston Medical Center
											has added lawyers to the medical team
											so that physicians can improve
the health of their patients
											because the lawyers are addressing
the nonmedical needs their patients have.
											Loma Linda University
has built a gateway college
											in nearby San Bernardino
											so that in addition
to delivering medical care,
											they can provide job skills
											and job training
											to a predominantly minority,
low-income community members
											so that they will have the skills
they need to get a decent job.
											In Chapel Hill, North Carolina,
											the Abecedarian Project has figured out
											how to ensure that they have lowered
the risks for heart disease
											for blacks in their mid-30s
											by providing high-quality day care
											from birth to age five.
											In after-school centers
across the United States,
											Wintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy
											is breaking the cycle of incarceration
											by providing high-quality
academic enrichment and mentoring
											to the children of prisoners
											and children who have
fallen behind in school.
											In Huntsville, Alabama,
											Oakwood University,
											a historically black institution,
											is showing how we can improve
the health of black adults
											by including a health evaluation
											as a part of freshman orientation
											and giving those students
the tools they need
											to make healthy choices
											and providing them annually
a health transcript
											so they can monitor their progress.
											And in Atlanta, Georgia,
											Purpose Built Communities has dismantled
the negative effects of segregation
											by transforming a crime-ridden,
											drug-infested public housing project
											into an oasis of mixed-income housing,
											of academic performance,
											of great community wellness
											and of full employment.
											And finally,
											there is the Devine solution.
											Professor Patricia Devine
											of the University of Wisconsin
											has shown us how we can attack
											our hidden biases head on
											and effectively reduce them.
											Each one of us
											can be a ripple of hope.
