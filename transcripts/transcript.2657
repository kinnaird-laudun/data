<title>Sophie Andrews: The best way to help is often just to listen | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A 24-hour helpline in the UK known as Samaritans helped Sophie Andrews become a survivor of abuse rather than a victim. Now she&#39;s paying the favor back as the founder of The Silver Line, a helpline that supports lonely and isolated older people. In a powerful, personal talk, she shares why the simple act of listening (instead of giving advice) is often the best way to help someone in need." />

<meta content="A 24-hour helpline in the UK known as Samaritans helped Sophie Andrews become a survivor of abuse rather than a victim. Now she's paying the favor back as the founder of The Silver Line, a helpline that supports lonely and isolated older people.

											After cutting her arm with a broken glass,
											she fell into a fitful, exhausted sleep
on the railway station platform.
											Early in the morning,
when the station toilets were opened,
											she got painfully to her feet,
and made her way over to them.
											When she saw her reflection in the mirror,
											she started to cry.
											Her face was dirty and tearstained;
											her shirt was ripped and covered in blood.
											She looked as if she&#39;d been on the streets
for three months, not three days.
											She washed herself as best she could.
											Her arms and stomach were hurting badly.
											She tried to clean the wounds,
											but any pressure she applied
just started the bleeding again.
											She needed stitches, but there was no way
she would go to a hospital.
											They&#39;d have sent her back home again.
											Back to him.
											She tightened her jacket —
											well, fastened her jacket tightly
to cover the blood.
											She looked back at herself in the mirror.
											She looked a little better than before
but was past caring.
											There was only one thing
she could think of doing.
											She came out of the station
and into a phone box nearby.

											She didn&#39;t say much;
there were lots of silences.
											But she knew she was there,
											and having Pam on the end of the phone
felt so comforting.
											The 14-year-old
that made that call was me.
											That was me in the phone box.
											I was running away from home,
sleeping rough on the streets in London.
											I was being sexually abused
by my father and his friends.
											I was self-harming every day.
I was suicidal.
											The first time I called Samaritans,
I was 12 and absolutely desperate.
											It was a few months after
my mother had deserted me,
											walked out and left me in the family home.
											And the abuse I was suffering
at the hands of my father and his friends
											had left me a total wreck.
											I was running away, I was missing school,
											I was arriving drunk.
											I was without hope and wanted to die.
											And that&#39;s where Samaritans came in.

											Samaritans has been around since 1953.
											It&#39;s a 24/7 confidential
helpline in the UK
											for anyone who might be feeling
desperate or suicidal.
											Which I certainly was.
											Volunteers answer the phone
around the clock every day of the year,
											and calls are confidential.
											During my teenage years,
when I was most desperate,
											Samaritans became my lifeline.
											They promised me total confidentiality.
											And that allowed me to trust them.
											Disturbing as they no doubt
found my story, they never showed it.
											They were always there for me
and listened without judgment.
											Mostly, they gently
encouraged me to get help;
											I never felt out of control with them —
											an interesting parallel,
											as I felt so out of control
in every other aspect of my life.
											It felt my self-harm
was probably the only area
											where I felt I had any control.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											A few years later, I managed to get
some control in my life.
											And I had appropriate support around me
											to allow me to live
with what had happened.
											I had become a survivor of abuse
rather than a victim.
											And at 21, I contacted Samaritans again.
											This time because I wanted
to become a volunteer.
											Wanted to pay something back
											to the organization
that had really saved my life.
											I knew that the simple act of listening
in an empathetic way
											could have a profound effect.
											I knew that somebody
listening to me without judgment
											would make the biggest difference.

									<p>
											So I caught up with my education,
											found someone I could persuade
to give me a job,
											and I enjoyed my volunteering
at Samaritans.
											And when I say &quot;enjoyed,&quot;
it&#39;s an odd word to use,
											because no one would want
to think of anyone
											being in absolute distress or pain.
											But I knew that that profound impact
of that listening ear
											and someone being alongside me
at that desperate time
											had the biggest impact,
											and I felt a great sense of fulfillment
											that I was able to help people
as a Samaritan.

											In my years volunteering at Samaritans,
I was asked to perform many roles.
											But I guess the peak came in 2008,
											when I was asked to chair
the organization for three years.
											So I had actually gone
from that vulnerable caller
											in the phone box, desperate for help,
											to being the national lead
for the organization
											and responsible for 22,000 volunteers.
											I actually used to joke at the time
											and say if you really
screwed up as a caller,
											you might end up running the place.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Which I did.
											But I guess in a world which is dominated
by professionalizing everything we do,
											I really understood
that that simple act of listening
											could have such a life-changing effect.
											I guess it&#39;s a simple concept
											that can be applied
across all areas of life.

											So in the 1980s, when I called Samaritans,
											child abuse was a subject
no one wanted to talk about.
											Victims were often blamed,
victims were often judged.
											And it was a topic of shame,
and no one really wanted to talk about it.
											Today, judgment and shame
surround a different issue.
											There&#39;s a different stigma
that&#39;s out there.
											And the stigma that&#39;s there today
is to talk about loneliness.
											Loneliness and isolation
have profound health impacts.
											Being lonely can have a significant impact
on your own well-being.
											Recent systematic review of research
											actually said that it increased
the mortality rates,
											or premature death rates,
											by up to 30 percent.
											It can lead to higher blood pressure,
higher levels of depression,
											and actually aligned to mortality rates
											that might be more associated
with alcohol abuse or smoking cigarettes.
											Loneliness is actually more harmful
that smoking 15 cigarettes.
											A day.
											Not in your life, in your day.
											It&#39;s also associated
with higher levels of dementia.
											So a recent study also found
											that lonely people are twice at risk
of Alzheimer&#39;s disease.
											Of course, there&#39;s many people
that live alone who are not lonely.
											But being a caregiver for a partner
that maybe has dementia
											can be a very lonely place.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And a recent landmark study gave us
a very good, clear definition
											of what loneliness is.
											And it said it&#39;s a subjective,
unwelcome feeling
											of a lack or loss of companionship.
											And it happens when there&#39;s a mismatch
											between the quality and the quantity
of relationships that we have
											and those that we want.
											Now in my life, the best help
I&#39;ve ever received
											has been from those personal connections
											and being listened to
in an empathetic way.
											Professionals, and I&#39;m conscious
I&#39;m speaking to a room of professionals,
											have a very important place.
											But for me, a volunteer
giving up their time
											and listening to me without judgment
in a confidential way,
											had such a huge,
life-changing effect for me.
											And that was something
that really stayed with me.
											So as you will have gathered,
in my teenage years,
											I was off the rails, I was going every day
wondering if I&#39;d even live the next day.
											But that profound impact of the volunteer
listening to me stayed with me.
											When I finally got to a point in my life
											where I felt I could live
with what had happened,
											I wanted to pay something back.
											And in my experience,
											people who have been helped
in a transforming way
											always want to pay something back.
											So I started paying back by my 25 years
volunteering with Samaritans.

											And then, in 2013,
											picking up on that whole issue
and the new stigma of loneliness,
											I launched a new national
helpline in the UK for older people,
											called The Silver Line,
											which is there to support
lonely and isolated older people.
											In our short history,
we&#39;ve taken 1.5 million calls.
											And I know we&#39;re having a big impact,
based on the feedback we get every day.
											Some people might be calling up
for a friendly chat,
											maybe some information
about local services.
											Some might be calling
because they&#39;re suicidal.
											Some might be calling up
because they&#39;re reporting abuse.
											And some quite simply, as I was,
may have simply just given up on life.
											I guess it&#39;s a really simple idea,
setting up a helpline.
											And I look back to those early days
											when I had the lofty title, I still have,
of chief exec, but in the early days,
											I was chief exec of myself.
											Which, I have to say, I had
the best meetings ever in my career —

											We also have over 3,000 volunteers
making weekly friendship calls

											We also, for people
that like the written word,
											offer Silver Letters,
and we write pen-pal letters
											to older people who still enjoy
receiving a letter.
											And we also have introduced
something called Silver Circles —
											you notice I&#39;m owning
the word &quot;silver&quot; here —
											put &quot;silver&quot; in front of it and it&#39;s ours.
											Silver Circles are group conference calls

talk about shared interests.
											My favorite group is the music group,

play musical instruments

are now helping older people

											Quite often on the phone calls,
an older person would say,

											And one person quite simply

at every stage of my life,
											I have been lucky enough to have someone
