											I&#39;m extremely excited to be given the opportunity

											What I&#39;d like to do first is take you through
											a very brief helicopter ride of stunts
											and the stunts industry in the movies and in television,
											and show you how technology
											has started to interface with the physical skills
											of the stunt performer
											in a way that makes the stunts bigger

											I&#39;ve been a professional stunt man for 13 years.
											I&#39;m a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts
											I often design them.
											During that time, health and safety has become everything about my job.
											It&#39;s critical now that when a car crash happens
											it isn&#39;t just the stunt person we make safe, it&#39;s the crew.
											We can&#39;t be killing camera men. We can&#39;t be killing stunt men.
											We can&#39;t be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,
											or any passerby. So, safety is everything.
											But it wasn&#39;t always that way.

											In the old days of the silent movies —
											Harold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands —
											a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable.
											They had no safety, no real technology.
											What safety they had was very scant.
											This is the first stunt woman,
											Rosie Venger, an amazing woman.
											You can see from the slide, very very strong.
											She really paved the way
											at a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.

											My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.
											Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.
											He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see
											in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.
											This is a screen capture from &quot;Stagecoach,&quot;
											where Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I&#39;ve ever seen.
											There is no safety, no back support,
											no pads, no crash mats, no sand pits in the ground.
											That&#39;s one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly.

											Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,
											some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.
											We couldn&#39;t do them without technology.
											These are particularly dangerous
											because there is no mask on my face.
											They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper,
											one for FHM magazine.
											Highly dangerous, but also you&#39;ll notice
											it doesn&#39;t look as though I&#39;m wearing anything underneath the suit.
											The fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits,
											have been replaced with modern materials
											like Nomex or, more recently, Carbonex —
											fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals
											to burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.
											Here&#39;s a bit more.
											There&#39;s a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for.

											One of the things that a stuntman often does,
											and you&#39;ll see it every time in the big movies,
											is be blown through the air.
											Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that&#39;s all they had.
											And that&#39;s a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air,
											and hopefully you make it look good.

											Now we&#39;ve got technology. This thing is called an air ram.
											It&#39;s a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,
											because it will break your legs very, very quickly
											if you land on it wrong.
											Having said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.
											And that&#39;s in the up position. When you step on it,
											either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot,
											it will fire you, depending on the gas pressure,
											anything from five feet to 30 feet.
											I could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery.
											Which I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t want.
											Not today.

											Car stunts are another area
											where technology and engineering
											advances have made life easier for us, and safer.
											We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.
											Being run over is never easy.
											That&#39;s an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt.
											But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane —

											The next thing that I&#39;d like to show you is something that
											Dunlop asked me to do earlier this year
											with our Channel Five&#39;s &quot;Fifth Gear Show.&quot;
											A loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.

											Now, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be,
											&quot;Let&#39;s hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour.

											We went to Cambridge University, the other university,

											Even then, I caught seven G
											and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.
											That&#39;s a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right.

											High falls, they&#39;re old fashioned stunts.
											What&#39;s interesting about high falls
											is that although we use airbags,
											and some airbags are quite advanced,
											they&#39;re designed so you don&#39;t slip off the side like you used to,
											if you land a bit wrong. So, they&#39;re a much safer proposition.
											Just basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment.
											It&#39;s a bouncy castle
											with slats in the side to allow the air to escape.
											That&#39;s all it is, a bouncy castle.
											That&#39;s the only reason we do it. See, it&#39;s all fun, this job.
											What&#39;s interesting is we still use cardboard boxes.
											They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.
											And that&#39;s interesting because they are almost retrospective.

											In 1960, Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force
											did the most spectacular thing.
											He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise,
											and he did it to test high altitude systems
											for military pilots
											in the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so.

											There were three jumps.
											They first dropped some dummies.
											So that&#39;s the balloon, big gas balloon.
											It&#39;s that shape because the helium has to expand.
											My balloon will expand to 500 times
											and look like a big pumpkin when it&#39;s at the top.
											These are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet,
											and there is the camera that&#39;s strapped to them.
											You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude.
											And I&#39;m planning to go from 120,000 feet,

											I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.
											He&#39;s a very humble and wonderful human being.
											He sent me an email, saying, &quot;If you get this thing off the ground
											I wish you all the best.&quot; And he signed it, &quot;Happy landings,&quot;

											Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is
											when you get to 30,000 feet — it&#39;s great, isn&#39;t it? —
											When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen.

											It took me a while; it took me years to find the right balloon team
											to build the balloon that would do this job.
											I&#39;ve found that team in America now.
											And it&#39;s made of polyethylene, so it&#39;s very thin.
											We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps,

											And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled
											before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him.
											A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down.
											You can just see them there, popping open.

											You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet

											If you&#39;re at 100,000 feet you die.
											In six seconds you&#39;ve lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you&#39;re dead.
											Your blood tries to boil. It&#39;s called vaporization.
											The body swells up. It&#39;s awful.
											And so we expect — it&#39;s not much fun.
											We expect, and others expect,
											that perhaps the FAA, the CAA
											might say, &quot;You need to put someone in a suit
											that&#39;s not inflated, that&#39;s connected to the aircraft.&quot;
											Then they&#39;re comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.
