<title>Alejandro Aravena: My architectural philosophy? Bring the community into the process | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When asked to build housing for 100 families in Chile ten years ago, Alejandro Aravena looked to an unusual inspiration: the wisdom of favelas and slums. Rather than building a large building with small units, he built flexible half-homes that each family could expand on. It was a complex problem, but with a simple solution — one that he arrived at by working with the families themselves. With a chalkboard and beautiful images of his designs, Aravena walks us through three projects where clever rethinking led to beautiful design with great benefit." />

<meta content='My architectural philosophy? Bring the community into the process' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='When asked to build housing for 100 families in Chile ten years ago, Alejandro Aravena looked to an unusual inspiration: the wisdom of favelas and slums. Rather than building a large building with small units, he built flexible half-homes that each family could expand on. It was a complex problem, but with a simple solution — one that he arrived at by working with the families themselves. With a chalkboard and beautiful images of his designs, Aravena walks us through three projects where clever rethinking led to beautiful design with great benefit.' itemprop='description'>

											If there&#39;s any power in design,

											Let&#39;s start with the global challenge of urbanization.
											It&#39;s a fact that people are moving towards cities.
											and even if counterintuitive, it&#39;s good news.
											Evidence shows that people are better off in cities.
											But there&#39;s a problem that I would call
											the &quot;3S&quot; menace:
											The scale, speed, and scarcity of means
											with which we will have to
respond to this phenomenon
											has no precedence in history.
											For you to have an idea,
											out of the three billion 
people living in cities today,
											one billion are under the line of poverty.
											By 2030, out of the five billion people
											that will be living in cities,
											two billion are going to 
be under the line of poverty.
											That means that we will have to build
											a one million-person city per week
											with 10,000 dollars per family
											during the next 15 years.
											A one million-person city per week
											with 10,000 dollars per family.
											If we don&#39;t solve this equation,
											it is not that people 
will stop coming to cities.
											They will come anyhow,
											but they will live in slums, favelas
											and informal settlements.

									<p>
											So what to do? Well, an answer may come
											from favelas and slums themselves.
											A clue could be in this 
question we were asked
											10 years ago.
											We were asked to accommodate 100 families
											that had been occupying illegally
											half a hectare in the center
											of the city of Iquique 
in the north of Chile
											using a $10,000 subsidy
											with which we had to buy the land,
											provide the infrastructure,
											and build the houses that, 
in the best of the cases,
											would be of around 40 square meters.
											And by the way, they said,
											the cost of the land,
											because it&#39;s in the center of the city,
											is three times more
											than what social housing can normally afford.
											Due to the difficulty of the question,
											we decided to include the families
											in the process of understanding the constraints,
											and we started a participatory design process,
											and testing what was 
available there in the market.
											Detached houses,
											30 families could be accommodated.
											Row houses, 60 families.
											[&quot;100 families&quot;]
The only way to accommodate all of them
											was by building in height,
											and they threatened us
											to go on a hunger strike
											if we even dared to offer this
											as a solution,
											because they could not 
make the tiny apartments
											expand.
											So the conclusion with the families —
											and this is important, 
not our conclusion —
											with the families, was that we had a problem.
											We had to innovate.

									<p>
											So what did we do?
											Well, a middle-class family
											lives reasonably well
											in around 80 square meters,
											but when there&#39;s no money,
											what the market does
											is to reduce the size of the house
											to 40 square meters.
											What we said was,
											what if,
											instead of thinking of 40 square meters
											as a small house,
											why don&#39;t we consider it
											half of a good one?
											When you rephrase the problem
											as half of a good house
											instead of a small one,
											the key question is, which half do we do?
											And we thought we had 
to do with public money
											the half that families won&#39;t 
be able to do individually.
											We identified five design conditions
											that belonged to the hard half of a house,
											and we went back to the 
families to do two things:
											join forces and split tasks.
											Our design was something in between
											a building and a house.
											As a building, it could pay
											for expensive, well-located land,
											and as a house, it could expand.
											If, in the process of not being expelled
											to the periphery while getting a house,
											families kept their 
network and their jobs,
											we knew that the expansion 
would begin right away.
											So we went from this initial social housing
											to a middle-class unit achieved
by families themselves
											within a couple of weeks.

											So the purpose of design,
											trying to understand and 
trying to give an answer
											to the &quot;3S&quot; menace,
											scale, speed, and scarcity,
											is to channel people&#39;s own building capacity.
											We won&#39;t solve the one million
people per week equation
											unless we use people&#39;s own power for building.
											So, with the right design,
											slums and favelas may not be the problem
											but actually the only possible solution.
											The second case is how design can contribute
											to sustainability.
											In 2012, we entered the competition
											for the Angelini Innovation Center,
											and the aim was to build
											the right environment for knowledge creation.
											It is accepted that for such an aim,
											knowledge creation,
											interaction among people, 
face-to-face contact,
											it&#39;s important, and we agreed on that.
											But for us, the question 
of the right environment
											was a very literal question.
											We wanted to have a working space
											with the right light, with the right temperature,
											with the right air.
											So we asked ourselves:
											Does the typical office building
											help us in that sense?
											Well, how does that 
building look, typically?
											It&#39;s a collection of floors,
											one on top of each other,
											with a core in the center
											with elevators, stairs, 
pipes, wires, everything,
											and then a glass skin on the outside
											that, due to direct sun radiation,
											creates a huge greenhouse effect inside.
											In addition to that, let&#39;s say a guy
											working on the seventh floor
											goes every single day 
through the third floor,
											but has no idea what the guy on that floor
											is working on.
											So we thought, well, maybe 
we have to turn this scheme
											inside out.
											And what we did was,
											let&#39;s have an open atrium,
											a hollowed core,
											the same collection of floors,
											but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter,
											so that when the sun hits,
											it&#39;s not impacting directly glass, but a wall.
											When you have an open atrium inside,
											you are able to see what others are doing
											from within the building, and you have
											a better way to control light,
											and when you place the mass and the walls
											in the perimeter,
											then you are preventing direct sun radiation.
											You may also open those windows
											and get cross-ventilation.
											We just made those openings
											of such a scale that they could work
											as elevated squares,
											outdoor spaces throughout
											the entire height of the building.
											None of this is rocket science.
											You don&#39;t require sophisticated programming.
											It&#39;s not about technology.
											This is just archaic, 
primitive common sense,
											and by using common sense,
											we went from 120 kilowatts
											per square meter per year,
											which is the typical energy consumption
											for cooling a glass tower,
											to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.
											So with the right design,
											sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use
											of common sense.
											Last case I would like 
to share is how design
											can provide more comprehensive answers
											against natural disasters.
											You may know that Chile, in 2010,
											was hit by an 8.8 Richter scale
											earthquake and tsunami,
											and we were called to work
											in the reconstruction of the Constitución,
											in the southern part of the country.
											We were given 100 days, three months,
											to design almost everything,
											from public buildings to public space,
											street grid, transportation, housing,
											and mainly how to protect the city
											against future tsunamis.
											This was new in Chilean urban design,
											and there were in the 
air a couple of alternatives.
											First one:
											Forbid installation on ground zero.
											Thirty million dollars spent mainly
											in land expropriation.
											This is exactly what&#39;s being
discussed in Japan nowadays,
											and if you have a disciplined population
											like the Japanese, this may work,
											but we know that in Chile,
											this land is going to be 
occupied illegally anyhow,
											so this alternative was 
unrealistic and undesirable.
											Second alternative: build a big wall,
											heavy infrastructure to resist
											the energy of the waves.
											This alternative was conveniently lobbied
											by big building companies,
											because it meant 42 million 
dollars in contracts,
											and was also politically preferred,
											because it required no land expropriation.
											But Japan proved that trying to resist
											the force of nature is useless.
											So this alternative was irresponsible.
											As in the housing process,
											we had to include the community
											in the way of finding a solution for this,
											and we started a participatory design process.

											So it was pretty obvious after this process
											that, well, we chicken out here
											and go away because it&#39;s too tense,
											or we go even further in asking,
											what else is bothering you?
											What other problems do you have
											and you want us to take 
care of now that the city
											will have to be rethought from scratch?
											And what they said was,
											look, fine to protect the city 
against future tsunamis,
											we really appreciate, but the next one 
is going to come in, what, 20 years?
											But every single year, we have problems
											of flooding due to rain.
											In addition, we are in the middle
											of the forest region of the country,
											and our public space sucks.
											It&#39;s poor and it&#39;s scarce.
											And the origin of the city, our identity,
											is not really connected to the buildings that fell,
											it is connected to the river,
											but the river cannot be accessed publicly,
											because its shores are privately owned.
											So we thought that we had
to produce a third alternative,
											and our approach was 
against geographical threats,
											have geographical answers.
											What if, in between the city
											and the sea
											we have a forest,
											a forest that doesn&#39;t try to resist
											the energy of nature,
											but dissipates it by introducing friction?
											A forest that may be able to laminate the water
											and prevent the flooding?
											That may pay the historical debt of public space,
											and that may provide, finally,
											democratic access to the river.
											So as a conclusion of the participatory design,
											the alternative was validated politically and socially,
											but there was still the problem of the cost:
											48 million dollars.
											So what we did was a survey
											in the public investment system,
											and found out that there 
were three ministries
											with three projects in 
the exact same place,
											not knowing of the existence 
of the other projects.
											The sum of them: 52 million dollars.
											So design&#39;s power of synthesis
											is trying to make a more efficient use
											of the scarcest resource in cities,
											which is not money but coordination.
											By doing so, we were able to save
											four million dollars, and 
that is why the forest
											is today under construction.

											So be it the force of self construction,
											the force of common sense,
											or the force of nature, all these forces
											need to be translated into form,
											and what that form is modeling and shaping
											is not cement, bricks, or wood.
											It is life itself.
											Design&#39;s power of synthesis
											is just an attempt to put
											at the innermost core of architecture
											the force of life.
