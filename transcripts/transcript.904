											I want to share with you
											over the next 18 minutes
											a pretty incredible idea.
											Actually, it&#39;s a really big idea.
											But to get us started,
											I want to ask if everyone
											could just close your eyes for two seconds
											and try and think of a technology or a bit of science
											that you think has changed the world.
											Now I bet, in this audience,
											you&#39;re thinking of some really incredible technology,
											some stuff that I haven&#39;t even heard of,
											I&#39;m absolutely sure.
											But I&#39;m also sure, pretty sure,
											that absolutely nobody is thinking of this.
											This is a polio vaccine.

											And it&#39;s a great thing actually
											that nobody&#39;s had to think about it here today
											because it means that we can take this for granted.
											This is a great technology.
											We can take it completely for granted.
											But it wasn&#39;t always that way.
											Even here in California,
											if we were to go back just a few years,
											it was a very different story.
											People were terrified of this disease.
											They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.
											And it was because of scenes like this.
											In this scene,
											people are living in an iron lung.
											These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before,
											and then two days later,
											they can no longer breathe,
											and this polio virus has paralyzed
											not only their arms and their legs,
											but also their breathing muscles.
											And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually,
											in this iron lung to breathe for them.

											This disease was terrifying.
											There was no cure,
											and there was no vaccine.
											The disease was so terrifying
											that the president of the United States
											launched an extraordinary national effort
											to find a way to stop it.
											Twenty years later, they succeeded
											and developed the polio vaccine.
											It was hailed as a scientific miracle
											in the late 1950s.
											Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease,
											and here in the United States
											it had an incredible impact.
											As you can see, the virus stopped,
											and it stopped very, very fast.

											We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.
											This is the picture.
											There&#39;s not very much left in the world.
											But the reason there&#39;s not very much left
											is because there&#39;s been an extraordinary public/private partnership
											working behind the scenes, almost unknown,
											I&#39;m sure to most of you here today.
											It&#39;s been working for 20 years

											But just last year,
											we had an incredible shock
											and realized that almost just isn&#39;t good enough
											with a virus like polio.
											And this is the reason:
											in two countries
											that hadn&#39;t had this disease for more than probably a decade,
											on opposite sides of the globe,
											there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.
											Hundreds of people were paralyzed.
											Hundreds of people died —
											children as well as adults.
											And in both cases,
											we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses,
											and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.
											They had come from thousands of miles away.
											And in one case, it originated on another continent.
											And not only that, but when they came into these countries,
											then they got on commercial jetliners probably

											So I want to tell you a little bit
											about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership,
											is trying to do.
											We&#39;re not trying to control polio.
											We&#39;re not trying to get it down to just a few cases,
											because this disease is like a root fire;
											it can explode again if you don&#39;t snuff it out completely.
											So what we&#39;re looking for
											is a permanent solution.
											We want a world in which every child, just like you guys,
											can take for granted
											a polio-free world.
											So we&#39;re looking for a permanent solution,
											and this is where we get lucky.
											This is one of the very few viruses in the world
											where there are big enough cracks in its armor
											that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.
											This virus can only survive in people.
											It can&#39;t live for a very long time in people.
											It doesn&#39;t survive in the environment hardly at all.
											And we&#39;ve got pretty good vaccines, as I&#39;ve just showed you.
											So we are trying
											to wipe out this virus completely.
											What the polio eradication program is trying to do
											is to kill the virus itself
											that causes polio
											everywhere on Earth.

											Now we don&#39;t have a great track record
											when it comes to doing something like this,
											to eradicating diseases.
											It&#39;s been tried six times in the last century,
											and it&#39;s been successful exactly once.
											And this is because disease eradication,
											it&#39;s still the venture capital of public health.
											The risks are massive,
											but the pay-off —
											economic, humanitarian, motivational —
											it&#39;s absolutely huge.
											One congressman here in the United States
											thinks that the entire investment
											that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication
											pays itself off every 26 days —
											in foregone treatment costs
											and vaccination costs.
											And if we can finish polio eradication,
											the poorest countries in the world
											are going to save over 50 billion dollars
											in the next 25 years alone.
											So those are the kind of stakes that we&#39;re after.

											But smallpox eradication was hard;
											it was very, very hard.
											And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher,
											and there&#39;s a few reasons for that.
											The first is that,
											when we started trying to eradicate polio
											about 20 years ago,
											more than twice as many countries were infected
											than had been when we started off with smallpox.
											And there were more than 10 times as many people
											living in these countries.
											So it was a massive effort.
											The second challenge we had was —
											in contrast to the smallpox vaccine,
											which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life —
											the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.
											It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics
											that we&#39;ve had to put this special vaccine monitor
											on every single vial
											so that it will change very quickly
											when it&#39;s exposed to too much heat,
											and we can tell that it&#39;s not a good vaccine to use on a child —
											it&#39;s not potent; it&#39;s not going to protect them.
											Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.

									<p>
											But the third challenge we have —
											and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge —
											is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy —
											every single person almost who was infected with smallpox
											had this telltale rash.
											So you could get around the disease;
											you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.
											With polio it&#39;s almost completely different.
											The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus
											show absolutely no sign of the disease.
											So you can&#39;t see the enemy most of the time,
											and as a result,
											we&#39;ve needed a very different approach to eradicate polio
											than what was done with smallpox.

											We&#39;ve had to create

											Now it took years to build up the infrastructure
											for polio eradication —
											more than 15 years, much longer than it should have —
											but once it was built, the results were striking.
											Within a couple of years,
											every country that started polio eradication
											rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses,

											And in each of those, it was only part of the country.
											And then, by 1999,
											one of the three polio viruses
											that we were trying to eradicate
											had been completely eradicated worldwide —
											proof of concept.
											And then today,
											there&#39;s been a 99 percent reduction —
											greater than 99 percent reduction —
											in the number of children
											who are being paralyzed by this awful disease.
											When we started, over 20 years ago,

											And at the same time,

											has been working to help with a lot of other areas.

											It&#39;s also tried to save children by doing other things —
											giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots,
											giving bed nets against malaria even
											during some of these campaigns.
											But the most exciting thing
											that the polio eradication program has been doing
											has been to force us,

											So things were looking very exciting,
											and then about five years ago,
											this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.
											The first problem we ran into
											was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus,
											we just couldn&#39;t seem to get the virus rooted out.
											And then to make the matters even worse,
											the virus started to spread out of these four places,
											especially northern India and northern Nigeria,
											into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe,
											causing horrific outbreaks
											in places that had not seen this disease for decades.
											And then,
											in one of the most important, tenacious
											and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world,
											we found that our vaccine was working
											half as well as it should have.
											In conditions like this,
											the vaccine just couldn&#39;t get the grip it needed to
											in the guts of these children
											and protect them the way that it needed to.

											in the world of public health
