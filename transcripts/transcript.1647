											CR: So we&#39;ll have a conversation about
											the Internet, and we&#39;ll have a conversation Google,
											and we&#39;ll have a conversation about search
											and privacy,
											and also about your philosophy
											and a sense of how you&#39;ve connected the dots
											and how this journey that began
											some time ago
											has such interesting prospects.
											Mainly we want to talk about the future.
											So my first question: Where is Google
											and where is it going?
											LP: Well, this is something we think about a lot,
											and our mission we defined a long time ago
											is to organize the world&#39;s information
											and make it universally accessible and useful.
											And people always say,
											is that really what you guys are still doing?
											And I always kind of think about that myself,
											and I&#39;m not quite sure.
											But actually, when I think about search,
											it&#39;s such a deep thing for all of us,
											to really understand what you want,
											to understand the world&#39;s information,
											and we&#39;re still very much in the early stages of that,
											which is totally crazy.
											We&#39;ve been at it for 15 years already,
											but it&#39;s not at all done.

											LP: Well, I guess,
											in thinking about where we&#39;re going —
											you know, why is it not done? —
											a lot of it is just computing&#39;s kind of a mess.
											You know, your computer
doesn&#39;t know where you are,
											it doesn&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing,
											it doesn&#39;t know what you know,
											and a lot we&#39;ve been trying to do recently
											is just make your devices work,
											make them understand your context.
											Google Now, you know, knows where you are,
											knows what you may need.
											So really having computing 
work and understand you
											and understand that information,
											we really haven&#39;t done that yet.
											It&#39;s still very, very clunky.

									<p>
											LP: Yeah, so Deep Mind is a company
											we just acquired recently.
											It&#39;s in the U.K.
											First, let me tell you the way we got there,
											which was looking at search
											and really understanding,
											trying to understand everything,
											and also make the computers not clunky
											and really understand you —
											like, voice was really important.
											So what&#39;s the state of the art 
on speech recognition?
											It&#39;s not very good.
											It doesn&#39;t really understand you.
											So we started doing machine learning research
											to improve that.
											That helped a lot.
											And we started just looking at things like YouTube.
											Can we understand YouTube?
											But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube
											and it discovered cats, just by itself.
											Now, that&#39;s an important concept.
											And we realized there&#39;s really something here.
											If we can learn what cats are,
											that must be really important.
											So I think Deep Mind,
											what&#39;s really amazing about Deep Mind
											is that it can actually —
											they&#39;re learning things in this unsupervised way.
											They started with video games,
											and really just, maybe I can show the video,
											just playing video games,
											and learning how to do that automatically.

											I checked out the books and

											Potato diseases.
											One of the websites told me
											that ants could be the problem.
											It said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants.
											Then after a few days the ants disappeared.
											I got excited about the Internet.
											I have this friend
											who really would like to expand his business.
											So I went with him to the cyber cafe
											and we checked out several sites.
											When I met him next, he was going to put a windmill
											at the local school.
											I felt proud because
											something that wasn&#39;t there before
											was suddenly there.
											I realized that not everybody
											can be able to access
											what I was able to access.
											I thought that I need to have an Internet
											that my grandmother can use.
											So I thought about a notice board.
											A simple wooden notice board.
											When I get information on my phone,
											I&#39;m able to post the information
											on the notice board.
											So it&#39;s basically like a computer.
											I use the Internet to help people.
											I think I am searching for
											a better life
											for me and my neighbors.
											So many people have access to information,
											but there&#39;s no follow-up to that.
											I think the follow-up to that is our knowledge.
											When people have the knowledge,
											they can find solutions
											without having to helped out.
											Information is powerful,

											I almost use the economic concept of additionality,
											which means that you&#39;re doing something
											that wouldn&#39;t happen unless 
you were actually doing it.
											And I think the more you can do things like that,

											the more I learn about technology,

											If you invent something,
											Tesla invented electric power that we use,

											That had to be done by other people.
											It took a long time.
											And I think if we can actually combine both things,
											where we have an innovation and invention focus,
											plus the ability to really — a company
											that can really commercialize things
											and get them to people
											in a way that&#39;s positive for the world

											You know, I&#39;m amazed with the Loon Project

											Companies are doing the same incremental thing

											So I think we aim to do kind of similar things.

											LP: You know, I think the most important thing —
											I looked at lots of companies
											and why I thought they don&#39;t succeed over time.
											We&#39;ve had a more rapid turnover of companies.
											And I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong?
											What did those companies all do wrong?
											And usually it&#39;s just that they missed the future.
											And so I think, for me,
											I just try to focus on that and say,
											what is that future really going to be
											and how do we create it,
											and how do we cause our organization,
											to really focus on that
											and drive that at a really high rate?
											And so that&#39;s been curiosity,
											it&#39;s been looking at things
											people might not think about,
											working on things that no one else is working on,
											because that&#39;s where the additionality really is,
											and be willing to do that,
											to take that risk.
											Look at Android.
											I felt guilty about working on Android
											when it was starting.
											It was a little startup we bought.
											It wasn&#39;t really what we were really working on.
											And I felt guilty about spending time on that.
											That was stupid.
											That was the future, right?
