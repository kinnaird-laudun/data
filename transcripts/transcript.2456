<title>Peter Calthorpe: 7 principles for building better cities | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: More than half of the world&#39;s population already lives in cities, and another 2.5 billion people are projected to move to urban areas by 2050. The way we build new cities will be at the heart of so much that matters, from climate change to economic vitality to our very well-being and sense of connectedness. Peter Calthorpe is already at work planning the cities of the future and advocating for community design that&#39;s focused on human interaction. He shares seven universal principles for solving sprawl and building smarter, more sustainable cities." />

<meta content="More than half of the world's population already lives in cities, and another 2.5 billion people are projected to move to urban areas by 2050. The way we build new cities will be at the heart of so much that matters, from climate change to economic vitality to our very well-being and sense of connectedness. Peter Calthorpe is already at work planning the cities of the future and advocating for community design that's focused on human interaction. He shares seven universal principles for solving sprawl and building smarter, more sustainable cities." itemprop='description'>

											So, let me add to the complexity
											of the situation we find ourselves in.
											At the same time that we&#39;re solving
for climate change,
											we&#39;re going to be building cities
for three billion people.
											That&#39;s a doubling
of the urban environment.
											If we don&#39;t get that right,
											I&#39;m not sure all the climate solutions
in the world will save mankind,
											because so much depends
on how we shape our cities:
											not just environmental impacts,
											but our social well-being,
											our economic vitality,
											our sense of community and connectedness.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Fundamentally, the way we shape cities
is a manifestation
											of the kind of humanity we bring to bear.
											And so getting it right is, I think,
											the order of the day.
											And to a certain degree, getting it right
can help us solve climate change,
											because in the end,
											it&#39;s our behavior that seems
to be driving the problem.
											The problem isn&#39;t free-floating,
											and it isn&#39;t just ExxonMobil
and oil companies.
											It&#39;s us; how we live.
											How we live.

											There&#39;s a villain in this story.
											It&#39;s called sprawl,
and I&#39;ll be upfront about that.
											But it&#39;s not just the kind of sprawl
you think of, or many people think of,
											as low-density development
											out at the periphery
of the metropolitan area.
											Actually, I think sprawl can happen
anywhere, at any density.
											The key attribute
is that it isolates people.
											It segregates people
into economic enclaves
											and land-use enclaves.
											It separates them from nature.
											It doesn&#39;t allow the cross-fertilization,
											the interaction,
											that make cities great places
											and that make society thrive.
											So the antidote to sprawl is really
what we all need to be thinking about,
											especially when we&#39;re taking on
this massive construction project.

											So let me take you through one exercise.
											We developed the model
for the state of California
											so they could get on
with reducing carbon emissions.
											We did a whole series of scenarios
for how the state could grow,
											and this is just one
overly simplified one.
											We mixed different development prototypes
											and said they&#39;re going to carry us
through the year 2050,
											10 million new crew
in our state of California.
											And one was sprawl.
											It&#39;s just more of the same:
shopping malls, subdivisions,
											office parks.
											The other one was dominated by,
not everybody moving to the city,
											but just compact development,
											what we used to think of
as streetcar suburbs,
											walkable neighborhoods,
											low-rise, but integrated,
mixed-used environments.
											And the results are astounding.
											They&#39;re astounding not just
for the scale of the difference
											of this one shift
in our city-making habit
											but also because each one represents
a special interest group,
											a special interest group
that used to advocate for their concerns
											one at a time.
											They did not see the, what I call,
&quot;co-benefits&quot; of urban form
											that allows them to join with others.

											So, land consumption:
											environmentalists are really
concerned about this,
											so are farmers;
											there&#39;s a whole range of people,
											and, of course, neighborhood groups
that want open space nearby.
											The sprawl version of California
											almost doubles the urban
physical footprint.

											Greenhouse gas: tremendous savings,

carbon emission comes from cars,

											Vehicle miles traveled:
that&#39;s what I was just talking about.
											Just reducing the average 10,000 miles
per household per year,
											from somewhere
in the mid-26,000 per household,
											has a huge impact
not just on air quality and carbon
											but also on the household pocketbook.
											It&#39;s very expensive to drive that much,
											and as we&#39;ve seen,
											the middle class is struggling to hold on.

											Household costs:
											2008 was a mark in time,
											not of just the financial
industry running amok.
											It was that we were trying to sell
too many of the wrong kind of housing:
											large lot, single family, distant,
											too expensive for the average
middle-class family to afford
											and, quite frankly, not a good fit
to their lifestyle anymore.
											But in order to move inventory,
											you can discount the financing
and get it sold.
											I think that&#39;s a lot of what happened.
											Reducing cost by 10,000 dollars —
											remember, in California
the median is 50,000 —
											this is a big element.
											That&#39;s just cars and utility costs.
											So the affordable housing advocates,
who often sit off in their silos
											separate from the environmentalists,
separate from the politicians,
											everybody fighting with everyone,
											now begin to see common cause,
											and I think the common cause
is what really brings about the change.

											Los Angeles, as a result of these efforts,

											As a matter of fact, since &#39;08,

of bonds for transit

											Here&#39;s another kind of sprawl:
											China, high-density sprawl,
what you think of as an oxymoron,
											but the same problems,
everything isolated in superblocks,
											and of course this amazing smog
that was just spoken to.
											Twelve percent of GDP
in China now is spent
											on the health impacts of that.
											The history, of course,
of Chinese cities is robust.
											It&#39;s like any other place.
											Community was all about small, local shops
											and local services and walking,
interacting with your neighbors.
											It may sound utopian, but it&#39;s not.
											It&#39;s actually what people really want.
											The new superblocks —
											these are blocks that would have
5,000 units in them,
											and they&#39;re gated as well,
because nobody knows anybody else.
											And of course, there isn&#39;t even
a sidewalk, no ground floor shops —
											a very sterile environment.
											I found this one case
here in one of the superblocks
											where people had illicitly set up
shops in their garages
											so that they could have that kind
of local service economy.
											The desire of people
to get it right is there.
											We just have to get the planners
on board and the politicians.

											All right. Some technical planning stuff.
											Chongqing is a city of 30 million people.
											It&#39;s almost as big as California.
											This is a small growth area.
											They wanted us to test
the alternative to sprawl
											in several cities across China.
											This is for four-and-a-half
million people.
											What the takeaway from this image is,
											every one of those circles
is a walking radius
											around a transit station —
											massive investment in metro and BRT,
											and a distribution that allows everybody
											to work within walking distance of that.

											The red area, this is a blow-up.
											All of a sudden, our principles
called for green space
											preserving the important
ecological features.
											And then those other streets in there

											So instead of bulldozing,
leveling the site

											this green edge was something
that really wasn&#39;t normative in China
											until these set of practices
											began experimentation there.
											The urban fabric, small blocks,
											maybe 500 families per block.
											They know each other.
											The street perimeter has shops
											so there&#39;s local destinations.
											And the streets themselves become smaller,

places.","whylisten":"<p>Peter Calthorpe&rsquo;s 30-year design practice is informed by the idea that successful places -- whether neighborhoods, towns, urban districts or metropolitan regions -- must be diverse in uses and users, must be scaled to the pedestrian and human interaction, and must be environmentally sustainable.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Calthorpe developed the concept of Transit Oriented Development (described in his book <a

Calthorpe Associates&#39; work in Europe, Asia and the Middle East has demonstrated that community design with a focus on sustainability and scale can be adapted throughout the globe.
