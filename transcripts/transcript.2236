<title>Helen Fisher: Technology hasn&#39;t changed love. Here&#39;s why | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In our tech-driven, interconnected world, we&#39;ve developed new ways and rules to court each other, but the fundamental principles of love have stayed the same, says anthropologist Helen Fisher. Our faster connections, she suggests, are actually leading to slower, more intimate relationships. At 12:20, couples therapist and relationship expert Esther Perel steps in to make an important point -- that while love itself stays the same, technology has affected the way we form and end relationships." />

<meta content="Technology hasn't changed love. Here's why" itemprop='name'>
<meta content="In our tech-driven, interconnected world, we've developed new ways and rules to court each other, but the fundamental principles of love have stayed the same, says anthropologist Helen Fisher. Our faster connections, she suggests, are actually leading to slower, more intimate relationships. At 12:20, couples therapist and relationship expert Esther Perel steps in to make an important point — that while love itself stays the same, technology has affected the way we form and end relationships." itemprop='description'>

											I was recently traveling
in the Highlands of New Guinea,
											and I was talking with a man
who had three wives.
											I asked him, &quot;How many wives
would you like to have?&quot;
											And there was this long pause,
											and I thought to myself,
											&quot;Is he going to say five?
											Is he going to say 10?
											Is he going to say 25?&quot;
											And he leaned towards me
											and he whispered, &quot;None.&quot;

											Eighty-six percent of human societies
permit a man to have several wives:
											polygyny.
											But in the vast majority
of these cultures,
											only about five or ten percent of men
actually do have several wives.
											Having several partners
can be a toothache.
											In fact, co-wives can
fight with each other,
											sometimes they can even poison
each other&#39;s children.
											And you&#39;ve got to have
a lot of cows, a lot of goats,
											a lot of money, a lot of land,
											in order to build a harem.

											We are a pair-bonding species.
											Ninety-seven percent of mammals
do not pair up to rear their young;
											human beings do.
											I&#39;m not suggesting that we&#39;re not —
											that we&#39;re necessarily
sexually faithful to our partners.
											I&#39;ve looked at adultery in 42 cultures,
											I understand, actually,
some of the genetics of it,
											and some of the brain circuitry of it.
											It&#39;s very common around the world,
											but we are built to love.

											How is technology changing love?
											I&#39;m going to say almost not at all.
											I study the brain.
											I and my colleagues have put
over 100 people into a brain scanner —
											people who had just
fallen happily in love,
											people who had just been rejected in love
											and people who are in love long-term.
											And it is possible
to remain &quot;in love&quot; long-term.
											And I&#39;ve long ago maintained
											that we&#39;ve evolved three distinctly
different brain systems
											for mating and reproduction:
											sex drive,
											feelings of intense romantic love
											and feelings of deep cosmic
attachment to a long-term partner.
											And together, these three brain systems —
											with many other parts of the brain —
											orchestrate our sexual,
our romantic and our family lives.

											way below the limbic system
where we feel our emotions,
											generate our emotions.
											They lie in the most primitive parts
of the brain, linked with energy,
											focus, craving, motivation,
wanting and drive.
											In this case,
											the drive to win life&#39;s greatest prize:
											a mating partner.
											They evolved over 4.4 million years ago
among our first ancestors,
											and they&#39;re not going to change
if you swipe left or right on Tinder.

											I study the biology of personality,

styles of thinking and behaving,
											linked with the dopamine, serotonin,
											testosterone and estrogen systems.
											So I created a questionnaire
directly from brain science
											to measure the degree to which
you express the traits —
											the constellation of traits —
											linked with each
of these four brain systems.
											I then put that questionnaire
on various dating sites
											in 40 countries.
											Fourteen million or more people
have now taken the questionnaire,
											and I&#39;ve been able to watch
who&#39;s naturally drawn to whom.

											And as it turns out,

of the dopamine system
											tend to be curious, creative,
spontaneous, energetic —
											I would imagine there&#39;s an awful lot
of people like that in this room —
											they&#39;re drawn to people like themselves.
											Curious, creative people
need people like themselves.
											People who are very expressive
of the serotonin system
											tend to be traditional, conventional,
they follow the rules,
											they respect authority,
											they tend to be religious — religiosity
is in the serotonin system —
											and traditional people
go for traditional people.
											In that way, similarity attracts.
											In the other two cases, opposites attract.
											People very expressive
of the testosterone system
											tend to be analytical,
logical, direct, decisive,
											and they go for their opposite:
											they go for somebody who&#39;s high estrogen,
											somebody who&#39;s got very good verbal skills
											and people skills,
											who&#39;s very intuitive

											But technology is producing
one modern trend

of paradox of choice.
											For millions of years,

and gathering groups.
											You didn&#39;t have the opportunity to choose
											between 1,000 people on a dating site.
											In fact, I&#39;ve been studying this recently,
											and I actually think there&#39;s some
sort of sweet spot in the brain;
											I don&#39;t know what it is, but apparently,
from reading a lot of the data,
											we can embrace about five
to nine alternatives, and after that,
											you get into what academics
call &quot;cognitive overload,&quot;

											So I&#39;ve come to think that due
to this cognitive overload,
											we&#39;re ushering in a new form of courtship
											that I call &quot;slow love.&quot;
											I arrived at this during
my work with Match.com.
											Every year for the last six years,
											we&#39;ve done a study called
&quot;Singles in America.&quot;
											We don&#39;t poll the Match population,
											we poll the American population.

											We&#39;ve got data now on over 30,000 people,
											and every single year,
											I see some of the same patterns.
											Every single year when I ask the question,
											over 50 percent of people
have had a one-night stand —
											not necessarily last year,
but in their lives —
											50 percent have had
a friends with benefits
											during the course of their lives,
											and over 50 percent have lived
with a person long-term
											before marrying.
											Americans think that this is reckless.
											I have doubted that for a long time;
											the patterns are too strong.
											There&#39;s got to be some
Darwinian explanation —
											Not that many people are crazy.

											And I stumbled, then, on a statistic
that really came home to me.
											It was a very interesting academic article
											in which I found that 67 percent
of singles in America today
											who are living long-term with somebody,
											have not yet married because
they are terrified of divorce.
											They&#39;re terrified of the social,
											legal, emotional,
											economic consequences of divorce.
											So I came to realize that I don&#39;t think
this is recklessness;
											I think it&#39;s caution.
											Today&#39;s singles want to know
every single thing about a partner
											before they wed.
											You learn a lot between the sheets,
											not only about how somebody makes love,
											but whether they&#39;re kind,
											whether they can listen
											and at my age,
											whether they&#39;ve got a sense of humor.

											So it began to occur to me:
											during this long extension
of the precommitment stage,
											if you can get rid of bad
relationships before you marry,
											maybe we&#39;re going to see
more happy marriages.
											So I did a study of 1,100
married people in America —
											not on Match.com, of course —
											and I asked them a lot of questions.
											But one of the questions was,

											In fact, the greatest change
in modern romance and family life

piling into the job market

											For millions of years,

in little hunting and gathering groups.
											Women commuted to work
to gather their fruits and vegetables.
											They came home with 60 to 80

											Then the environment changed
some 10,000 years ago,

became obliged, really,
											to marry the right person,
											from the right background,
											from the right religion
											and from the right kin
and social and political connections.
											Men&#39;s jobs became more important:

											Well, I&#39;ve got three points here, right?
											First of all, to your first one:
											there&#39;s no question that we&#39;ve changed,
that we now want a person to love,

we had to marry the right person

and right kin connection.

											The bottom line is, in hunting
