											I would be willing to bet
I&#39;m the dumbest guy in the room,
											because I couldn&#39;t get through school;
I struggled with school.
											But I knew at a very early age
that I loved money, I loved business
											and I loved this entrepreneurial thing.
											I was raised to be an entrepreneur.
											What I&#39;ve been really
passionate about ever since —
											and I&#39;ve never spoken
about this ever, until now —
											so this is the first time
anyone&#39;s heard it,
											except my wife, three days ago.
											She said, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;
											I told her that I think
we miss an opportunity
											to find these kids
who have the entrepreneurial traits,
											and to groom them or show them
											that being an entrepreneur
is actually a cool thing.
											It&#39;s not something
that is a bad thing and is vilified,
											which is what happens in a lot of society.

											Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,
											and we have passions, and we have visions,
											and somehow we get those things crushed.
											We get told that we need to study harder
											or be more focused or get a tutor.
											My parents got me a tutor in French,
and I still suck in French.
											Two years ago,
											I was the highest-rated lecturer
at MIT&#39;s Entrepreneurial Master&#39;s Program.
											It was a speaking event
in front of groups of entrepreneurs
											from around the world.
											When I was in grade two,
I won a citywide speaking competition,
											but nobody had ever said,
&quot;Hey, this kid&#39;s a good speaker.
											He can&#39;t focus, but he loves walking
around and getting people energized.&quot;
											No one said, &quot;Get him
a coach in speaking.&quot;
											They said, get me a tutor
in what I suck at.

											So as kids show these traits —
and we need to start looking for them —
											I think we should be raising kids
to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.
											Unfortunately, the school system
is grooming this world to say,
											&quot;Let&#39;s be a lawyer,&quot;
or, &quot;Let&#39;s be a doctor.&quot;
											We&#39;re missing that opportunity,
											because no one ever says,
&quot;Hey, be an entrepreneur.&quot;
											Entrepreneurs are people —
we have a lot of them in this room —
											who have ideas and passions
or see these needs in the world
											and decide to stand up and do it.
											And we put everything on the line
to make that stuff happen.
											We have the ability
to get the groups of people around us
											that want to build that dream with us.
											And I think if we could get kids
to embrace the idea at a young age,
											of being entrepreneurial,
											we could change everything
in the world that&#39;s a problem today.
											Every problem out there,
somebody has the idea for.
											And as a young kid,
nobody can say it can&#39;t happen,
											because you&#39;re too dumb to realize
that you couldn&#39;t figure it out.

											I think we have an obligation
as parents and a society
											to start teaching our kids to fish
instead of giving them the fish —
											the old parable: &quot;Give a man
a fish, you feed him for a day.
											Teach a man to fish,
you feed him for a lifetime.&quot;
											If we can teach our kids
to be entrepreneurial,
											the ones that show the traits to be,
											like we teach the ones who have
science gifts to go on in science,
											what if we saw the ones
with entrepreneurial traits
											and taught them to be entrepreneurs?
											We could have these kids
spreading businesses
											instead of waiting
for government handouts.

											What we do is teach our kids
the things they shouldn&#39;t do:
											don&#39;t hit; don&#39;t bite; don&#39;t swear.
											Right now we teach our kids
to go after really good jobs;
											the school system teaches them
to go after things like
											being a doctor and being a lawyer
and being an accountant and a dentist
											and a teacher and a pilot.

											My first business venture:
I was seven years old, in Winnipeg.
											I was in my bedroom
with one of those long extension cords,
											calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg
											to find out how much they&#39;d pay
me for coat hangers.
											And my mom came into the room and said,
											&quot;Where are you going to get the hangers
to sell to the dry cleaners?&quot;
											And I said, &quot;Let&#39;s go look
in the basement.&quot;
											We went down to the basement,
and I opened up this cupboard.
											There was about 1,000 hangers
that I&#39;d collected,
											because, when I told her
I was going out to play,
											I was going door to door
in the neighborhood
											to collect hangers to put in the basement,
											because I saw her
a few weeks before that —
											you could get paid, they used to pay
two cents per coat hanger.
											So I was like, well,
there&#39;s all kinds of hangers,
											so I&#39;ll just go get them.
											I knew she wouldn&#39;t want me to get them,
											so I just did it anyway.
											And I learned that you could
actually negotiate with people.
											This one guy offered me three cents
and I got him up to three and a half.
											I even knew at seven years old
											that I could get
a fractional percent of a cent,
											and people would pay it,
because it multiplied up.
											At seven years old I figured it out.
											I got three and a half cents
for 1,000 hangers.

											I sold license plate
protectors door to door.

											At nine years old, I walked
around in the city of Sudbury
											selling license-plate
protectors door to door.
											And I remember
this one customer so vividly —
											I also did some other stuff
with these clients, I sold newspapers,
											and he wouldn&#39;t buy
a newspaper from me, ever.
											But I was convinced I was going to get him
to buy a license-plate protector.
											And he&#39;s like, &quot;We don&#39;t need one.&quot;
											I said, &quot;But you&#39;ve got two cars.&quot;
											Remember, I&#39;m nine years old.
											I&#39;m like, &quot;You have two cars and they
don&#39;t have license-plate protectors.

that&#39;s all crumpled up.&quot;
											He said, &quot;That&#39;s my wife&#39;s car.&quot;
											I said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we test one on her car

											So I knew there were two cars
with two license plates on each.

I could at least get one.

											I did comic book arbitrage.

											Get kids to stand up

in front of their friends,

											Those are entrepreneurial traits
you want to be nurturing.
											Show kids what bad customers
or bad employees look like.
											Show them grumpy employees.
											When you see grumpy
customer service, point it out.
											Say, &quot;By the way,

											We have all these lessons in front of us,
											but we don&#39;t take those opportunities;
we teach kids to get a tutor.
											Imagine if you actually took
all the kids&#39; junk in the house right now,
											all the toys they outgrew two years ago
											and said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we sell
some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?&quot;
											And they actually sell it and learn
how to find scammers when offers come in.
											They can come into your account
or a sub account or whatever.
											But teach them how to fix
the price, guess the price,
											pull up the photos.
											Teach them how to do
that kind of stuff and make money.
											Then 50 percent
goes in their house account,
											50 percent in their toy account.

											Some of the entrepreneurial traits
you&#39;ve got to nurture in kids:

											Look for that kind of stuff.
											There&#39;s two traits I want you
to also look out for
