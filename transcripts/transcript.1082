											It&#39;s really, really great to be here.
											You have the power to change the world.
											I’m not saying that to be cliché,
											you really have the power
to change the world.
											Deep inside of you,
every single one of you
											has the most powerful device known to man.
											And that&#39;s an idea.

											But an idea is powerless
											if it stays inside of you.
											If you never pull that idea out
for others to contend with,
											it will die with you.
											Now, maybe some of you guys
have tried to convey your idea
											and it wasn&#39;t adopted, it was rejected,
											and some other mediocre
or average idea was adopted.
											And the only difference between those two
is in the way it was communicated.
											Because if you communicate an idea
in a way that resonates,
											change will happen,
and you can change the world.

											In my family, we collect
these vintage European posters.
											Every time we go to Maui,
we go to the dealer there,
											and he turns these great big posters.
											I love them. They all have one idea
											and one really clear visual
that conveys the idea.
											They are about the size of a mattress.
They&#39;re really big.
											They&#39;re not as thick as a mattress,
but they&#39;re big.
											And the guy will tell the story
as he turns the pages.
											And this one time
I was flanked by my two kids
											and he turns the page
and this poster is underneath,
											and right when I lean forward and say,
											&quot;Oh my God, I love this poster,&quot;
											both of my kids jumped back
and they are like,
											&quot;Oh my God, mom, it&#39;s you.&quot;
											And this is the poster.

											The thing I loved
about this poster was the irony.
											Here&#39;s this chick all fired up,
headed into battle —
											as the standard bearer —

little Suavitos baking spices,

									<p>
											So if you are to swap out
those little Suavitos baking spices
											with a presentation —
											Yeah, it&#39;s me, pretty fired up.
											I was fired up about presentations
											back when it wasn&#39;t cool
to be fired up about presentations.
											I really think they have the power
to change the world
											when you communicate
effectively through them.
											And changing the world is hard.
											It won&#39;t happen with just one person
with one single idea.
											That idea has got to spread,
or it won&#39;t be effective.
											So it has to come out of you
											and out into the open for people to see.
											And the way that ideas are conveyed
the most effectively is through story.

									<p>
											You know, for thousands of years,
											illiterate generations would pass on
their values and their culture
											from generation to generation,
											and they would stay intact.
											So there&#39;s something kind of magical
about a story structure
											that makes it so that when it&#39;s assembled,
											it can be ingested and then recalled
											by the person who&#39;s receiving it.

											So basically a story,
you get a physical reaction;
											your heart can race, your eyes can dilate,
											you could talk about,
&quot;Oh, I got a chill down my spine&quot;
											or, &quot;I could feel it
in the pit of my stomach.&quot;
											We actually physically react
when someone is telling us a story.
											So even though the stage is the same,
a story can be told,
											but once a presentation is told,
it completely flatlines.
											And I wanted to figure out why.

									<p>
											Why is it that we physically sit
with rapt attention during a story,
											but it just dies for a presentation.
											So I wanted to figure out, how do you
incorporate story into presentations.
											So we&#39;ve had thousands of presentations
back at the shop —
											hundreds of thousands
of presentations, actually,
											so I knew the context
of a really bad presentation.
											I decided to study cinema and literature,
											and really dig in
and figure out what was going on
											and why it was broken.

											So it was obvious to start with Aristotle,
											he had a three-act structure,
a beginning, a middle and an end.
											We studied poetics and rhetoric,
											and a lot of presentations don&#39;t even
have that in its most simple form.
											And then when I moved on
to studying hero archetypes,
											I thought, &quot;OK, the presenter is the hero,
											they&#39;re up on the stage,
they&#39;re the star of the show.&quot;
											It&#39;s easy to feel, as the presenter,
that you&#39;re the star of the show.
											I realized right away,
that that&#39;s really broken.
											Because I have an idea,
I can put it out there,
											but if you guys don&#39;t grab that idea
and hold it as dear,
											the idea goes nowhere
and the world is never changed.
											So in reality,
the presenter isn&#39;t the hero,
											the audience is the hero of our idea.

											So if you look at
Joseph Campbell&#39;s hero&#39;s journey,
											just in the front part, there were
some really interesting insights there.
											So there is this likable hero
in an ordinary world,
											and they get this call to adventure.
											So the world is
kind of brought out of balance.
											And at first they&#39;re resistant.
											They&#39;re like, &quot;I don&#39;t know
if I want to jump into this,&quot;
											and then a mentor comes along
											and helps them move
from their ordinary world
											into a special world.
											And that&#39;s the role of the presenter.
											It&#39;s to be the mentor.
You&#39;re not Luke Skywalker, you&#39;re Yoda.
											You&#39;re the one
that actually helps the audience
											move from one thing
and into your new special idea,
											and that&#39;s the power of a story.
											So in its most simple structure,
it&#39;s a three-part structure of a story.
											You have a likable hero who has a desire,
											they encounter a roadblock
											and ultimately they emerge, transform,
and that&#39;s the basic structure.

											But it wasn&#39;t until I came across
a Gustav Freytag&#39;s pyramid —
											he drew this shape in 1863.
											Now, he was a German dramatist ...
											he was a German dramatist
											and he believed
there is a five-act structure,
											which has an exposition, a rising action,
											a climax, a falling action
and a denouement,
											which is the unraveling
or the resolution of the story.
											I love this shape.
So we talk about shapes.
											A story has an arc —
well, an arc is a shape.
											We talk about classical music
having a shapeliness to it.
											So I thought, hey,
if presentations had a shape,

											At the beginning of any presentation,
you need to establish what is.
											You know, here&#39;s the status quo,
here&#39;s what&#39;s going on.
											And then you need
to compare that to what could be.
											You need to make that gap
as big as possible,
											because there is this commonplace
of the status quo,
											and you need to contrast that
with the loftiness of your idea.
											So it&#39;s like, you know,
here&#39;s the past, here&#39;s the present,
											but look at our future.
											Here&#39;s a problem,
but look at that problem removed.
											Here&#39;s a roadblock,
let&#39;s annihilate the roadblock.
											You need to really amplify that gap.
											This would be like
the inciting incident in a movie.
											That&#39;s when suddenly
the audience has to contend
											with what you just put out there:
											&quot;Wow, do I want to agree
with this and align with it or not?&quot;
											And in the rest of your presentation
should support that.

											So the middle goes back and forth,
											it traverses between
what is and what could be,
											what is and what could be.
											Because what you are trying to do
											is make the status quo

											and you&#39;re wanting to draw them

											Now, on your way to change the world,
people are going to resist.
											They&#39;re not going to be excited,
they may love the world the way it is.
											So you&#39;ll encounter resistance.
											That&#39;s why you
have to move back and forth.
											It&#39;s similar to sailing.
											When you&#39;re sailing against the wind
and there is wind resistance,
											you have to move your boat back and forth,
and back and forth.
											That&#39;s so you can capture the wind.
											You have to actually
capture the resistance
											coming against you when you&#39;re sailing.
											Now interesting,
if you capture the wind just right
											and you set your sail just right,
											your ship will actually
sail faster than the wind itself.
											It is a physics phenomenon.
											So by planting in there
											the way they&#39;re going to resist
between what is and what can be,
											is actually going to draw
them towards your idea

as a new bliss.

the world is going to look,

kind of interesting:

is when he made them laugh.

is when he made them clap.
											They are so involved physically,
											they are physically reacting
to what he is saying,
											which is actually fantastic,
											because then you know
you have the audience in your hand.
											So he kicks off what could be with,
											&quot;This is a day I&#39;ve been looking
forward to for two and a half years.&quot;
											So he is launching a product
											that he&#39;s known about already

more than the audience laughs or claps.
											So he is like, &quot;Isn&#39;t this awesome?
Isn&#39;t this beautiful?&quot;
											He is modeling for the audience
what he wants them to feel.
											So he is actually doing a job
of compelling them to feel a certain way.

											a revolutionary product comes along

of repetition.

											he was using the same words and phrases,
											so people could remember and recall them.

a lot of metaphors and visual words.
											This was a way to take
really complicated ideas
											and make them memorable

											So if we look at
the very first end of what is,
											at the very end of what is
was the very first time
											that people actually clapped
and roared really loud.
											So the end of what is
what he did is he said,
											&quot;America has given
the Negro people a bad check,
											a check which has come back
marked insufficient funds.&quot;
											Well, everyone knows what it&#39;s like
to not have money in your account.
											So he used the metaphor
people were very familiar with.
											But when they really charged up,
											the very first time
they really screamed was:
											&quot;So we have come to cash this check,
											a check that will give us upon demand
											the riches of freedom
and the security of justice.&quot;
											That&#39;s when they really clapped.
											It was when he compared

a little farther in the model,

back and forth, and back and forth.
											Now the audience was in a frenzy.
											They were all excited,
and so you can actually do this
											to keep them in a heightened
sense of excitement.
											So he says, &quot;I have a dream
											that one day this nation will rise up
and live out the meaning of its creed.
											&#39;We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal.&#39;&quot;
											So he uses the little orange text there
to remind them of the promise
											that the politicians had made to him
or that this country had made.
											Then he moves back and forth between
											&quot;I have a dream that one day,
I have a dream that one day,
											I have a dream that one day,&quot;
											and at the end,
it gets really interesting.
											Because he uses —
you can look at the four shades of green,

of songs and scriptures.

was &quot;My Country, &#39;Tis of Thee.&quot;
											Now, that&#39;s a familiar song
that was specifically very significant

chose to change the words to as an outcry,

											You know, we self-sabotage our own ideas,

and butt up against the roadblocks

to let the struggle transform us

and have a dream and make it real.
											And you know, if anyone —
if I can do this, anybody can do this.

											I was raised in an economically
and emotionally starved environment.
											First time I got to go to a camp
with my sister, I was abused.

											Yeah, that was tumultuous,
and when they weren&#39;t fighting
											they were helping sober up
some alcoholic that was living with us
											because they were both sober alcoholics.
											So my mom abandoned us
when I was sixteen years old.
											And I took on a role of caretaker
of my home and of my siblings.
											And I married. I met a man.
											Fell in love. I went to a year of college.
											I did what every single,
bright, young girl should do —
