											There&#39;s a poem written
											by a very famous English poet
											at the end of the 19th century.
											It was said to echo in Churchill&#39;s brain
											in the 1930s.
											And the poem goes:
											&quot;On the idle hill of summer,
											lazy with the flow of streams,
											hark I hear a distant drummer,
											drumming like a sound in dreams,
											far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,
											dear to friend and food to powder,
											soldiers marching,
											soon to die.&quot;
											Those who are interested in poetry,
											the poem is &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; written by A.E. Housman.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But what Housman understood,
											and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,
											was that the long, hot, silvan summers
											of stability of the 19th century
											were coming to a close,
											and that we were about to move
											into one of those terrifying periods of history
											when power changes.
											And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen,
											accompanied by turbulence,
											and all too often by blood.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And my message for you
											is that I believe we are condemned, if you like,
											to live at just one of those moments in history
											when the gimbals upon which
											the established order of power is beginning to change
											and the new look of the world,
											the new powers that exist in the world,
											are beginning to take form.
											And these are — and we see it very clearly today —
											nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times,
											and all too often very bloody times.
											By the way, it happens about once every century.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											You might argue that the last time it happened —
											and that&#39;s what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too —
											was that when power passed from the old nations,
											the old powers of Europe,
											across the Atlantic to the new emerging power
											of the United States of America —
											the beginning of the American century.
											And of course, into the vacuum
											where the too-old European powers used to be
											were played the two bloody catastrophes
											of the last century —
											the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.
											Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,
											and it&#39;s probably a more accurate way of describing them.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, ladies and gentlemen,
											we live at one of those times.
											But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.
											And the first of these, the first two of these,
											is about a shift in power.
											And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,
											which has never quite happened in the way it&#39;s happening now.
											But let&#39;s talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.
											And what is happening today
											is, in one sense, frightening
											because it&#39;s never happened before.
											We have seen lateral shifts of power —
											the power of Greece passed to Rome
											and the power shifts that occurred
											during the European civilizations —
											but we are seeing something slightly different.
											For power is not just moving laterally
											from nation to nation.
											It&#39;s also moving vertically.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What&#39;s happening today is that the power that was encased,
											held to accountability, held to the rule of law,
											within the institution of the nation state
											has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.
											The globalization of power —
											we talk about the globalization of markets,
											but actually it&#39;s the globalization of real power.
											And where, at the nation state level
											that power is held to accountability
											subject to the rule of law,
											on the international stage it is not.
											The international stage and the global stage where power now resides:
											the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,
											the power of the money changers —
											this vast money-go-round
											that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary
											for the trade it&#39;s supposed to be there to finance —
											the money changers, if you like,
											the financial speculators
											that have brought us all to our knees quite recently,
											the power of the multinational corporations
											now developing budgets
											often bigger than medium-sized countries.
											These live in a global space
											which is largely unregulated,
											not subject to the rule of law,
											and in which people may act free of constraint.

											Now that suits the powerful
											up to a moment.
											It&#39;s always suitable for those who have the most power
											to operate in spaces without constraint,
											but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,
											unregulated space —
											space not subject to the rule of law —
											becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted —
											international trade, the Internet, etc. —
											but also by the things you don&#39;t want —
											international criminality, international terrorism.
											The revelation of 9/11
											is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,
											nevertheless,
											those who inhabit that space can attack you
											even in your most iconic of cities
											one bright September morning.
											It&#39;s said that something like 60 percent
											of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11
											actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers
											which 9/11 destroyed.
											You see, our enemies also use this space —
											the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters —
											to be able to get around their poison,
											which is about destroying our systems and our ways.

											Sooner or later,
											sooner or later,
											the rule of history
											is that where power goes
											governance must follow.
											And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,
											that one of the phenomenon of our time

											then it follows that one of the challenges of our time
											is to bring governance to the global space.
											And I believe that the decades ahead of us now

											Now notice, I&#39;m not talking about government.
											I&#39;m not talking about setting up
											some global democratic institution.
											My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,
											is that this is unlikely to be done
											by spawning more U.N. institutions.
											If we didn&#39;t have the U.N., we&#39;d have to invent it.
											The world needs an international forum.
											It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.
											But when it comes to governance of the global space,
											my guess is this won&#39;t happen
											through the creation of more U.N. institutions.
											It will actually happen by the powerful coming together
											and making treaty-based systems,
											treaty-based agreements,
											to govern that global space.

											And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.
											The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization,
											entirely treaty-based,
											and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,
											to account if necessary.
											Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create
											a treaty-based organization.
											The G20:
											we know now that we have to put together an institution
											which is capable of bringing governance
											to that financial space for financial speculation.
											And that&#39;s what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.

											Now there&#39;s a problem there,
											and we&#39;ll come back to it in a minute,
											which is that if you bring the most powerful together
											to make the rules in treaty-based institutions,
											to fill that governance space,
											then what happens to the weak who are left out?

											more or less turbulently,
											then our success in doing that

											to the global space.
											And watch that beginning to happen.

											You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,
											has been civilizations gathered around seas —

											the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.
											Well it seems to me
											that we&#39;re now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,

											to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.
											Now that begins with economic power,

											My guess is, for what it&#39;s worth,
											is that the United States will remain
											the most powerful nation on earth
											for the next 10 years, 15,

											It&#39;s going to be quite grumpy
											as China begins to democratize her society
											after liberalizing her economy.

											Europe in the 19th century:
											a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning,
											used to describe it as the &quot;European concert of powers.&quot;
											There was a balance, a five-sided balance.
											Britain always played to the balance.
											If Paris got together with Berlin,
											Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.
											Now notice,
											in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,
											you have fixed alliances —
											NATO, the Warsaw Pact.
											A fixed polarity of power
											means fixed alliances.
											But a multiple polarity of power
											means shifting and changing alliances.
											And that&#39;s the world we&#39;re coming into,

											that our alliances are not fixed.
											Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said,
											&quot;Britain has a common interest,
											but no common allies.&quot;
											And we will see increasingly

											Let me make a prediction for you,

											I suspect we are now reaching the end

											People say to me, &quot;The Chinese, of course,

											Oh yes? Why not?
											How many Chinese troops

											What is the largest naval contingent
											tackling the issue of Somali pirates?
											The Chinese naval contingent.
											Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.
											They want to keep the sea lanes open.
											Increasingly, we are going to have to do business
											with people with whom we do not share values,

											And here&#39;s the third factor,
											which is totally different.
											Today in our modern world,
											because of the Internet,
											because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here,
											everything is connected to everything.
											We are now interdependent.
											We are now interlocked,

											Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.
											But now we are intimately locked together.
											You get swine flu in Mexico,
											it&#39;s a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport
											24 hours later.
											Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.
											There are fires in the steppes of Russia,

											We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.
											And what that means

											not working with others,
											is no longer a viable proposition.
											Because the actions of a nation state
											are neither confined to itself,
											nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself

											because the effects outside the nation state

											I was a young soldier
											in the last of the small empire wars of Britain.
											At that time, the defense of my country
											was about one thing and one thing only:
											how strong was our army, how strong was our air force,
											how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.
											That was when the enemy was outside the walls.
											Now the enemy is inside the walls.
											Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country,
											I have to speak to the Minister of Health
											because pandemic disease is a threat to my security,
											I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture
											because food security is a threat to my security,
											I have to speak to the Minister of Industry
											because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure

											as we see from cyber warfare —
											I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs
											because who has entered my country,
											who lives in that terraced house in that inner city
											has a direct effect on what happens in my country —
											as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.
											It&#39;s no longer the case that the security of a country

											If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen — and it is —
											that we are now locked together

											Suddenly and for the very first time,

											It used to be the case
											that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe;

											my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.

											When I was a diplomat

											Peace has come to Northern Ireland

											One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East
