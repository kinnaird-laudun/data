											The advances that have taken place in astronomy,
											cosmology and biology, in the last 10 years,
											are really extraordinary —
											to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works
											than many of you might imagine.
											But there was something else that I&#39;ve noticed
											as those changes were taking place, as people were starting to find out that
											hmm ... yeah, there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy.
											The science writers and editors — I shouldn&#39;t say science writers,
											I should say people who write about science —
											and editors would sit down over a couple of beers,
											after a hard day of work, and start talking about
											some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works.

											(Laughter) Yeah, we need the time!
											Stephen Petranek: At first, it all seemed a little fantastical to me, but after challenging a lot of these ideas,
											I began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September 11 happened,
											and I thought, ah, God,
											I can&#39;t go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end.
											Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this!
											And that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists,
											about maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to,
											who was a neuroscientist, said,
											&quot;You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up,&quot;
											and reminds me of Michael&#39;s talk yesterday
											and his mother saying you can&#39;t have a solution if you don&#39;t have a problem.
											So, we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow,
											and lo and behold, we found them.
											Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush
											press conference from a couple of weeks ago.
											Can we run that, Andrew?

											But terrorists aren&#39;t the only threat we face.
											There are really serious calamities staring us in the eye

											and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems
											I&#39;m going to talk to you about, the vast majority could be solved,

											In a few years, NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter,
											where there&#39;s less dust, and start looking for Earth-like planets,

											They said, we&#39;ve been looking at the oceans for a long time now,
											and we want to tell you they&#39;re not in trouble, they&#39;re near collapse.
											Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger.
											We&#39;re living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record
											by a factor of 10,000.
											We have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years.
											California is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years.
											Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree.
											You cut down that tree, the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.
											There&#39;s really a tree like that out there. That&#39;s really what it comes to.
											And when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it,
											like our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions?

											A lot of very sober-minded physicists, believe it or not,

											This spring — there&#39;s a collider at Brookhaven, on Long Island —
											this spring, it&#39;s going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes.

											Number six: biotech disaster.
											It&#39;s one of my favorite ones, because we&#39;ve done several stories on Bt corn.
											Bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer.
											You may of heard of it — heard it called StarLink,
											especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets
											about a year and a half ago.
											This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States,
											and it got into the human food supply, and somebody should&#39;ve figured out
											that it would get in the human food supply very easily.
											But the thing that&#39;s alarming is a couple of months ago, in Mexico,
											where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal,
											they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.
											Now, corn originated, we think, in Mexico.
											This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn.
											This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently,
											that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world,
											from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world&#39;s food supply
											in very short order.

											We think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the Milky Way alone, our galaxy.
											And these stars have compressed down to maybe something like 12, 15 miles wide,
											and they are black holes. And they are gobbling up everything around them,
											including light, which is why we can&#39;t see them.
											Most of them should be in orbit around something.
											But galaxies are very violent places, and things can be spun out of orbit.
											And also, space is incredibly vast.
											So even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit,
											the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote.
											But it only has to get close, about a billion miles away, one of these things.
											About a billion miles away, here&#39;s what happens to Earth&#39;s orbit:
											it becomes elliptical instead of circular.
											And for three months out of the year,
											the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180.
											For three months out of the year, they go to 50 below zero.
											That won&#39;t work too well. What can we do about this?
											And this is my scariest. (Laughter)
											I don&#39;t have a good answer for this one.
											Again, we gotta think about being a colonizing race.

											And finally, number one: biggest danger to life as we know it, I think,
											a really big asteroid heads for Earth.
											The important thing to remember here — this is not a question of if,
											this is a question of when, and how big.
											In 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet
											exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles.
											It had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs.
											Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years.
											In 1989, a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth.

											Nothing to worry about, right?
											It passed directly through Earth&#39;s orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier.
											A small asteroid, say a half mile wide, would touch off firestorms
											followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up —
											Carl Sagan&#39;s nuclear winter thing.
											An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions.
											We think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide.
											Where are they? There&#39;s something called the Kuiper belt,
											which — some people think Pluto&#39;s not a planet,
											that&#39;s where Pluto is, it&#39;s in the Kuiper belt.
											There&#39;s also something a little farther out, called the Oort cloud.
											There are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock — comets, really —
											out there, that are 50 miles in diameter or more,
											and they regularly take a little spin,
											in towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us.
											Of more concern, I think, is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter.
											The folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall —
											they&#39;re making the first map of the universe, three-dimensional map of the universe —
											that there are probably 700,000 asteroids between Mars and Jupiter
											that are a half a mile big or bigger.
											So you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening?
											Andrew, can you put that chart up?

											This is a chart that Dr. Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute
											presented to Congress a few years ago.
											You&#39;ll notice that the chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you
											is about one in 20,000, according to the work they&#39;ve done.
											Now look at the one right below that.
											Passenger aircraft crash, one in 20,000.
											We spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don&#39;t die in airplane accidents,
											and we&#39;re not spending hardly anything on this. And yet, this is completely preventable.
											We finally have, just in the last year, the technology to stop this cold.
											Could we have the solutions?

											NASA&#39;s spending three million dollars a year, three million bucks —
											that is like pocket change — to search for asteroids.
											Because we can actually figure out every asteroid that&#39;s out there,
											and if it might hit Earth, and when it might hit Earth.
											And they&#39;re trying to do that.
											But it&#39;s going to take them 10 years, at spending three million dollars a year,
											and even then, they claim they&#39;ll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued.
											Comets are a tougher act.
											We don&#39;t really have the technology to predict comet trajectories,
											or when one with our name on it might arrive.
											But we would have lots of time, if we see it coming.
											We really need a dedicated observatory.
											You&#39;ll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of,
											amateur astronomers? That&#39;s because nobody&#39;s looking for them, except amateurs.
											We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets.

											Part two of the solutions: we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid,
											or alter its trajectory. Now, a year ago, we did an amazing thing.
											We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt,
											called NEAR, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous.
											And these guys orbited a 30 — or no, about a 22-mile long asteroid called Eros.
											And then, of course, you know, they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things,
											where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything,
											and then, at the last minute, they landed.
											When the mission was over, they actually landed on the thing.
											We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It&#39;s not a big deal.
											Now, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing
											is that you don&#39;t have anything to push against in space, because there&#39;s no air.
											A nuclear explosion is just as hot,
											but we don&#39;t really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid,
											or vaporize it, would be more like it.

									<p>
											But we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them
											and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it,
											which would gently, slowly, after a period of time, push it into a different trajectory,
											which, if we&#39;ve done our math right, would keep it from hitting Earth.
											This is just a matter of finding &#39;em, going there, and doing something about it.
											I know your head is spinning from all this stuff.
											Yikes! So many big threats!

											The thing, I think, to remember, is September 11.
											We don&#39;t want to get caught flat-footed again.
											We know about this stuff.
											Science has the power to predict the future in many cases now.
											Knowledge is power.
											The worst thing we can do is say, jeez, I got enough to worry about
											without worrying about an asteroid. (Laughter)
											That&#39;s a mistake that could literally cost us our future.
											Thank you.
