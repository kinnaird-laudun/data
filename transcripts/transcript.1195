											All right. So, like all good stories,
											this starts a long, long time ago
											when there was basically nothing.
											So here is a complete picture of the universe
											about 14-odd billion years ago.
											All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.
											For some reason it explodes,
											and you begin to get these things.
											So you&#39;re now about 14 billion years into this.
											And these things expand and expand and expand
											into these giant galaxies,
											and you get trillions of them.
											And within these galaxies
											you get these enormous dust clouds.
											And I want you to pay particular attention
											to the three little prongs
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											in the center of this picture.
											If you take a close-up of those,
											they look like this.
											And what you&#39;re looking at is columns of dust
											where there&#39;s so much dust —
											by the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles —
											and what&#39;s happening is there&#39;s so much dust,
											it comes together and it fuses
											and ignites a thermonuclear reaction.
											And so what you&#39;re watching
											is the birth of stars.
											These are stars being born out of here.
											When enough stars come out,
											they create a galaxy.
											This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy,
											because you are here.
											(Laughter)
											And as you take a close-up of this galaxy,
											you find a relatively normal,
											not particularly interesting star.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											By the way, you&#39;re now about two-thirds of the way into this story.
											So this star doesn&#39;t even appear
											until about two-thirds of the way into this story.
											And then what happens
											is there&#39;s enough dust left over
											that it doesn&#39;t ignite into a star,
											it becomes a planet.
											And this is about a little over four billion years ago.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And soon thereafter
											there&#39;s enough material left over
											that you get a primordial soup,
											and that creates life.
											And life starts to expand and expand and expand,
											until it goes kaput.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the really strange thing
											is life goes kaput, not once, not twice,
											but five times.
											So almost all life on Earth
											is wiped out about five times.
											And as you&#39;re thinking about that,
											what happens is you get more and more complexity,
											more and more stuff
											to build new things with.
											And we don&#39;t appear
											until about 99.96 percent of the time into this story,
											just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective.
									</p>

									<p>
											So within that context, there&#39;s two theories of the case
											as to why we&#39;re all here.
											The first theory of the case
											is that&#39;s all she wrote.
											Under that theory,
											we are the be-all and end-all
											of all creation.
											And the reason for trillions of galaxies,

											So maybe you have to think about a second theory
											if the first one isn&#39;t good enough.
											Second theory is: Could we upgrade?
											(Laughter)
											Well, why would one ask a question like that?
											Because there have been at least 29 upgrades so far
											of humanoids.
											So it turns out that we have upgraded.
											We&#39;ve upgraded time and again and again.
											And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades.
											We found this one last year.
											We found another one last month.

											And as you&#39;re thinking about this,
											you might also ask the question:
											So why a single human species?
											Wouldn&#39;t it be really odd
											if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica
											and found exactly the same bird —
											particularly given that we co-existed at the same time
											with at least eight other versions of humanoid
											at the same time on this planet?
											So the normal state of affairs

									<p>
											And if that is the normal state of affairs,
											then you might ask yourself,
											all right, so if we want to create something else,
											how big does a mutation have to be?
											Well Svante Paabo has the answer.
											The difference between humans and Neanderthal
											is 0.004 percent of gene code.
											That&#39;s how big the difference is
											one species to another.
											This explains most contemporary political debates.

											But as you&#39;re thinking about this,
											one of the interesting things
											is how small these mutations are and where they take place.
											Difference human/Neanderthal
											is sperm and testis,
											smell and skin.
											And those are the specific genes
											that differ from one to the other.
											So very small changes can have a big impact.

											And as it continues,
											one of the things that&#39;s going to happen this year
											is we&#39;re going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes,

											And by the way, this is not a debate that we&#39;re ready for,
											because we have really misused the science in this.
											In the 1920s, we thought there were major differences between people.
											That was partly based on Francis Galton&#39;s work.
											He was Darwin&#39;s cousin.
											But the U.S., the Carnegie Institute,
											Stanford, American Neurological Association
											took this really far.
											That got exported and was really misused.
											In fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous
											treatment of human beings.
											So since the 1940s, we&#39;ve been saying there are no differences,
											we&#39;re all identical.
											We&#39;re going to know at year end if that is true.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And as we think about that,
											we&#39;re actually beginning to find things
											like, do you have an ACE gene?
											Why would that matter?
											Because nobody&#39;s ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen
											that doesn&#39;t have an ACE gene.
											And if you want to get more specific,
											how about a 577R genotype?
											Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested
											carries at least one of these variants.

											If that is true,
											it leads to some very complicated questions
											for the London Olympics.
											Three options:
											Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase
											for really hardworking mutants?
											(Laughter)
											Option number two:
											Why don&#39;t we play it like golf or sailing?
											Because you have one and you don&#39;t have one,
											I&#39;ll give you a tenth of a second head start.
											Version number three:
											Because this is a naturally occurring gene
											and you&#39;ve got it and you didn&#39;t pick the right parents,
											you get the right to upgrade.
											Three different options.
											If these differences are the difference

											And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States,

											You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED,

											then you don&#39;t hear a lot,
											until you hear about an experiment last year in China,
											where they take skin cells from this mouse,
											put four chemicals on it,
											turn those skin cells into stem cells,
											let the stem cells grow

									<p>
											That&#39;s a big deal.
											Because in essence
											what it means is you can take a cell,
											which is a pluripotent stem cell,
											which is like a skier at the top of a mountain,
											and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells,
											four, eight, 16,
											and then it gets so crowded
											after 16 divisions
											that those cells have to differentiate.
											So they go down one side of the mountain,
											they go down another.
											And as they pick that,
											these become bone,
											and then they pick another road and these become platelets,
											and these become macrophages,
											and these become T cells.
											But it&#39;s really hard, once you ski down,
											to get back up.
											Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.
											And what those four chemicals do
											is they take any cell
											and take it way back up the mountain
											so it can become any body part.

											And as you think of that,
											what it means is potentially
											you can rebuild a full copy

											out of any one of its cells.
											That turns out to be a big deal
											because now you can take, not just mouse cells,
											but you can human skin cells
											and turn them into human stem cells.
											And then what they did in October
											is they took skin cells, turned them into stem cells
											and began to turn them into liver cells.
											So in theory,
											you could grow any organ from any one of your cells.

											Here&#39;s a second experiment:
											If you could photocopy your body,
											maybe you also want to take your mind.
											And one of the things you saw at TED
											about a year and a half ago
											was this guy.
											And he gave a wonderful technical talk.
											He&#39;s a professor at MIT.
											But in essence what he said
											is you can take retroviruses,
											which get inside brain cells of mice.
											You can tag them with proteins
											that light up when you light them.
											And you can map the exact pathways
											when a mouse sees, feels, touches,
											remembers, loves.
											And then you can take a fiber optic cable
											and light up some of the same things.
											And by the way, as you do this,
											you can image it in two colors,

											Do we have any evidence that that is happening?
											Well let&#39;s take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand.
											Here&#39;s what it looks like in 2000.
											Here&#39;s what it looks like in 2002,
											2006, 2008.
											Here&#39;s the increase in less than a decade.
											And we still don&#39;t know why this is happening.
											What we do know is, potentially,
											the brain is reacting in
											a hyperactive, hyper-plastic way,
											and creating individuals that are like this.
											And this is only one of the conditions that&#39;s out there.
											You&#39;ve also got people with who are extraordinarily smart,
											people who can remember everything they&#39;ve seen in their lives,
											people who&#39;ve got synesthesia,

											But one question you might want to ask is,
											are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain

											Because when you think of how much data&#39;s coming into our brains,
											we&#39;re trying to take in as much data in a day
											as people used to take in in a lifetime.
											And as you&#39;re thinking about this,
											there&#39;s four theories as to why this might be going on,

											A second option is the sexy geek option.
											These conditions are highly rare.
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											But what&#39;s beginning to happen
											is because these geeks are all getting together,
											because they are highly qualified for computer programming
											and it is highly remunerated,
											as well as other very detail-oriented tasks,
											that they are concentrating geographically
											and finding like-minded mates.
											So this is the assortative mating hypothesis

											The third, is this too much information?
											We&#39;re trying to process so much stuff
											that some people get synesthetic
											and just have huge pipes that remember everything.

											I think we&#39;re transitioning into Homo evolutis
