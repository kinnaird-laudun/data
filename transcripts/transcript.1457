<title>Jackson Katz: Violence against women -- it&#39;s a men&#39;s issue | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Domestic violence and sexual abuse are often called &quot;women&#39;s issues.&quot; But in this bold, blunt talk, Jackson Katz points out that these are intrinsically men&#39;s issues -- and shows how these violent behaviors are tied to definitions of manhood. A clarion call for us all -- women and men -- to call out unacceptable behavior and be leaders of change." />

<meta content='Domestic violence and sexual abuse are often called "women&#x0027;s issues." But in this bold, blunt talk, Jackson Katz points out that these are intrinsically men&#x0027;s issues — and shows how these violent behaviors are tied to definitions of manhood.

											I&#39;m going to share with you
a paradigm-shifting perspective
											on the issues of gender violence:
sexual assault, domestic violence,
											relationship abuse, sexual harassment,
sexual abuse of children.
											That whole range of issues
											that I&#39;ll refer to in shorthand
as &quot;gender violence issues,&quot;
											they&#39;ve been seen as women&#39;s issues
that some good men help out with,
											but I have a problem with that frame
and I don&#39;t accept it.
											I don&#39;t see these as women&#39;s issues
that some good men help out with.
											In fact, I&#39;m going to argue
that these are men&#39;s issues,
											first and foremost.
											Now obviously —

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Obviously, they&#39;re also women&#39;s issues,
so I appreciate that,
											but calling gender violence
a women&#39;s issue is part of the problem,
											for a number of reasons.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The first is that it gives men
an excuse not to pay attention, right?
											A lot of men hear
the term &quot;women&#39;s issues&quot;
											and we tend to tune it out, and we think,
											&quot;I&#39;m a guy; that&#39;s for the girls,&quot;
or &quot;that&#39;s for the women.&quot;
											And a lot of men literally don&#39;t get
beyond the first sentence as a result.
											It&#39;s almost like a chip
in our brain is activated,
											and the neural pathways take
our attention in a different direction
											when we hear the term &quot;women&#39;s issues.&quot;
											This is also true, by the way,
of the word &quot;gender,&quot;
											because a lot of people
hear the word &quot;gender&quot;
											and they think it means &quot;women.&quot;
											So they think that gender issues
is synonymous with women&#39;s issues.
											There&#39;s some confusion
about the term gender.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And let me illustrate
that confusion by way of analogy.
											So let&#39;s talk for a moment about race.
											In the US, when we hear the word &quot;race,&quot;
											a lot of people think
that means African-American,
											Latino, Asian-American, Native American,
											South Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.
											A lot of people, when they hear
the word &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
											think it means gay, lesbian, bisexual.
											And a lot of people,
when they hear the word &quot;gender,&quot;
											think it means women.
											In each case, the dominant group
doesn&#39;t get paid attention to.
											As if white people don&#39;t have
some sort of racial identity
											or belong to some racial
category or construct,
											as if heterosexual people
don&#39;t have a sexual orientation,
											as if men don&#39;t have a gender.
											This is one of the ways that dominant
systems maintain and reproduce themselves,
											which is to say the dominant group
is rarely challenged
											to even think about its dominance,
											because that&#39;s one of the key
characteristics of power and privilege,
											the ability to go unexamined,
											lacking introspection, in fact being
rendered invisible, in large measure,
											in the discourse about issues
that are primarily about us.
											And this is amazing how this works
in domestic and sexual violence,

											It starts with a very basic
English sentence:
											&quot;John beat Mary.&quot;
											That&#39;s a good English sentence.
											John is the subject, beat is the verb,
Mary is the object, good sentence.
											Now we&#39;re going to move
to the second sentence,
											which says the same thing
in the passive voice.
											&quot;Mary was beaten by John.&quot;
											And now a whole lot
has happened in one sentence.
											We&#39;ve gone from &quot;John beat Mary&quot;
											to &quot;Mary was beaten by John.&quot;
											We&#39;ve shifted our focus
in one sentence from John to Mary,
											and you can see John is very close
to the end of the sentence,
											well, close to dropping
off the map of our psychic plain.
											The third sentence, John is dropped,
											and we have, &quot;Mary was beaten,&quot;
											and now it&#39;s all about Mary.
											We&#39;re not even thinking about John,
it&#39;s totally focused on Mary.
											Over the past generation,
											the term we&#39;ve used
synonymous with &quot;beaten&quot; is &quot;battered,&quot;
											so we have &quot;Mary was battered.&quot;
											And the final sentence in this sequence,
flowing from the others, is,
											&quot;Mary is a battered woman.&quot;
											So now Mary&#39;s very identity —
Mary is a battered woman —
											is what was done to her by John
in the first instance.
											But we&#39;ve demonstrated that John
has long ago left the conversation.

											Those of us who work
in the domestic and sexual violence field

is pervasive in this realm,

why does John beat Mary?

that men can play in this work

											And by the way, one of the things
that really bothers me
											about some of the rhetoric
against feminists and others
											who have built the battered women&#39;s
and rape crisis movements around the world
											is that somehow, like I said,
that they&#39;re anti-male.
											What about all the boys who are profoundly
affected in a negative way
											by what some adult man is doing against
their mother, themselves, their sisters?
											What about all those boys?
											What about all the young men and boys
											who have been traumatized
by adult men&#39;s violence?
											You know what?
											The same system that produces
men who abuse women,
											produces men who abuse other men.
											And if we want to talk about male victims,
let&#39;s talk about male victims.
											Most male victims of violence
are the victims of other men&#39;s violence.
											So that&#39;s something that both women
and men have in common.
											We are both victims of men&#39;s violence.
											So we have it in our direct self-interest,
											not to mention the fact
that most men that I know
											have women and girls
that we care deeply about,
											in our families and our friendship
circles and every other way.
											So there&#39;s so many reasons
why we need men to speak out.
											It seems obvious saying it
out loud, doesn&#39;t it?
											Now, the nature of the work
that I do and my colleagues do
											in the sports culture
and the US military, in schools,
											we pioneered this approach
called the bystander approach
											to gender-violence prevention.

									<p>
											And I just want to give you
the highlights of the bystander approach,
											because it&#39;s a big thematic shift,
											although there&#39;s lots of particulars,
											but the heart of it is,
instead of seeing men as perpetrators
											and women as victims,
											or women as perpetrators, men as victims,
											or any combination in there.
											I&#39;m using the gender binary.
											I know there&#39;s more than men and women,
there&#39;s more than male and female.
											And there are women who are perpetrators,
											and of course there are
men who are victims.
											There&#39;s a whole spectrum.
											But instead of seeing it
in the binary fashion,
											we focus on all of us
as what we call bystanders,
											and a bystander is defined as anybody
who is not a perpetrator or a victim
											in a given situation,
											so in other words friends, teammates,
colleagues, coworkers, family members,
											those of us who are not directly
involved in a dyad of abuse,
											but we are embedded in social,
family, work, school,
											and other peer culture relationships
											with people who might be
in that situation.
											What do we do? How do we speak up?
How do we challenge our friends?
											How do we support our friends?
											But how do we not remain silent
in the face of abuse?

											Now, when it comes
to men and male culture,
											the goal is to get men who are not abusive
to challenge men who are.
											And when I say abusive, I don&#39;t mean just
men who are beating women.
											We&#39;re not just saying a man whose friend
is abusing his girlfriend
											needs to stop the guy
at the moment of attack.
											That&#39;s a naive way
of creating a social change.
											It&#39;s along a continuum, we&#39;re trying
to get men to interrupt each other.
											So, for example, if you&#39;re a guy
and you&#39;re in a group of guys
											playing poker, talking, hanging out,
no women present,
											and another guy says something sexist
or degrading or harassing about women,
											instead of laughing along
or pretending you didn&#39;t hear it,
											we need men to say,
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s not funny.
											that could be my sister
you&#39;re talking about,
											and could you joke about something else?
											Or could you talk about something else?
											I don&#39;t appreciate that kind of talk.&quot;
											Just like if you&#39;re a white person
											and another white person makes
a racist comment, you&#39;d hope, I hope,
											that white people would interrupt
that racist enactment
											by a fellow white person.
											Just like with heterosexism,
if you&#39;re a heterosexual person
											and you yourself don&#39;t enact
harassing or abusive behaviors
											towards people of varying
sexual orientations,
											if you don&#39;t say something in the face
of other heterosexual people doing that,
											then, in a sense, isn&#39;t your silence
a form of consent and complicity?

											Well, the bystander approach
is trying to give people tools
											to interrupt that process and to speak up
and to create a peer culture climate
											where the abusive behavior
will be seen as unacceptable,
											not just because it&#39;s illegal,
but because it&#39;s wrong
											and unacceptable in the peer culture.
											And if we can get to the place where men
											who act out in sexist ways
will lose status,
											young men and boys who act out in sexist
											and harassing ways
towards girls and women,
											as well as towards other boys and men,
											will lose status
as a result of it, guess what?
											We&#39;ll see a radical
diminution of the abuse.
											Because the typical perpetrator
is not sick and twisted.
											He&#39;s a normal guy
in every other way, isn&#39;t he?
