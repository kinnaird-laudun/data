											I&#39;m going to speak today about the relationship
											between science and human values.
											Now, it&#39;s generally understood that
											questions of morality —
											questions of good and evil and right and wrong —
											are questions about which science officially has no opinion.
											It&#39;s thought that science can help us
											get what we value,
											but it can never tell us what we ought to value.
											And, consequently, most people — I think most people
											probably here — think that science will never answer
											the most important questions in human life:
											questions like, &quot;What is worth living for?&quot;
											&quot;What is worth dying for?&quot;
											&quot;What constitutes a good life?&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, I&#39;m going to argue
											that this is an illusion — that the separation between
											science and human values is an illusion —
											and actually quite a dangerous one
											at this point in human history.
											Now, it&#39;s often said that science
											cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,
											because science deals with facts,
											and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.
											It&#39;s often thought that there&#39;s no description
											of the way the world is
											that can tell us how the world ought to be.
											But I think this is quite clearly untrue.
											Values are a certain kind of fact.
											They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Why is it that we don&#39;t have ethical obligations toward rocks?
											Why don&#39;t we feel compassion for rocks?
											It&#39;s because we don&#39;t think rocks can suffer. And if we&#39;re more
											concerned about our fellow primates
											than we are about insects, as indeed we are,
											it&#39;s because we think they&#39;re exposed to a greater range
											of potential happiness and suffering.
											Now, the crucial thing to notice here
											is that this is a factual claim:
											This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we
											have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity
											and the possibilities of experience
											well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.

									<p>
											And there&#39;s no notion,
											no version of human morality
											and human values that I&#39;ve ever come across
											that is not at some point reducible
											to a concern about conscious experience
											and its possible changes.
											Even if you get your values from religion,
											even if you think that good and evil ultimately
											relate to conditions after death —
											either to an eternity of happiness with God
											or an eternity of suffering in hell —
											you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.
											And to say that such changes can persist after death
											is itself a factual claim,
											which, of course, may or may not be true.

											Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being
											in this life, for human beings,
											we know that there is a continuum of such facts.
											We know that it&#39;s possible to live in a failed state,
											where everything that can go wrong does go wrong —
											where mothers cannot feed their children,
											where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,
											where people are murdered indiscriminately.
											And we know that it&#39;s possible to move along this continuum
											towards something quite a bit more idyllic,
											to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.

											So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.
											Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels —

											on up to the level of economic systems

											But if we&#39;re going to talk about human well-being

											whatever happens after death.
											Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,

											So the contributions of culture —
											if culture changes us, as indeed it does,
											it changes us by changing our brains.

											Now, let me be clear about what I&#39;m not saying. I&#39;m not saying

											I don&#39;t think, for instance, that you will one day consult

											But if questions affect human well-being
											then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.
											And just admitting this —
											just admitting that there are right and wrong answers

											will change the way we talk about morality,

											Now, many of you might worry
											that the notion of well-being is truly undefined,

											And so, how therefore can there be an

											Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.
											The concept of physical health is undefined.
											As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.
											When this statue was carved
											the average life expectancy was probably 30.
											It&#39;s now around 80 in the developed world.
											There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes

											Notice that the fact that the concept of health
											is open, genuinely open for revision,
											does not make it vacuous.
											The distinction between a healthy person

											Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:
											There may be equivalent ways to thrive;
											there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society

											Now, why wouldn&#39;t this
											undermine an objective morality?
											Well think of how we talk about food:
											I would never be tempted to argue to you
											that there must be one right food to eat.
											There is clearly a range of materials
											that constitute healthy food.
											But there&#39;s nevertheless a clear distinction
											between food and poison.
											The fact that there are many right answers
											to the question, &quot;What is food?&quot;
											does not tempt us
											to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
											Many people worry

											So, for instance, if it&#39;s really wrong to lie,
											it must always be wrong to lie,

											Why would we think this?
											Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.
											Now, if you&#39;re going to play good chess,
											a principle like, &quot;Don&#39;t lose your Queen,&quot;
											is very good to follow.

											There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.

											Now, granted, for many men

											&quot;Is this the perfect expression
											of psychological balance
											with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women&#39;s bodies?&quot;
											I mean, is this the optimal environment
											in which to raise our children?

											So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning

											that potentially falls within the purview of science.

											SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact,
											that you can love someone
											in the context of a truly delusional belief system.
											So, you can say like, &quot;Because I knew my gay son
											was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,
											I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do.&quot;
											If you get all those parts aligned,
											yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.
											But again, then we have to talk about
											well-being in a larger context.
											It&#39;s all of us in this together,
											not one man feeling ecstasy
											and then blowing himself up on a bus.
