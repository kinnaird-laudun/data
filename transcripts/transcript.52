											You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel
											and one of the delights of ethnographic research
											is the opportunity to live amongst those
											who have not forgotten the old ways,
											who still feel their past in the wind,
											touch it in stones polished by rain,
											taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.
											Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,
											or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,
											or that in the Himalaya,
											the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,
											is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,
											and that is the idea that the world in which we live
											does not exist in some absolute sense,
											but is just one model of reality,
											the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices
											that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.

									<p>
											And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.
											We&#39;re all born. We all bring our children into the world.
											We go through initiation rites.
											We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death,
											so it shouldn&#39;t surprise us that we all sing, we all dance,
											we all have art.

											But what&#39;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song,
											the rhythm of the dance in every culture.
											And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo,
											or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti,
											or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya,
											the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes,
											or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara —
											this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with
											a month ago —
											or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma,
											Everest, the goddess mother of the world.

											All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being,
											other ways of thinking,
											other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.
											And this is an idea, if you think about it,
											can only fill you with hope.
											Now, together the myriad cultures of the world
											make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life
											that envelops the planet,
											and is as important to the well-being of the planet
											as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.
											And you might think of this cultural web of life
											as being an ethnosphere,
											and you might define the ethnosphere
											as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,
											ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being
											by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.
											The ethnosphere is humanity&#39;s great legacy.
											It&#39;s the symbol of all that we are
											and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.

											And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,
											so too is the ethnosphere
											— and, if anything, at a far greater rate.
											No biologists, for example, would dare suggest
											that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are
											on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,
											and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario
											in the realm of biological diversity —
											scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario
											in the realm of cultural diversity.
											And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.

											When each of you in this room were born,
											there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.
											Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary
											or a set of grammatical rules.
											A language is a flash of the human spirit.
											It&#39;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture
											comes into the material world.
											Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind,
											a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.

											Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with,

											an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.
											In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact
											and made a critical mistake.
											They dropped from the air
											8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves
											in what we would say to be friendly gestures,
											forgetting that these people of the rainforest
											had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.
											They picked up these photographs from the forest floor,
											tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure,
											found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards
											from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.
											But the Waorani didn&#39;t just spear outsiders.
											They speared each other.
											54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.
											We traced genealogies back eight generations,
											and we found two instances of natural death
											and when we pressured the people a little bit about it,
											they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old
											that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter)
											But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge

											had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did
											and Voodoo is simply the distillation
											of these very profound religious ideas
											that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.
											But, what makes Voodoo so interesting
											is that it&#39;s this living relationship
											between the living and the dead.
											So, the living give birth to the spirits.
											The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,
											responding to the rhythm of the dance
											to momentarily displace the soul of the living,
											so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.
											That&#39;s why the Voodooists like to say
											that &quot;You white people go to church and speak about God.
											We dance in the temple and become God.&quot;
											And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit —
											how can you be harmed?
											So you see these astonishing demonstrations:
											Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance
											handling burning embers with impunity,
											a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind
											to affect the body that bears it

											Now, of all the peoples that I&#39;ve ever been with,
											the most extraordinary are the Kogi
											of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.
											Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization
											which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,
											in the wake of the conquest,
											these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif
											that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.
											In a bloodstained continent,
											these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.
											To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood
											but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.
											The young acolytes are taken away from their families
											at the age of three and four,
											sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness
											in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:
											two nine-year periods
											deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation
											they spend in their natural mother&#39;s womb;
											now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.
											And for this entire time,
											they are inculturated into the values of their society,
											values that maintain the proposition that their prayers
											and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic —
											or we might say the ecological — balance.
											And at the end of this amazing initiation,
											one day they&#39;re suddenly taken out
											and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,
											they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness
											of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes
											of the stunningly beautiful landscape,
											suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract
											is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back
											and says, &quot;You see? It&#39;s really as I&#39;ve told you.
											It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect.&quot;
											They call themselves the &quot;elder brothers&quot;
											and they say we, who are the younger brothers,
											are the ones responsible for destroying the world.

											and the old canard of the &quot;noble savage,&quot;
											which is an idea racist in its simplicity,
											or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau

											There&#39;s not a lot of room for either
											in the malarial swamps of the Asmat
											or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,
											through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth
											that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,

											the idea that the Earth itself can only exist
											because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.

											Now, if you begin to look at the idea
											that these cultures could create different realities,
											you could begin to understand
											some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.
											It&#39;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.
											This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,
											the most powerful psychoactive preparation
											of the shaman&#39;s repertoire.
											What makes ayahuasca fascinating
											is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,
											but the elaboration of it. It&#39;s made really of two different sources:
											on the one hand, this woody liana
											which has in it a series of beta-carbolines,
											harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic —
											to take the vine alone
											is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke
											drift across your consciousness —
											but it&#39;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family
											called Psychotria viridis.
											This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,
											very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,
											5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.
											If you&#39;ve ever seen the Yanomami
											blowing that snuff up their noses,
											that substance they make from a different set of species
											also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
											To have that powder blown up your nose
											is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel
											lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter)
											It doesn&#39;t create the distortion of reality;
											it creates the dissolution of reality.

											In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes —
											who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era
											with his discovery of the magic mushrooms
											in Mexico in the 1930s —
											I used to argue that you couldn&#39;t classify these tryptamines
											as hallucinogenic because by the time you&#39;re under the effects
											there&#39;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)

											But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally
											because they&#39;re denatured by an enzyme
											found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.
											They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction
											with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.
											Now, the fascinating things
											are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana
											are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary
											to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.
											How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,
											do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants
											that when combined in this way,
											created a kind of biochemical version
											of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?

											Well, what does that mean?
											This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,

											all of which are referable to our eye as one species.
											And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy
											and they say, &quot;I thought you knew something about plants.
											I mean, don&#39;t you know anything?&quot; And I said, &quot;No.&quot;
											Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties
											in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.

											Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet,
											where I&#39;m doing a lot of research recently,
											you&#39;ll see it&#39;s a crude face of political domination.
											You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people
											is universally condemned, but ethnocide,
											the destruction of people&#39;s way of life, is not only not condemned,
											it&#39;s universally, in many quarters, celebrated
											as part of a development strategy.
											And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet
											until you move through it at the ground level.
											I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China
											overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa
											with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa
											that I understood the face behind the statistics
											you hear about:
											6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,
											1.2 million people killed by the cadres
											during the Cultural Revolution.
											This young man&#39;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.
											That meant he was instantly killed
											at the time of the Chinese invasion.
											His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora
											that took the people to Nepal.
											His mother was incarcerated
											for the crime of being wealthy.
											He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two
											to hide beneath her skirt tails
											because she couldn&#39;t bear to be without him.
											The sister who had done that brave deed
											was put into an education camp.
											One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband
											of Mao, and for that transgression,
											she was given seven years of hard labor.
											The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,

											The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish
											wrapped in caribou hide.
											So, this man&#39;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night
											or the blizzard that was blowing.
											He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers
											and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,
											he shaped it into the form of a blade.
											He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife
											and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.
											He skinned the dog and improvised a harness,
											took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,
											harnessed up an adjacent dog,
											and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.

											to the ethnosphere where we&#39;re going to take our audience
											to places of such cultural wonder
											that they cannot help but come away dazzled
											by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,
											embrace gradually, one by one,
											the central revelation of anthropology:
											that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,
											that we can find a way to live
											in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world
											where all of the wisdom of all peoples
											can contribute to our collective well-being.

A National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, he has been described as &ldquo;a rare combination of scientist, scholar, poet and passionate defender of all of life&rsquo;s diversity.&rdquo; Trained in anthropology and botany at Harvard, he travels the globe to live alongside indigenous people, and document their cultural practices in books, photographs, and film. His stunning photographs and evocative stories capture the viewer&#39;s imagination. As a speaker, he parlays that sense of wonder into passionate concern over the rate at which cultures and languages are disappearing -- 50 percent of the world&#39;s 7,000 languages, he says, are no longer taught to children. He argues, in the most beautiful terms, that language is much more than vocabulary and grammatical rules. Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind. &nbsp;</p><p>Indigenous cultures are not failed attempts at modernity, let alone failed attempts to be us. They are unique expressions of the human imagination and heart, unique answers to a fundamental question: What does it mean to be human and alive? When asked this question, the peoples of the world respond in 7,000 different voices, and these collectively comprise our human repertoire for dealing with all the challenges that will confront us as a species over the coming centuries.</p><p>Davis is the author of 15 books including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/serpentandrainbow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Serpent and the Rainbow</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/oneriver\" target=\"_blank\"><em>One River</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/wayfinders\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Wayfinders</em></a>. His many film credits include <em>Light at the Edge of the World</em>, an eight-hour documentary series produced for the National Geographic. In 2009 he received the Gold Medal from the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for his contributions to anthropology and conservation, and he is the 2011 recipient of the Explorers Medal, the highest award of the Explorers&rsquo; Club, and the 2012 recipient of the Fairchild Medal for Plant Exploration. His latest books are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/intothesilence\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory and the Conquest of Everest</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a

A National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, he has been described as &ldquo;a rare combination of scientist, scholar, poet and passionate defender of all of life&rsquo;s diversity.&rdquo; Trained in anthropology and botany at Harvard, he travels the globe to live alongside indigenous people, and document their cultural practices in books, photographs, and film. His stunning photographs and evocative stories capture the viewer&#39;s imagination. As a speaker, he parlays that sense of wonder into passionate concern over the rate at which cultures and languages are disappearing -- 50 percent of the world&#39;s 7,000 languages, he says, are no longer taught to children. He argues, in the most beautiful terms, that language is much more than vocabulary and grammatical rules. Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind. &nbsp;</p><p>Indigenous cultures are not failed attempts at modernity, let alone failed attempts to be us. They are unique expressions of the human imagination and heart, unique answers to a fundamental question: What does it mean to be human and alive? When asked this question, the peoples of the world respond in 7,000 different voices, and these collectively comprise our human repertoire for dealing with all the challenges that will confront us as a species over the coming centuries.</p><p>Davis is the author of 15 books including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/serpentandrainbow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Serpent and the Rainbow</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/oneriver\" target=\"_blank\"><em>One River</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/wayfinders\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Wayfinders</em></a>. His many film credits include <em>Light at the Edge of the World</em>, an eight-hour documentary series produced for the National Geographic. In 2009 he received the Gold Medal from the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for his contributions to anthropology and conservation, and he is the 2011 recipient of the Explorers Medal, the highest award of the Explorers&rsquo; Club, and the 2012 recipient of the Fairchild Medal for Plant Exploration. His latest books are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/intothesilence\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory and the Conquest of Everest</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/sacredheadwaters\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Sacred Headwaters: the Fight to Save the Stikine, Skeena and the Nass</em></a><em>.</em></p>"}],"speaker_name":"Wade Davis","tags":["anthropology","culture","environment","film","global issues","language","photography","indigenous peoples"],"title":"Dreams from endangered cultures","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2983794}]}
