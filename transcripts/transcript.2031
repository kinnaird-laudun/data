<title>Anote Tong: My country will be underwater soon -- unless we work together | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For the people of Kiribati, climate change isn&#39;t something to be debated, denied or legislated against -- it&#39;s an everyday reality. The low-lying Pacific island nation may soon be underwater, thanks to rising sea levels. In a personal conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Kiribati President Anote Tong discusses his country&#39;s present climate catastrophe and its imperiled future. &quot;In order to deal with climate change, there&#39;s got to be sacrifice. There&#39;s got to be commitment,&quot; he says. &quot;We&#39;ve got to tell people that the world has changed.&quot;" />

<meta content='For the people of Kiribati, climate change isn&#x0027;t something to be debated, denied or legislated against — it&#x0027;s an everyday reality. The low-lying Pacific island nation may soon be underwater, thanks to rising sea levels. In a personal conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Kiribati President Anote Tong discusses his country&#x0027;s present climate catastrophe and its imperiled future. "In order to deal with climate change, there&#x0027;s got to be sacrifice. There&#x0027;s got to be commitment," he says. "We&#x0027;ve got to tell people that the world has changed."' itemprop='description'>

											Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin
by saying how deeply grateful I am
											for this opportunity to share my story
with people who do care.
											I think I&#39;ve been sharing my story with
a lot of people who don&#39;t care too much.
											But Kiribati is comprised
of three groups of islands:
											the Gilbert Group on the west,
											we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,
											and the Line Islands in the east.
											And quite frankly, Kiribati
is perhaps the only country
											that is actually
in the four corners of the world,
											because we are in the Northern Hemisphere,
in the Southern Hemisphere,
											and also in the east and the west
of the International Date Line.
											These islands are entirely
made up of coral atolls,
											and on average about
two meters above sea level.
											And so this is what we have.
											Usually not more
than two kilometers in width.
											And so, on many occasions,
I&#39;ve been asked by people,
											&quot;You know, you&#39;re suffering,
why don&#39;t you move back?&quot;
											They don&#39;t understand.
											They have no concept
of what it is that&#39;s involved.
											With the rising sea, they say,
&quot;Well, you can move back.&quot;
											And so this is what I tell them.
											If we move back, we will fall off
on the other side of the ocean. OK?
											But these are the kinds of issues
that people don&#39;t understand.

											AT: Well, the story of climate change
has been one that has been going on
											for quite a number of decades.
											And when I came into office in 2003,
											I began talking about climate change
at the United Nations General Assembly,
											but not with so much passion,
											because then there was still
this controversy among the scientists
											whether it was human-induced,
whether it was real or it wasn&#39;t.
											But I think that that debate
was fairly much concluded in 2007
											with the Fourth Assessment
Report of the IPCC,
											which made a categorical statement
that it is real, it&#39;s human-induced,
											and it&#39;s predicting
some very serious scenarios
											for countries like mine.
											And so that&#39;s when I got very serious.
											In the past, I talked about it.
											We were worried.
											But when the scenarios,
the predictions came in 2007,
											it became a real issue for us.

											CA: Now, those predictions are,
I think, that by 2100,
											sea levels are forecast to rise
perhaps three feet.
											There&#39;s scenarios where
it&#39;s higher than that, for sure,
											but what would you say
to a skeptic who said,
											&quot;What&#39;s three feet?
											You&#39;re on average
six feet above sea level.

											Well, we&#39;re at the very

											We have communities
who already have been dislocated.

from different communities
											asking for assistance to build seawalls,
											to see what we can do
about the freshwater lens

to the different islands,
											I&#39;m seeing evidence of communities
											which are now having to cope
with the loss of food crops,

perhaps leaving, having to relocate,

I think somebody was asking

to visit that place.
											I had a very good reason, because we have
a community of Kiribati people
											living in that part
of the Solomon Islands,
											but these were people who were relocated
from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,
											in the 1960s.
											There was serious drought, and the people
could not continue to live on the island,
											and so they were moved
to live here in the Solomon Islands.
											And so yesterday it was very interesting
to meet with these people.
											They didn&#39;t know who I was.
They hadn&#39;t heard of me.
											Some of them later recognized me,
											but I think they were very happy.
											Later they really wanted to have
the opportunity to welcome me formally.
											But I think what I saw yesterday
was very interesting
											because here I see our people.
											I spoke in our language, and of course
they spoke back, they replied,
											but their accent, they are beginning
not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.
											I saw them, there was
this lady with red teeth.
											She was chewing betel nuts,
											and it&#39;s not something we do in Kiribati.
											We don&#39;t chew betel nuts.
											I met also a family who have married
the local people here,

											As you go into another community,
there are bound to be changes.

a certain loss of identity,

locally, it was not easy,
											but I was convinced that we had to do this
											in order to ensure
that the fishery remains sustainable.
											There had been some indications
that some of the species,
											in particular the bigeye,
was under serious threat.
											The yellowfin was also heavily fished.
											Skipjack remains healthy.
											And so we had to do something like that,
and so that was the reason I did that.
											Another reason why I did that
											was because I had been asking
the international community
											that in order to deal with climate change,
in order to fight climate change,
											there has got to be sacrifice,
there has got to be commitment.

regrettably, unfortunately,
											is viewed by many countries
as a national problem. It&#39;s not.
											And this is the argument
we got into recently with our partners,
											the Australians and New Zealanders,
											because they said,
&quot;We can&#39;t cut any more.&quot;
											This is what one of the leaders,
the Australian leader, said,
											that we&#39;ve done our part,
we are cutting back.
											I said, What about the rest?
Why don&#39;t you keep it?
											If you could keep
the rest of your emissions
											within your boundaries,
within your borders,
											we&#39;d have no question.
											You can go ahead as much as you like.
											But unfortunately,
you&#39;re sending it our way,
											and it&#39;s affecting
the future of our children.
											And so surely I think that is the heart
of the problem of climate change today.

											We will be meeting in Paris
at the end of this year,

as a global phenomenon,
											because we create it,
individually, as nations,
											but it affects everybody else,
											and yet, we refuse
to do anything about it,

dealt with collectively.

at responding to graphs and numbers,

											Somehow, to people, we&#39;re slightly better
