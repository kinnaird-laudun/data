											I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.
											I&#39;m giving a short slide show this morning
											that I&#39;m giving for the very first time, so —
											well it&#39;s — I don&#39;t want or need to raise the bar,
											I&#39;m actually trying to lower the bar.
											Because I&#39;ve cobbled this together

											And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong&#39;s fantastic presentation
											that religion really properly understood
											is not about belief, but about behavior.
											Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.
											How dare we be optimistic?
											Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.
											As Mahatma Gandhi famously said,
											&quot;You must become the change you wish to see in the world.&quot;
											And the outcome about which
											we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created
											by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief
											brings about new behavior. But the word &quot;behavior&quot;
											is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.
											I&#39;m a big advocate of changing
											the lightbulbs and buying hybrids,
											and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house,
											and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.
											But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs,
											it is more important to change the laws.
											And when we change our behavior in our daily lives,
											we sometimes leave out the citizenship part
											and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this,
											we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.
											In order to solve the climate crisis,
											we have to solve the democracy crisis.
											And we have one.

											I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.
											I was reminded of that recently, by a woman
											who walked past the table I was sitting at,
											just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s,
											looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it
											until I saw from the corner of my eye
											she was walking from the opposite direction,
											also just staring at me. And so I said, &quot;How do you do?&quot;
											And she said, &quot;You know, if you dyed your hair black,
											you would look just like Al Gore.&quot; (Laughter)

											Many years ago, when I was a young congressman,
											I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge
											of nuclear arms control — the nuclear arms race.
											And the military historians taught me,
											during that quest, that military conflicts are typically
											put into three categories: local battles,
											regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important
											global, world war — strategic conflicts.
											And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources,
											a different approach,
											a different organizational model.
											Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories,
											and most of what we think about
											are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution,
											hazardous waste dumps. But there are also
											regional environmental problems, like acid rain
											from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe
											to the Arctic, and from the Midwest
											out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.
											And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis
											is the rare but all-important
											global, or strategic, conflict.
											Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response
											appropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization
											for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency
											and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.
											We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources
											and political will. But the political will
											has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.

											Let me show you these slides here.
											I thought I would start with the logo. What&#39;s missing here,
											of course, is the North Polar ice cap.
											Greenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the
											polar ice cap — the North Polar ice cap — looked like
											at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.
											This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center
											in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers
											here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.
											This is what&#39;s happened in the last 28 years.
											To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.
											Here&#39;s what happened last fall
											that has really unnerved the researchers.
											The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically —
											doesn&#39;t look quite the same size —
											but it is exactly the same size as the United States,
											minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.
											The amount that disappeared in 2005
											was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.
											The extra amount that disappeared last fall
											was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter,
											but not as permanent ice, as thin ice —
											vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone
											in summer in as little as five years.
											That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
											Already, around the Arctic Circle —
											this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town
											in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.
											The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting
											of an area equivalent to the size of California.

											&quot;They were the best of times,
											they were the worst of times&quot;: the most famous opening sentence
											in English literature. I want to share briefly
											a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus
											are exactly the same size. Earth&#39;s diameter
											is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.
											They have exactly the same amount of carbon.
											But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon
											has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere,
											deposited in the ground as coal, oil,
											natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it
											is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature
											is 59 degrees on average. On Venus,
											it&#39;s 855. This is relevant to our current strategy
											of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,
											and putting it into the atmosphere.
											It&#39;s not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
											It&#39;s three times hotter than Mercury,
											which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly,
											here&#39;s an image you&#39;ve seen, as one of the only old images,
											but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.

											The global scientific community says:
											man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere,
											thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.
											You all know that. At the last
											IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say,
											&quot;How certain are you?&quot; They wanted to answer that &quot;99 percent.&quot;
											The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was
											&quot;more than 90 percent.&quot;
											Now, the skeptics say, &quot;Oh, wait a minute,
											this could be variations in this energy
											coming in from the sun.&quot; If that were true,
											the stratosphere would be heated as well as the
											lower atmosphere, if it&#39;s more coming in.
											If it&#39;s more being trapped on the way out, then you would
											expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.
											Here&#39;s the stratosphere: cooler.

											Now, here&#39;s the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe
											that human activity is responsible
											for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up
											in a significant way. There has been progress,
											but here is the key: when given a list
											of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.
											What is missing is a sense of urgency.
											If you agree with the factual analysis,
											but you don&#39;t feel the sense of urgency,
											where does that leave you?
											Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head
											in conjunction with Current TV — who did this pro bono —
											did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.
											This is the winner.

											NBC — I&#39;ll show all of the networks here — the top journalists
											for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007
											of the presidential candidates: two of them were about
											the climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.
											Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.
											From laughs to tears — this is one of the older
											tobacco commercials.
											So here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing.
											This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.
											But it&#39;s not just the developed nations.
											The developing countries are now following us
											and accelerating their pace. And actually,
											their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent
											to where we were in 1965. And they&#39;re catching up
											very dramatically. The total concentrations:
											by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.
											If the wealthy countries were completely missing
											from the picture, we would still have this crisis.
											But we have given to the developing countries
											the technologies and the ways of thinking
											that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia —

											Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral,
											to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck —
											and some things have changed

											But responses can actually make a huge difference

											This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating
											solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called &quot;supergrid&quot;
											to supply all of the electrical power
											to Europe, largely from developing countries — high-voltage DC currents.

											We need to do it for our own economy.
											The latest figures show that the old model
											is not working. There are a lot of great investments
											that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands
											or shale oil, then you have a portfolio
											that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.
											And it is based on an old model.
											Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones
											in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands
											and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments

											You&#39;ve seen this slide before, but there&#39;s a change.
											The only two countries that didn&#39;t ratify
											— and now there&#39;s only one. Australia had an election.
											And there was a campaign in Australia
											that involved television and Internet and radio commercials
											to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.
											And we trained 250 people to give the slide show
											in every town and village and city in Australia.
											Lot of other things contributed to it,
											but the new Prime Minister announced that
											his very first priority would be to change Australia&#39;s position
											on Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness
											partly because of the horrible drought that they have had.
											This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen
											said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names,
											we&#39;d call the one in the southeast now Katrina,
											and we would say it&#39;s headed toward Atlanta.
											We can&#39;t wait for the kind of drought
											Australia had to change our political culture.
											Here&#39;s more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
											are up to 780 — and I thought I saw one go by there,
											just to localize this — which is good news.

											Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago
											about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace
											that it becomes banal or routine.
											What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive
											in the United States of America
											today especially, but also the rest of the world,
											have to somehow understand that history
											has presented us with a choice — just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out
											how to save her life while she was distracted
											by the amazing experience that she was going through.
											We now have a culture of distraction.
											But we have a planetary emergency.
											And we have to find a way to create,
											in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.
											I wish I could find the words to convey this.
											This was another hero generation
											that brought democracy to the planet.
											Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.
											We can do this. Don&#39;t tell me that we don&#39;t have the capacity to do it.
											If we had just one week&#39;s worth of what we spend on the Iraq War,
											we could be well on the way to solving this challenge.

											One final point: I&#39;m optimistic, because I believe
											we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge,
											to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge
											that history is presenting to us.
											Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis
											by saying, &quot;Oh, this is so terrible.
											What a burden we have.&quot; I would like to ask you
											to reframe that. How many generations
											in all of human history have had the opportunity
											to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?
											A challenge that can pull from us
											more than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach
											this challenge with a sense of profound joy
											and gratitude that we are the generation
											about which, a thousand years from now,
											philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate
											by saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves
											to solve this crisis and lay the basis
											for a bright and optimistic human future.

											This challenge is part of the fabric
											of our whole civilization.
											CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.
											And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern
											requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change
											that is beyond what we have done in the past.
											So that&#39;s why I began by saying,
											be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.
											Demand — change the light bulbs,
											but change the laws. Change the global treaties.
											We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy — this —
											We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.
											Use the Internet. Go on the Internet.
											Connect with people. Become very active as citizens.
											Have a moratorium — we shouldn&#39;t
											have any new coal-fired generating plants
											that aren&#39;t able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to
											quickly build these renewable sources.
											Now, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe
											that between now and November, it is possible.
											This Alliance for Climate Protection
											is going to launch a nationwide campaign —
											grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads,
											radio, newspaper — with partnerships with everybody
											from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.
