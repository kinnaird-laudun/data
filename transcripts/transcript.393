											There was this wonderful review in The New York Times

											I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better,

											I&#39;m going to put a plank on the ground.
											So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long

											So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn&#39;t really have it down
											until just a few days or hours before the talk,
											and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
											That&#39;s what fear and anxiety does;
											it causes you to be — what&#39;s called depth-first processing —
											to focus, not be distracted.
											And I couldn&#39;t force myself across that.
											Now some people can — circus workers, steel workers.

											And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen,
											did this wonderful experiment.
											She brought students in to solve problems.
											So, she&#39;d bring people into the room,
											and there&#39;d be a string hanging down here
											and a string hanging down here.
											It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it —
											some papers and scissors and stuff.
											And she&#39;d bring them in,
											and she&#39;d say,
											&quot;This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
											Would you tie those two strings together?&quot;
											So they&#39;d take one string and they&#39;d pull it over here
											and they couldn&#39;t reach the other string.
											Still can&#39;t reach it.
											And, basically, none of them could solve it.
											You bring in a second group of people,

											And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy —
											not very happy, but a little bit of happy.
											And guess what — they solved the problem.
											And it turns out that when you&#39;re anxious
											you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you
											makes you depth-first.
											And when you&#39;re happy — what we call positive valence —
											you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes,
											which makes you a breadth-first problem solver:
											you&#39;re more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.
											That&#39;s what brainstorming is about, right?
											With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games,
											and we say, &quot;No criticism,&quot;
											and you get all these weird, neat ideas.
											But in fact, if that&#39;s how you always were you&#39;d never get any work done
											because you&#39;d be working along and say, &quot;Oh, I got a new way of doing it.&quot;
											So to get work done, you&#39;ve got to set a deadline, right?
											You&#39;ve got be anxious.
											The brain works differently
											if you&#39;re happy. Things work better because you&#39;re more creative.
											You get a little problem, you say, &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll figure it out.&quot;
											No big deal.

											There&#39;s something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.
											Biology — we have co-adapted through biology to
like bright colors.
											That&#39;s especially good that mammals and primates like fruits
											and bright plants, because you eat the fruit
											and you thereby spread the seed.
											There&#39;s an amazing amount of stuff that&#39;s built into the brain.
											We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds,
											we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.
											We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces;
											we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.
											So that&#39;s the visceral level.
											In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways,
											like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.
											Or the 1963 Jaguar:
											It&#39;s actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time,
											but the owners love it.
											And it&#39;s beautiful — it&#39;s in the Museum of Modern Art.
											A water bottle:
											You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.
											And when people are finished, they don&#39;t throw it away.
											They keep it for — you know, it&#39;s like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration
											or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it&#39;s not the water.
											It&#39;s all about the visceral experience.

											The middle level of processing is the behavioral level
											and that&#39;s actually where most of our stuff gets done.
											Visceral is subconscious, you&#39;re unaware of it.
											Behavioral is subconscious, you&#39;re unaware of it.
											Almost everything we do is subconscious.
											I&#39;m walking around the stage — I&#39;m not attending to the control of my legs.
											I&#39;m doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious;
											it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.
											Most of what we do is subconscious.
											Automatic behavior — skilled behavior — is subconscious,
											controlled by the behavioral side.
											And behavioral design is all about feeling in control,
											which includes usability, understanding —
											but also the feel and heft.

											Or this — this is a really neat teapot I found
											at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
											It&#39;s a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.
											That&#39;s kind of what the teapot looks like
											but the way you use it is you lay it on its back,
											and you put tea in,
											and then you fill it with water.
											The water then seeps over the tea.
											And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right —
											the tea is to the right of this line.
											There&#39;s a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there
											and the water is filling it up like that.
											And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
											And that means the tea is partially covered
											while it completes the brewing.
											And when it&#39;s finished, you put it vertically,
											and now the tea is — you remember — above this line
											and the water only comes to here —
											and so it keeps the tea out.
											On top of that, it communicates,
											which is what emotion does.

											Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.
											It&#39;s being safe in the world.
											Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it —
											saying good, bad, safe, dangerous,
											and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.
											And that&#39;s why we can tell the emotion of somebody else —
											because their muscles are acting, subconsciously,
											except that we&#39;ve evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.
											Well, this has emotions if you like,
											because it signals the waiter that, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m finished. See — upright.&quot;

											And the third level is reflective,
											which is, if you like the superego,
											it&#39;s a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do,
											no control over the — doesn&#39;t see the senses,
											doesn&#39;t control the muscles.
											It looks over what&#39;s going on.
											It&#39;s that little voice in your head

											Here&#39;s a great reflective product.
											Owners of the Hummer have said, &quot;You know I&#39;ve owned many cars in my life —
											all sorts of exotic cars,
											but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention.&quot;
											It&#39;s about attention. It&#39;s about their image,
											not about the car.
											If you want a more positive model —
											this is the GM car.
											And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.
											And you&#39;ll buy it to protect the environment,
											even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive
											and not perfected.
											But that&#39;s reflective design as well.
											Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people —
											&quot;Oh gee, I didn&#39;t know you had that watch.&quot;
											As opposed to this one,
											which is a pure behavioral watch,
											which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.
