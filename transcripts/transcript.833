											I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time
											traveling around the world these days,
											talking to groups of students and professionals,
											and everywhere I&#39;m finding that I hear similar themes.
											On the one hand, people say,
											&quot;The time for change is now.&quot;
											They want to be part of it.
											They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.
											But on the other hand,
											I hear people talking about fear,
											a sense of risk-aversion.
											They say, &quot;I really want to follow a life of purpose,
											but I don&#39;t know where to start.
											I don&#39;t want to disappoint my family or friends.&quot;
											I work in global poverty.
											And they say, &quot;I want to work in global poverty,
											but what will it mean about my career?
											Will I be marginalized?
											Will I not make enough money?
											Will I never get married or have children?&quot;
											And as a woman who didn&#39;t get married until I was a lot older —
											and I&#39;m glad I waited —
											(Laughter)
											— and has no children,
											I look at these young people
											and I say, &quot;Your job is not to be perfect.
											Your job is only to be human.
											And nothing important happens in life
											without a cost.&quot;
											These conversations really reflect what&#39;s happening
											at the national and international level.
											Our leaders and ourselves
											want everything,
											but we don&#39;t talk about the costs.
											We don&#39;t talk about the sacrifice.

											One of my favorite quotes from literature
											was written by Tillie Olsen,
											the great American writer from the South.
											In a short story called &quot;Oh Yes,&quot;
											she talks about a white woman in the 1950s
											who has a daughter
											who befriends a little African American girl,
											and she looks at her child with a sense of pride,
											but she also wonders,
											what price will she pay?
											&quot;Better immersion
											than to live untouched.&quot;
											But the real question is,
											what is the cost of not daring?
											What is the cost of not trying?

											I&#39;ve been so privileged in my life
											to know extraordinary leaders
											who have chosen to live lives of immersion.
											One woman I knew who was a fellow
											at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation
											was named Ingrid Washinawatok.
											She was a leader of the Menominee tribe,
											a Native American peoples.
											And when we would gather as fellows,
											she would push us to think about
											how the elders in Native American culture
											make decisions.
											And she said they would literally visualize
											the faces of children
											for seven generations into the future,
											looking at them from the Earth,
											and they would look at them, holding them as stewards
											for that future.
											Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other,
											not only as human beings,
											but to every living thing on the planet.

											And tragically, in 1999,
											when she was in Colombia
											working with the U&#39;wa people,
											focused on preserving their culture and language,
											she and two colleagues were abducted
											and tortured and killed by the FARC.
											And whenever we would gather the fellows after that,
											we would leave a chair empty for her spirit.
											And more than a decade later,
											when I talk to NGO fellows,
											whether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House,
											and we talk about Ingrid,
											they all say that they&#39;re trying to integrate her wisdom
											and her spirit
											and really build on the unfulfilled work
											of her life&#39;s mission.
											And when we think about legacy,
											I can think of no more powerful one,
											despite how short her life was.

											And I&#39;ve been touched by Cambodian women —
											beautiful women,
											women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.
											And I met them in the early &#39;90s.
											In the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime,
											the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people,
											and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals,
											the artists, the dancers.
											And at the end of the war,
											there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.
											And the women, who I was so privileged to meet
											when there were three survivors,
											told these stories about lying in their cots
											in the refugee camps.
											They said they would try so hard
											to remember the fragments of the dance,
											hoping that others were alive and doing the same.

											And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage,
											her hands at her side,
											and she talked about
											the reunion of the 30 after the war
											and how extraordinary it was.
											And these big tears fell down her face,
											but she never lifted her hands to move them.
											And the women decided that they would train
											not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already,
											but the next generation.
											And I sat there in the studio
											watching these women clapping their hands —
											beautiful rhythms —
											as these little fairy pixies
											were dancing around them,
											wearing these beautiful silk colors.
											And I thought, after all this atrocity,
											this is how human beings really pray.
											Because they&#39;re focused on honoring
											what is most beautiful about our past
											and building it into
											the promise of our future.
											And what these women understood
											is sometimes the most important things that we do
											and that we spend our time on
											are those things that we cannot measure.

											I also have been touched
											by the dark side of power and leadership.
											And I have learned that power,
											particularly in its absolute form,
											is an equal opportunity provider.
											In 1986, I moved to Rwanda,
											and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women
											to start that country&#39;s first microfinance bank.
											And one of the women was Agnes —
											there on your extreme left —
											she was one of the first three
											women parliamentarians in Rwanda,
											and her legacy should have been
											to be one of the mothers of Rwanda.
											We built this institution based on social justice,
											gender equity,
											this idea of empowering women.

											But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power
											than she did principle at the end.
											And though she had been part of building a liberal party,
											a political party
											that was focused on diversity and tolerance,
											about three months before the genocide, she switched parties
											and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power,
											and she became the Minister of Justice
											under the genocide regime
											and was known for inciting men to kill faster
											and stop behaving like women.
											She was convicted
											of category one crimes of genocide.
											And I would visit her in the prisons,
											sitting side-by-side, knees touching,
											and I would have to admit to myself
											that monsters exist in all of us,
											but that maybe it&#39;s not monsters so much,
											but the broken parts of ourselves,
											sadnesses, secret shame,
											and that ultimately it&#39;s easy for demagogues
											to prey on those parts,
											those fragments, if you will,
											and to make us look at other beings, human beings,
											as lesser than ourselves —
											and in the extreme, to do terrible things.

											And there is no group
											more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations
											than young men.
											I&#39;ve heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet
											is the adolescent male.
											And so in a gathering
											where we&#39;re focused on women,
											while it is so critical that we invest in our girls
											and we even the playing field
											and we find ways to honor them,
											we have to remember that the girls and the women

											Sometimes very small investments

											One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization,
											Suraj Sudhakar,
											has what we call moral imagination —
											the ability to put yourself in another person&#39;s shoes

											And he&#39;s been working with this young group of men
											who come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.
											And they&#39;re incredible guys.
											And together they started a book club
											for a hundred people in the slums,
											and they&#39;re reading many TED authors and liking it.
											And then they created a business plan competition.

											And I have learned so much
											from Chris and Kevin
											and Alex and Herbert
											and all of these young men.
											Alex, in some ways, said it best.
											He said, &quot;We used to feel like nobodies,
											but now we feel like somebodies.&quot;
											And I think we have it all wrong
											when we think that income is the link.
											What we really yearn for as human beings
											is to be visible to each other.
											And the reason these young guys
											told me that they&#39;re doing these TEDx&#39;s
											is because they were sick and tired
											of the only workshops coming to the slums
											being those workshops focused on HIV,
											or at best, microfinance.
											And they wanted to celebrate

											My own work focuses
											on making philanthropy more effective
											and capitalism more inclusive.
											At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources
											and we invest what we call patient capital —
											money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor
											not as passive recipients of charity,
											but as full-bodied agents of change
											who want to solve their own problems
											and make their own decisions.
											We leave our money for 10 to 15 years,
											and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations
											that focus on change.
											I know it works.
											We&#39;ve invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies,
											and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars
											into these forgotten markets.
											This year alone, they&#39;ve delivered 40 million services
											like maternal health care and housing,
											emergency services, solar energy,
											so that people can have more dignity
											in solving their problems.

											Patient capital is uncomfortable
											for people searching for simple solutions,
											easy categories,
											because we don&#39;t see profit as a blunt instrument.
											But we find those entrepreneurs
											who put people and the planet
											before profit.
											And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement
											that is about measuring impact,
											measuring what is most important to us.
											And my dream is we&#39;ll have a world one day
											where we don&#39;t just honor those who take money
											and make more money from it,
											but we find those individuals who take our resources
											and convert it into changing the world
											in the most positive ways.

											Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period
											where I saw two visions of the world
											living side-by-side —
											one based on violence
											and the other on transcendence.
											I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan
											on the day that two mosques were attacked
											by suicide bombers.
											And the reason these mosques were attacked
											is because the people praying inside
											were from a particular sect of Islam
											who fundamentalists don&#39;t believe are fully Muslim.
											And not only did those suicide bombers
											take a hundred lives,
											but they did more,
											because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear
											and certainly despair.

											But less than 24 hours,
											I was 13 miles away from those mosques,
											visiting one of our Acumen investees,
											an incredible man, Jawad Aslam,
											who dares to live a life of immersion.
											Born and raised in Baltimore,
											he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate,
											and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.
											For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend,
											but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer
											named Tasneem Saddiqui.
											And he had a dream that he would build a housing community
											on this barren piece of land
											using patient capital,
											but he continued to pay a price.
											He stood on moral ground
											and refused to pay bribes.
											It took almost two years just to register the land.
											But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise
											from one person&#39;s action.

											Today, 2,000 people live in 300 houses
											in this beautiful community.
											And there&#39;s schools and clinics and shops.
											But there&#39;s only one mosque.
											And so I asked Jawad,
											&quot;How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.
											Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?&quot;
											He said, &quot;Long story.
											It was hard, it was a difficult road,
											but ultimately the leaders of the community came together,
											realizing we only have each other.
											And we decided that we would elect
											the three most respected imams,
											and those imams would take turns,
											they would rotate who would say Friday prayer.
											But the whole community,
											all the different sects, including Shi&#39;a and Sunni,
											would sit together and pray.&quot;

											We need that kind of moral leadership and courage

											We face huge issues as a world —

											global warming
											and this growing sense of fear and otherness.
											And every day we have a choice.
											We can take the easier road,
											the more cynical road,
											which is a road based on
											sometimes dreams of a past that never really was,
											a fear of each other,

											I had the great honor
											of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles,
											who stood up for change
											during the Civil Rights movement in the United States.
											And he tells this incredible story
											about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges,
											the first child to desegregate schools in the South —
											in this case, New Orleans.
											And he said that every day
											this six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress,
											would walk with real grace
											through a phalanx of white people
											screaming angrily, calling her a monster,
											threatening to poison her —
											distorted faces.
											And every day he would watch her,
											and it looked like she was talking to the people.
											And he would say, &quot;Ruby, what are you saying?&quot;
											And she&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;m not talking.&quot;
											And finally he said, &quot;Ruby, I see that you&#39;re talking.
											What are you saying?&quot;
											And she said, &quot;Dr. Coles, I am not talking;
											I&#39;m praying.&quot;
											And he said, &quot;Well, what are you praying?&quot;
											And she said, &quot;I&#39;m praying, &#39;Father, forgive them,
											for they know not what they are doing.&#39;&quot;
											At age six,
											this child was living a life of immersion,
											and her family paid a price for it.
											But she became part of history
											and opened up this idea
											that all of us should have access to education.

											My final story is about a young, beautiful man
											named Josephat Byaruhanga,
											who was another Acumen Fund fellow,
											who hails from Uganda, a farming community.
											And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya,
											just 200 miles away.
											And he said to me at the end of his year,
											&quot;Jacqueline, it was so humbling,
											because I thought as a farmer and as an African
											I would understand how to transcend culture.
											But especially when I was talking to the African women,
											I sometimes made these mistakes —
											it was so hard for me to learn how to listen.&quot;
											And he said, &quot;So I conclude that, in many ways,
											leadership is like a panicle of rice.
											Because at the height of the season,
											at the height of its powers,
											it&#39;s beautiful, it&#39;s green, it nourishes the world,
											it reaches to the heavens.&quot;
											And he said, &quot;But right before the harvest,
											it bends over
											with great gratitude and humility
											to touch the earth from where it came.&quot;

											We need leaders.
											We ourselves need to lead
											from a place that has the audacity
											to believe we can, ourselves,
											extend the fundamental assumption
											that all men are created equal
											to every man, woman and child on this planet.
											And we need to have the humility to recognize
											that we cannot do it alone.
											Robert Kennedy once said
											that &quot;few of us have the greatness to bend history itself,
											but each of us can work
											to change a small portion of events.&quot;
											And it is in the total of all those acts
											that the history of this generation will be written.
											Our lives are so short,

											So may each of you

So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/jacqueline_novogratz_inspiring_a_life_of_immersion","viewed_count":901861,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"We each want to live a life of purpose, but where to start?

Her organization, Acumen, invests in people, companies and ideas that see capital and networks as means, not ends, to solving the toughest issues of poverty.","whylisten":"<p>Jacqueline Novogratz writes: &quot;I want to build a movement in which we define success based on the amount of human energy we release in the world. </p><p>&quot;I started my career on Wall Street and soon discovered that markets are efficient, but by themselves they too often overlook or exploit the poor.  So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jacqueline Novogratz","tags":["culture","economics","global issues","investment","women in business"],"title":"Inspiring a life of immersion","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":901861}]}
