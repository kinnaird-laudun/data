<title>Vikram Patel: Mental health for all by involving all | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nearly 450 million people are affected by mental illness worldwide. In wealthy nations, just half receive appropriate care, but in developing countries, close to 90 percent go untreated because psychiatrists are in such short supply. Vikram Patel outlines a highly promising approach -- training members of communities to give mental health interventions, empowering ordinary people to care for others." />

											I want you to imagine this for a moment.
											Two men, Rahul and Rajiv,
											living in the same neighborhood,
											from the same educational background, similar occupation,
											and they both turn up at their local accident emergency
											complaining of acute chest pain.
											Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure,
											but Rajiv is sent home.

											What might explain the difference in the experience
											of these two nearly identical men?
											Rajiv suffers from a mental illness.
											The difference in the quality of medical care
											received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons
											why they live shorter lives
											than people without mental illness.
											Even in the best-resourced countries in the world,
											this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years.
											In the developing countries of the world, this gap
											is even larger.

											But of course, mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways
											as well. The most obvious example is suicide.
											It might surprise some of you here, as it did me,
											when I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list
											of the leading causes of death in young people
											in all countries in the world,
											including the poorest countries of the world.

									<p>
											But beyond the impact of a health condition
											on life expectancy, we&#39;re also concerned
											about the quality of life lived.
											Now, in order for us to examine the overall impact
											of a health condition both on life expectancy
											as well as on the quality of life lived, we need to use
											a metric called the DALY,
											which stands for a Disability-Adjusted Life Year.
											Now when we do that, we discover some startling things
											about mental illness from a global perspective.
											We discover that, for example, mental illnesses are
											amongst the leading causes of disability around the world.
											Depression, for example, is the third-leading cause
											of disability, alongside conditions such as
											diarrhea and pneumonia in children.
											When you put all the mental illnesses together,
											they account for roughly 15 percent
											of the total global burden of disease.
											Indeed, mental illnesses are also very damaging
											to people&#39;s lives, but beyond just the burden of disease,
											let us consider the absolute numbers.
											The World Health Organization estimates
											that there are nearly four to five hundred million people
											living on our tiny planet
											who are affected by a mental illness.
											Now some of you here
											look a bit astonished by that number,
											but consider for a moment the incredible diversity
											of mental illnesses, from autism and intellectual disability
											in childhood, through to depression and anxiety,
											substance misuse and psychosis in adulthood,
											all the way through to dementia in old age,
											and I&#39;m pretty sure that each and every one us
											present here today can think of at least one person,
											at least one person, who&#39;s affected by mental illness
											in our most intimate social networks.
											I see some nodding heads there.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But beyond the staggering numbers,
											what&#39;s truly important from a global health point of view,
											what&#39;s truly worrying from a global health point of view,
											is that the vast majority of these affected individuals
											do not receive the care
											that we know can transform their lives, and remember,
											we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions,
											medicines, psychological interventions,
											and social interventions, can make a vast difference.
											And yet, even in the best-resourced countries,
											for example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent
											of affected people don&#39;t receive these interventions.
											In the sorts of countries I work in,
											that so-called treatment gap
											approaches an astonishing 90 percent.
											It isn&#39;t surprising, then, that if you should speak
											to anyone affected by a mental illness,
											the chances are that you will hear stories
											of hidden suffering, shame and discrimination
											in nearly every sector of their lives.
											But perhaps most heartbreaking of all
											are the stories of the abuse
											of even the most basic human rights,
											such as the young woman shown in this image here
											that are played out every day,
											sadly, even in the very institutions that were built to care
											for people with mental illnesses, the mental hospitals.

											It&#39;s this injustice that has really driven my mission
											to try to do a little bit to transform the lives
											of people affected by mental illness, and a particularly
											critical action that I focused on is to bridge the gulf
											between the knowledge we have that can transform lives,
											the knowledge of effective treatments, and how we actually
											use that knowledge in the everyday world.
											And an especially important challenge that I&#39;ve had to face
											is the great shortage of mental health professionals,
											such as psychiatrists and psychologists,
											particularly in the developing world.

											Now I trained in medicine in India, and after that
											I chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay
											of my mother and all my family members who
											kind of thought neurosurgery would be
											a more respectable option for their brilliant son.
											Any case, I went on, I soldiered on with psychiatry,
											and found myself training in Britain in some of
											the best hospitals in this country. I was very privileged.
											I worked in a team of incredibly talented, compassionate,
											but most importantly, highly trained, specialized
											mental health professionals.

											Soon after my training, I found myself working
											first in Zimbabwe and then in India, and I was confronted
											by an altogether new reality.
											This was a reality of a world in which there were almost no
											mental health professionals at all.
											In Zimbabwe, for example, there were just about
											a dozen psychiatrists, most of whom lived and worked
											in Harare city, leaving only a couple
											to address the mental health care needs
											of nine million people living in the countryside.

											In India, I found the situation was not a lot better.
											To give you a perspective, if I had to translate
											the proportion of psychiatrists in the population
											that one might see in Britain to India,
											one might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in India.
											In reality, take a guess.
											The actual number is about 3,000,
											about two percent of that number.

											It became quickly apparent to me that I couldn&#39;t follow
											the sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in,
											one that relied heavily on specialized, expensive
											mental health professionals to provide mental health care
											in countries like India and Zimbabwe.
											I had to think out of the box about some other model

											It was then that I came across these books,
											and in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting
											in global health.
											The idea is actually quite simple. The idea is,
											when you&#39;re short of specialized health care professionals,
											use whoever is available in the community,
											train them to provide a range of health care interventions,
											and in these books I read inspiring examples,
											for example of how ordinary people had been trained
											to deliver babies,
											diagnose and treat early pneumonia, to great effect.
											And it struck me that if you could train ordinary people
											to deliver such complex health care interventions,
											then perhaps they could also do the same
											with mental health care.

											Well today, I&#39;m very pleased to report to you
											that there have been many experiments in task shifting
											in mental health care across the developing world
											over the past decade, and I want to share with you
											the findings of three particular such experiments,
											all three of which focused on depression,
											the most common of all mental illnesses.
											In rural Uganda, Paul Bolton and his colleagues,
											using villagers, demonstrated that they could deliver
											interpersonal psychotherapy for depression
											and, using a randomized control design,
											showed that 90 percent of the people receiving
											this intervention recovered as compared
											to roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages.
											Similarly, using a randomized control trial in rural Pakistan,
											Atif Rahman and his colleagues showed
											that lady health visitors, who are community maternal
											health workers in Pakistan&#39;s health care system,
											could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers
											who were depressed, again showing dramatic differences
											in the recovery rates. Roughly 75 percent of mothers
											recovered as compared to about 45 percent
											in the comparison villages.
											And in my own trial in Goa, in India, we again showed
											that lay counselors drawn from local communities
											could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions
											for depression, anxiety, leading to 70 percent
											recovery rates as compared to 50 percent
											in the comparison primary health centers.

									<p>
											Now, if I had to draw together all these different
											experiments in task shifting, and there have of course
											been many other examples, and try and identify
											what are the key lessons we can learn that makes
											for a successful task shifting operation,
											I have coined this particular acronym, SUNDAR.
											What SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is &quot;attractive.&quot;
											It seems to me that there are five key lessons
											that I&#39;ve shown on this slide that are critically important
											for effective task shifting.
											The first is that we need to simplify the message
											that we&#39;re using, stripping away all the jargon
											that medicine has invented around itself.
											We need to unpack complex health care interventions
											into smaller components that can be more easily
											transferred to less-trained individuals.
											We need to deliver health care, not in large institutions,
											but close to people&#39;s homes, and we need to deliver
											health care using whoever is available and affordable
											in our local communities.
											And importantly, we need to reallocate the few specialists
											who are available to perform roles
											such as capacity-building and supervision.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now for me, task shifting is an idea
											with truly global significance,
											because even though it has arisen out of the
											situation of the lack of resources that you find
											in developing countries, I think it has a lot of significance
											for better-resourced countries as well. Why is that?
											Well, in part, because health care in the developed world,
											the health care costs in the [developed] world,
											are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk
											of those costs are human resource costs.
											But equally important is because health care has become
											so incredibly professionalized that it&#39;s become very remote
											and removed from local communities.
											For me, what&#39;s truly sundar about the idea of task shifting,
											though, isn&#39;t that it simply makes health care
											more accessible and affordable but that
											it is also fundamentally empowering.
											It empowers ordinary people to be more effective
											in caring for the health of others in their community,
											and in doing so, to become better guardians
											of their own health. Indeed, for me, task shifting
											is the ultimate example of the democratization
											of medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power.

											Just over 30 years ago, the nations of the world assembled
											at Alma-Ata and made this iconic declaration.
											Well, I think all of you can guess
											that 12 years on, we&#39;re still nowhere near that goal.
											Still, today, armed with that knowledge
											that ordinary people in the community
											can be trained and, with sufficient supervision and support,
											can deliver a range of health care interventions effectively,
											perhaps that promise is within reach now.
											Indeed, to implement the slogan of Health for All,
											we will need to involve all
											in that particular journey,
											and in the case of mental health, in particular we would
											need to involve people who are affected by mental illness
											and their caregivers.

											like myself and people affected by mental illness
											could stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder,
											and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness

											And in closing, when you have a moment of peace or quiet
											in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards,
											spare a thought for that person you thought about
											who has a mental illness, or persons that you thought about
											who have mental illness,
											and dare to care for them. Thank you. (Applause)
