<title>Denise Herzing: Could we speak the language of dolphins? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For 28 years, Denise Herzing has spent five months each summer living with a pod of Atlantic spotted dolphins, following three generations of family relationships and behaviors. It&#39;s clear they are communicating with one another -- but is it language? Could humans use it too? She shares a fascinating new experiment to test this idea." />

											Well, now we&#39;re going to the Bahamas to meet
											a remarkable group of dolphins that I&#39;ve been working with
											in the wild for the last 28 years.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now I&#39;m interested in dolphins because of their large brains
											and what they might be doing with all that brainpower
											in the wild.
											And we know they use some of that brainpower
											for just living complicated lives,
											but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, we know a few things.
											We know that their brain-to-body ratio,
											which is a physical measure of intelligence,
											is second only to humans.
											Cognitively, they can understand
											artificially-created languages.
											And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors.
											And in some parts of the world, they use tools,
											like sponges to hunt fish.
											But there&#39;s one big question left:
											do they have a language, and if so,
											what are they talking about?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So decades ago, not years ago,
											I set out to find a place in the world
											where I could observe dolphins underwater
											to try to crack the code of their communication system.
											Now in most parts of the world, the water&#39;s pretty murky,
											so it&#39;s very hard to observe animals underwater,
											but I found a community of dolphins that live
											in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas
											which are just east of Florida.
											And they spend their daytime resting and socializing
											in the safety of the shallows, but at night,
											they go off the edge and hunt in deep water.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, it&#39;s not a bad place to be a researcher, either.
											So we go out for about five months every summer
											in a 20-meter catamaran, and we live, sleep and work
											at sea for weeks at a time.
											My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone,
											which is an underwater microphone, and this is so
											I can correlate sound and behavior.
											And most of our work&#39;s pretty non-invasive.
											We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we&#39;re in the water,
											since we&#39;re actually observing them physically in the water.
											Now, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species
											to work with for a couple of reasons.
											They&#39;re born without spots, and they get spots with age,
											and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases,
											so that&#39;s fun to track their behavior.
											And by about the age of 15, they&#39;re fully spotted black and white.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the mother you see here is Mugsy.
											She&#39;s 35 years old in this shot,
											but dolphins can actually live into their early 50s.
											And like all the dolphins in our community,
											we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots
											and nicks in her dorsal fin,
											and also the unique spot patterns
											as she matured over time.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, young dolphins learn a lot as they&#39;re growing up,
											and they use their teenage years to practice social skills,
											and at about the age of nine, the females
											become sexually mature, so they can get pregnant,
											and the males mature quite a bit later,
											at around 15 years of age.
											And dolphins are very promiscuous,
											and so we have to determine who the fathers are,
											so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material
											out of the water and extracting DNA.
											So what that means is, after 28 years,
											we are tracking three generations,
											including grandmothers and grandfathers.
											Now, dolphins are natural acousticians.
											They make sounds 10 times as high
											and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do.
											But they have other communication signals they use.
											They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate.
											They have taste, not smell.
											And they have touch.
											And sound can actually be felt in the water,
											because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water&#39;s about the same.
											So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance.

											Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used
											with certain behaviors.
											Now, the signature whistle is a whistle
											that&#39;s specific to an individual dolphin, and it&#39;s like a name. (Dolphin whistling noises)
											And this is the best-studied sound,
											because it&#39;s easy to measure, really,
											and you&#39;d find this whistle when mothers and calves
											are reuniting, for example.

									<p>
											Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks.
											This is the dolphin&#39;s sonar. (Dolphin echolocation noises)
											And they use these clicks to hunt and feed.
											But they can also tightly pack these clicks together
											into buzzes and use them socially.
											For example, males will stimulate a female
											during a courtship chase.
											You know, I&#39;ve been buzzed in the water.
											(Laughter)
											Don&#39;t tell anyone. It&#39;s a secret.
											And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So dolphins are also political animals,
											so they have to resolve conflicts.
											(Dolphin noises)
											And they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as
											their head-to-head behaviors when they&#39;re fighting.
											And these are very unstudied sounds
											because they&#39;re hard to measure.

											Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight.
											(Dolphin noises)
											So you&#39;re going to see two groups,
											and you&#39;re going to see the head-to-head posturing,
											some open mouths,
											lots of squawking.
											There&#39;s a bubble.
											And basically, one of these groups will kind of back off
											and everything will resolve fine,
											and it doesn&#39;t really escalate into violence too much.

											Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose
											that interact socially with the spotted dolphins.
											For example, they babysit each other&#39;s calves.
											The males have dominance displays that they use
											when they&#39;re chasing each other&#39;s females.
											And the two species actually form temporary alliances
											when they&#39;re chasing sharks away.
											And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate
											their coordination is synchrony.
											They synchronize their sounds and their body postures
											to look bigger and sound stronger.
											(Dolphins noises)
											Now, these are bottlenose dolphins,
											and you&#39;ll see them starting to synchronize
											their behavior and their sounds.
											(Dolphin noises)
											You see, they&#39;re synchronizing with their partner
											as well as the other dyad.
											I wish I was that coordinated.

											Now, it&#39;s important to remember that you&#39;re only hearing
											the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds,
											and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds,
											and we use special equipment in the water
											to collect these sounds.
											Now, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity
											using information theory,
											and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.
											But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery.

											Now, these are three spectragrams.
											Two are human words, and one is a dolphin vocalizing.

											a bit like human phonemes.

											Now, one way to crack the code
											is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean,
											but it&#39;s a difficult job, and we actually don&#39;t have a Rosetta Stone yet.
											But a second way to crack the code
											is to develop some technology,
											an interface to do two-way communication,
											and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been trying to do in the Bahamas
											and in real time.
											Now, scientists have used keyboard interfaces
											to try to bridge the gap with species
											including chimpanzees and dolphins.
											This underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida,
											at the Epcot Center, was actually
											the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed
											for humans and dolphins to work together under the water
											and exchange information.
											So we wanted to develop an interface like this
											in the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.
											And one of the reasons we thought we could do this
											is because the dolphins were starting to show us
											a lot of mutual curiosity.
											They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations
											and our postures, and they were also inviting us
											into dolphin games.
											Now, dolphins are social mammals, so they love to play,
											and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed,
											or sargassum in this case, around.
											And they&#39;re very adept. They like to drag it
											and drop it from appendage to appendage.
											Now in this footage, the adult is Caroh.
											She&#39;s 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt,
											and he&#39;s just learning how to play this game.
											(Dolphin noises)
											She&#39;s kind of teasing him and taunting him.
											He really wants that sargassum.
											Now, when dolphins solicit humans for this game,
											they&#39;ll often sink vertically in the water,
											and they&#39;ll have a little sargassum on their flipper,
											and they&#39;ll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes
											on the bottom and let us go get it,
											and then we&#39;ll have a little seaweed keep away game.
											But when we don&#39;t dive down and get it,
											they&#39;ll bring it to the surface
											and they&#39;ll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail
											and drop it for us like they do their calves,
											and then we&#39;ll pick it up and have a game.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so we started thinking, well, wouldn&#39;t it be neat
											to build some technology that would allow the dolphins
											to request these things in real time, their favorite toys?
											So the original vision was to have a keyboard
											hanging from the boat attached to a computer,
											and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys
											on the keypad and happily exchange information
											and request toys from each other.
											But we quickly found out that dolphins simply
											were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard.
											They&#39;ve got better things to do in the wild.
											They might do it in captivity, but in the wild —

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water,
											and we labeled four objects they like to play with,
											the scarf, rope, sargassum, and also had a bow ride,
											which is a fun activity for a dolphin. (Whistle)
											And that&#39;s the scarf whistle,
											which is also associated with a visual symbol.
											And these are artificially created whistles.
											They&#39;re outside the dolphin&#39;s normal repertoire,
											but they&#39;re easily mimicked by the dolphins.
											And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour,
											working out in the field with this keyboard
											using it with each other to do requests for toys
											while the dolphins were watching.
											And the dolphins could get in on the game.
											They could point at the visual object,
											or they could mimic the whistle.

											Now this is video of a session.
											The diver here has a rope toy,
											and I&#39;m on the keyboard on the left,
											and I&#39;ve just played the rope key,
											and that&#39;s the request for the toy from the human.
											So I&#39;ve got the rope, I&#39;m diving down,
											and I&#39;m basically trying to get the dolphin&#39;s attention,
											because they&#39;re kind of like little kids.
											You have to keep their attention.
											I&#39;m going to drop the rope, see if they come over.
											Here they come,
											and then they&#39;re going to pick up the rope
											and drag it around as a toy.
											Now, I&#39;m at the keyboard on the left,
											and this is actually the first time that we tried this.
											I&#39;m going to try to request this toy, the rope toy,
											from the dolphins using the rope sound.
											Let&#39;s see if they might actually understand what that means.
											(Whistle)
											That&#39;s the rope whistle.
											Up come the dolphins,
											and drop off the rope, yay. Wow.

									<p>
											So this is only once.
											We don&#39;t know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.
											Okay, so here&#39;s a second toy in the water.
											This is a scarf toy, and I&#39;m trying to lead the dolphin
											over to the keyboard to show her
											the visual and the acoustic signal.
											Now this dolphin, we call her &quot;the scarf thief,&quot;
											because over the years she&#39;s absconded
											with about 12 scarves.
											In fact, we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas.
											So I&#39;m reaching over. She&#39;s got the scarf on her right side.
											And we try to not touch the animals too much,
											we really don&#39;t want to over-habituate them.
											And I&#39;m trying to lead her back to the keyboard.
											And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound
											to request the scarf.
											So I try to give her the scarf.
											Whoop. Almost lost it.
											But this is the moment where everything becomes possible.
											The dolphin&#39;s at the keyboard.
											You&#39;ve got full attention.
											And this sometimes went on for hours.
											And I wanted to share this video with you
											not to show you any big breakthroughs,
											because they haven&#39;t happened yet,
											but to show you the level of intention and focus
											that these dolphins have, and interest in the system.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And because of this, we really decided we needed
											some more sophisticated technology.
											So we joined forces with Georgia Tech,
											with Thad Starner&#39;s wearable computing group,
											to build us an underwater wearable computer
											that we&#39;re calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry]
											Now, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water,
											the diver&#39;s wearing the complete system, and it&#39;s acoustic only,
											so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad
											on the forearm,
											the sounds go out through an underwater speaker,
											if a dolphin mimics the whistle
											or a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in
											and are localized by two hydrophones.
											The computer can localize who requested the toy
											if there&#39;s a word match.
											And the real power of the system is in the real-time
											sound recognition, so we can respond to the dolphins
											quickly and accurately.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And we&#39;re at prototype stage, but this is how we hope it will play out.
											So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer
											and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle,
											the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water,
											but also as a word through bone conduction.
											So Diver A plays the scarf whistle
											or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle
											to request a toy from whoever has it.
											What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle,
											and if Diver A has the sargassum, if that&#39;s the sound
											that was played and requested,
											then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin
											and they&#39;ll swim away happily into the sunset
											playing sargassum for forever.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, how far can this kind of communication go?
											Well, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins
											to request things from us.
											It&#39;s designed to really be two-way.
											Now, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?
											We hope so and we think so.
											But as we decode their natural sounds,
											we&#39;re also planning to put those back into the computerized system.
											For example, right now we can put their own signature whistles
											in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin.
											Likewise, we can create our own whistles,
											our own whistle names, and let the dolphins
											request specific divers to interact with.

											Now it may be that all our mobile technology
											will actually be the same technology that helps us
											communicate with another species down the road.
											In the case of a dolphin, you know, it&#39;s a species that,
											well, they&#39;re probably close to our intelligence in many ways
											and we might not be able to admit that right now,
											but they live in quite a different environment,
