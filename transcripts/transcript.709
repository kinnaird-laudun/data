<title>Lewis Pugh: My mind-shifting Everest swim | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: After he swam the North Pole, Lewis Pugh vowed never to take another cold-water dip. Then he heard of Lake Imja in the Himalayas, created by recent glacial melting, and Lake Pumori, a body of water at an altitude of 5300 m on Everest -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change." />

											Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim
											which I did across the North Pole.
											And while that swim took place three years ago,
											I can remember it as if it was yesterday.
											I remember standing on the edge of the ice,
											about to dive into the water,
											and thinking to myself, I have never ever
											seen any place on this earth
											which is just so frightening.
											The water is completely black.
											The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade,
											or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.
											It&#39;s flipping freezing in that water.
											And then a thought came across my mind:
											if things go pear-shaped on this swim,
											how long will it take for my frozen body
											to sink the four and a half kilometers
											to the bottom of the ocean?
											And then I said to myself, I&#39;ve just got to get this thought
											out of my mind as quickly as possible.
											And the only way I can dive
											into that freezing cold water
											and swim a kilometer
											is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up,
											listening to everything from beautiful opera
											all the way across to Puff Daddy,
											and then committing myself a hundred percent —
											there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind —
											and then walking up to the edge of the ice
											and just diving into the water.

									<p>
											And that swim took me
											18 minutes and 50 seconds,
											and it felt like 18 days.
											And I remember getting out of the water
											and my hands feeling so painful
											and looking down at my fingers,
											and my fingers were literally the size of sausages
											because — you know, we&#39;re made partially of water —
											when water freezes it expands,
											and so the cells in my fingers
											had frozen and expanded
											and burst.
											And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water
											was the following:
											I&#39;m never, ever
											going to do another cold water swim
											in my life again.

											Anyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas
											and the melting of the — (Laughter)
											and the melting of the glaciers
											because of climate change.
											I heard about this lake, Lake Imja.
											This lake has been formed in the last couple of years
											because of the melting of the glacier.
											The glacier&#39;s gone all the way up the mountain
											and left in its place this big lake.
											And I firmly believe
											that what we&#39;re seeing in the Himalayas
											is the next great, big battleground
											on this earth.
											Nearly two billion people —
											so one in three people on this earth —
											rely on the water from the Himalayas.
											And with a population increasing as quickly as it is,
											and with the water supply from these glaciers —
											because of climate change —
											decreasing so much,
											I think we have a real risk of instability.
											North, you&#39;ve got China; south, you&#39;ve India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
											all these countries.

											And so I decided
											to walk up to Mt. Everest,
											the highest mountain on this earth,
											and go and do a symbolic swim
											underneath the summit
											of Mt. Everest.
											Now, I don&#39;t know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest,
											but it&#39;s quite an ordeal getting up there.
											28 great, big, powerful yaks
											carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain —
											I don&#39;t just have my Speedo,
											but there&#39;s a big film crew who then
											send all the images around the world.
											The other thing which was so challenging about this swim
											is not just the altitude.
											I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.
											So it&#39;s right up in the heavens.
											It&#39;s very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.
											I feels like you&#39;ve got a man standing behind you with a hammer
											just hitting your head all the time.

											That&#39;s not the worst part of it.
											The worst part was this year was the year where they decided
											to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.
											Many, many people have died on Mt. Everest,
											and this was the year they decided to go
											and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers
											and then bring them down the mountain.
											And when you&#39;re walking up the mountain
											to attempt to do something
											which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish —
											there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters —
											When you&#39;re trying to do that,
											and then the bodies are coming past you,
											it humbles you,
											and you also realize very, very clearly
											that nature is so much more powerful
											than we are.

											And we walked up this pathway,
											all the way up.
											And to the right hand side of us
											was this great Khumbu Glacier.
											And all the way along the glacier we saw
											these big pools of melting ice.
											And then we got up to this small lake
											underneath the summit of Mt. Everest,
											and I prepared myself
											the same way as I&#39;ve always prepared myself,
											for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.
											I put on my iPod, I listened to some music,
											I got myself as aggressive as possible —
											but controlled aggression —
											and then I hurled myself
											into that water.

											I swam as quickly as I could
											for the first hundred meters,
											and then I realized very, very quickly,
											I had a huge problem on my hands.
											I could barely breathe.
											I was gasping for air.
											I then began to choke,
											and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.
											And it all happened so quickly:
											I then — I don&#39;t know how it happened — but I went underwater.
											And luckily, the water was quite shallow,
											and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake
											and get up and then take another gasp of air.
											And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.
											I carried on for another five or six strokes,
											and then I had nothing in my body,
											and I went down to the bottom of the lake.
											And I don&#39;t where I got it from,
											but I was able to somehow
											pull myself up and as quickly as possible
											get to the side of the lake.
											I&#39;ve heard it said that drowning
											is the most peaceful death that you can have.
											I have never, ever heard
											such utter bollocks.
											(Laughter)
											It is the most frightening and panicky feeling
											that you can have.

											I got myself to the side of the lake.
											My crew grabbed me,
											and then we walked as quickly as we could
											down — over the rubble —
											down to our camp.
											And there, we sat down,
											and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong
											there on Mt. Everest.
											And my team just gave it to me straight.
											They said, Lewis, you need to have
											a radical tactical shift
											if you want to do this swim.
											Every single thing which you have learned
											in the past 23 years of swimming,
											you must forget.
											Every single thing which you learned
											when you were serving in the British army,
											about speed and aggression,
											you put that to one side.
											We want you to walk up the hill in another two days&#39; time.
											Take some time to rest and think about things.
											We want you to walk up the mountain in two days&#39; time,
											and instead of swimming fast,
											swim as slowly as possible.
											Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.
											And remember, never ever swim with aggression.
											This is the time to swim
											with real humility.

									<p>
											And so we walked back up
											to the mountain two days later.
											And I stood there
											on the edge of the lake,
											and I looked up at Mt. Everest —
											and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth —
											and I said to myself, just do this slowly.
											And I swam across the lake.
											And I can&#39;t begin to tell you
											how good I felt
											when I came to the other side.

									<p>
											But I learned two very, very
											important lessons there on Mt. Everest,
											and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.
											The first one is
											that just because something has worked in the past so well,
											doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to work in the future.
											And similarly,
											now, before I do anything,
											I ask myself what type of mindset
											do I require
											to successfully complete a task.
											And taking that into the world of climate change —
											which is, frankly,
											the Mt. Everest of all problems —
											just because we&#39;ve lived the way we have lived for so long,
											just because we have consumed the way we have for so long
											and populated the earth the way we have for so long,
											doesn&#39;t mean that we can carry on
											the way we are carrying on.
											The warning signs are all there.
											When I was born, the world&#39;s population
											was 3.5 billion people.
											We&#39;re now 6.8 billion people,
											and we&#39;re expected to be 9 billion people
											by 2050.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then the second lesson,
											the radical, tactical shift.
											And I&#39;ve come here to ask you today:
											what radical tactical shift
											can you take in your relationship to the environment,
											which will ensure
											that our children and our grandchildren
											live in a safe world
											and a secure world,
											and most importantly, in a sustainable world?
											And I ask you, please, to go away from here
											and think about that one
											radical tactical shift
											which you could make,
											which will make that big difference,
											and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.
											Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it,
											and commit a hundred percent,
											because very, very few things
											are impossible to achieve
											if we really put our whole minds to it.

He's just back from swimming in a meltwater lake on the slopes of Mount Everest. ","whylisten":"<p>Lewis Gordon Pugh loves to pioneer new swimming routes around or between landmarks once thought unswimmable. In 2006, he swam the drought-stricken Thames; also that year he became the first swimmer to do a long-distance swim in all five oceans of the world. The following year, he made the first long-distance swim across the North Pole -- where climate change made the ice temporarily disappear. Heading into the second decade of his swimming career, he&#39;s regarded as the greatest cold-water swimmer in history. <br /><br />His swims have given him a sea-level view of our planet, and inspired him to do his bit to help preserve it. He left a career in maritime law to become a public speaker on environmental issues with his group, Polar Defence Project -- and of course to plan more astonishing swims and treks. In September 2008, Pugh and Robbie Hedgus kayaked across the Arctic Ocean into the polar ice pack, to raise awareness of the thinning sea ice and the dangers of climate change in the Arctic and across the world. And at the end of May 2010 he swam 1 kilometer across Pumori, a meltwater lake situated next to the Khumbu Glacier on Mount Everest, at an altitude of 5300 meters, to draw attention to the melting of the Asian glaciers. He completed the swim -- the highest any person has undertaken -- in less than 23 minutes. &quot;Glaciers are not just ice: they are a lifeline, they provide water to 2 billion people, and we need to protect them,&quot; he says. </p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/lewis_pugh_s_mind_shifting_mt_everest_swim","viewed_count":1058275,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"After he swam the North Pole, Lewis Pugh vowed never to take another cold-water dip.

goals.","whotheyare":"Pushing his body through epic cold-water swims, Lewis Gordon Pugh wants to draw attention to our global climate. He's just back from swimming in a meltwater lake on the slopes of Mount Everest. ","whylisten":"<p>Lewis Gordon Pugh loves to pioneer new swimming routes around or between landmarks once thought unswimmable. In 2006, he swam the drought-stricken Thames; also that year he became the first swimmer to do a long-distance swim in all five oceans of the world. The following year, he made the first long-distance swim across the North Pole -- where climate change made the ice temporarily disappear. Heading into the second decade of his swimming career, he&#39;s regarded as the greatest cold-water swimmer in history. <br /><br />His swims have given him a sea-level view of our planet, and inspired him to do his bit to help preserve it. He left a career in maritime law to become a public speaker on environmental issues with his group, Polar Defence Project -- and of course to plan more astonishing swims and treks. In September 2008, Pugh and Robbie Hedgus kayaked across the Arctic Ocean into the polar ice pack, to raise awareness of the thinning sea ice and the dangers of climate change in the Arctic and across the world. And at the end of May 2010 he swam 1 kilometer across Pumori, a meltwater lake situated next to the Khumbu Glacier on Mount Everest, at an altitude of 5300 meters, to draw attention to the melting of the Asian glaciers. He completed the swim -- the highest any person has undertaken -- in less than 23 minutes. &quot;Glaciers are not just ice: they are a lifeline, they provide water to 2 billion people, and we need to protect them,&quot; he says. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Lewis Pugh","tags":["activism","adventure","climate change","global issues","science","sports"],"title":"My mind-shifting Everest swim","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1058275}]}
