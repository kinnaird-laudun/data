<title>Thordis Elva and Tom Stranger: Our story of rape and reconciliation | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 1996, Thordis Elva shared a teenage romance with Tom Stranger, an exchange student from Australia. After a school dance, Tom raped Thordis, after which they parted ways for many years. In this extraordinary talk, Elva and Stranger move through a years-long chronology of shame and silence, and invite us to discuss the omnipresent global issue of sexual violence in a new, honest way.

											Tom Stranger: In 1996,
when I was 18 years old,
											I had the golden opportunity to go
on an international exchange program.
											Ironically I&#39;m an Australian
who prefers proper icy cold weather,
											so I was both excited and tearful
when I got on a plane to Iceland,
											after just having farewelled
my parents and brothers goodbye.
											I was welcomed into the home
of a beautiful Icelandic family
											who took me hiking,
											and helped me get a grasp
of the melodic Icelandic language.
											I struggled a bit with the initial
period of homesickness.
											I snowboarded after school,
											and I slept a lot.
											Two hours of chemistry class in a language
that you don&#39;t yet fully understand
											can be a pretty good sedative.

											My teacher recommended
I try out for the school play,
											just to get me a bit more socially active.
											It turns out I didn&#39;t end up
being part of the play,
											but through it I met Thordis.
											We shared a lovely teenage romance,
											and we&#39;d meet at lunchtimes
to just hold hands
											and walk around old downtown Reykjavík.
											I met her welcoming family,
and she met my friends.
											We&#39;d been in a budding relationship
for a bit over a month
											when our school&#39;s Christmas Ball was held.

											Thordis Elva: I was 16
and in love for the first time.
											Going together to the Christmas dance
											was a public confirmation
of our relationship,
											and I felt like the luckiest
girl in the world.
											No longer a child, but a young woman.
											High on my newfound maturity,
											I felt it was only natural to try drinking
rum for the first time that night, too.
											That was a bad idea.
											I became very ill,
											drifting in and out of consciousness
											in between spasms of convulsive vomiting.
											The security guards wanted
to call me an ambulance,
											but Tom acted as my knight
in shining armor,
											and told them he&#39;d take me home.

											It was like a fairy tale,
											his strong arms around me,
											laying me in the safety of my bed.
											But the gratitude that I felt
towards him soon turned to horror
											as he proceeded to take off my clothes
and get on top of me.
											My head had cleared up,
											but my body was still
too weak to fight back,
											and the pain was blinding.
											I thought I&#39;d be severed in two.
											In order to stay sane,
											I silently counted the seconds
on my alarm clock.

where girls are taught

											One day, I stormed out
of the door in tears

											I always had a notebook with me,
											claiming that it was to jot down ideas
in moments of inspiration,

to be constantly fidgeting,

											I found myself counting seconds again.

as the words streamed out of my pen,
											forming the most pivotal letter
I&#39;ve ever written,
											addressed to Tom.
											Along with an account of the violence
that he subjected me to,
											the words, &quot;I want to find forgiveness&quot;
											stared back at me,
											surprising nobody more than myself.
											But deep down I realized that this
was my way out of my suffering,

that I didn&#39;t prepare myself for

											a typed confession from Tom,
full of disarming regret.

had been imprisoned by silence.

of an eight-year-long correspondence
											that God knows was never easy,
											but always honest.

that I&#39;d wrongfully shouldered,

are geographically like this.

a stunningly powerful environment

and forgiveness.

and rapprochement been tested

were spoken aloud and felt,
