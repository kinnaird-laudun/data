<title>Simon Berrow: How do you save a shark you know nothing about? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: They&#39;re the second-largest fish in the world, they&#39;re almost extinct, and we know almost nothing about them. In this talk, Simon Berrow describes the fascinating basking shark (&quot;great fish of the sun&quot; in Irish), and the exceptional -- and wonderfully low-tech -- ways he&#39;s learning enough to save them." />

											Basking sharks are awesome creatures.
											They are just magnificent.
											They grow 10 meters long; some say bigger.
											They might weigh up to two tons.
											Some say up to five tons.
											They&#39;re the second-largest
fish in the world.
											They&#39;re also harmless
plankton-feeding animals.
											And they are thought to be able to filter
a cubic kilometer of water every hour
											and can feed on 30 kilos
of zoo plankton a day to survive.
											They&#39;re fantastic creatures.
											We&#39;re very lucky in Ireland,
											we have plenty of basking sharks
and plenty of opportunities to study them.

											They were very important
to coastal communities,
											going back hundreds of years,
											especially around
the Claddaghduff, Connemara region
											where subsistence farmers used to sail
out on their hookers and open boats,
											sometimes way offshore
to a place called the Sunfish Bank,
											about 30 miles west of Achill Island,
											to kill the basking sharks.
											This is a woodcut from about the 1800s.

											They were very important,
for the oil out of their liver.
											A third of the basking
shark&#39;s size is their liver,
											and it&#39;s full of oil, gallons of oil.
											That oil was used especially for lighting,
											but also for dressing wounds
and other things.
											In fact, the streetlights in 1742,
											of Galway, Dublin and Waterford,
											were lit with sunfish oil.
											&quot;Sunfish&quot; is one of the words
for basking sharks.
											So they were incredibly important animals.
											They&#39;ve been around a long time,
very important to coastal communities.

											Probably the best-documented
basking shark fishery in the world
											is that from Achill Island.
											This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
											Sharks used to come into the bay,
											and the fishermen
would tie a net off the headland,
											string it out, an old Manila net,
											and as the shark came round,
it would hit the net,
											the net would collapse on it.
											It would often drown and suffocate.
											Or at times, they would row out
in their small curraghs
											and kill it with a lance
through the back of the neck.
											And then they&#39;d tow the sharks
back to Purteen Harbour,
											boil them up, use the oil.
											They also used the flesh
as well, for fertilizer
											and also would fin the sharks.
											This is probably the biggest threat
to sharks worldwide —
											the finning of sharks.

											We&#39;re often frightened
of sharks, thanks to &quot;Jaws.&quot;
											Maybe five or six people
get killed by sharks every year.
											There was someone recently, wasn&#39;t there?
Just a couple weeks ago.
											We kill about 100 million sharks a year.
											So I don&#39;t know what the balance is,
											but I think sharks have more right
to be fearful of us than we have of them.
											It was a well-documented fishery.
											As you can see here,
it peaked in the &#39;50s,
											where they were killing
1,500 sharks a year.
											And it declined very fast —
a classic boom-and-bust fishery,
											which suggests that a stock
has been depleted
											or there&#39;s low reproductive rates.
											They killed about 12,000 sharks
within this period,
											literally just by stringing a Manila rope
											off the tip of Keem Bay
up in Achill Island.

up into the mid-80s,

											The importance of basking sharks
to the coast communities
											is recognized through the language.
											I don&#39;t pretend
to [know many Irish words],

known as &quot;ainmhide Na seolta,&quot;
											&quot;the monster with the sails.&quot;
											Another title would be &quot;liop an dá lapa,&quot;
											&quot;the unwieldy beast with two fins.&quot;

											Or my favorite, &quot;liabhán chor gréine,&quot;

											It&#39;s been suggested

											What we&#39;ve been doing for a couple
years — last year was a big year —
											is we started tagging sharks,
											so we could try to get some idea
of sight fidelity and movement
											and things like that.
											So we concentrated mainly
in North Donegal and West Kerry
											as the two areas
where I was mainly active.
											And we tagged them
very simply, not very high-tech,
											with a big, long pole.
											This is a beachcaster rod
with a tag on the end.
											You go up in your boat and tag the shark.
											And we were very effective.
											We tagged 105 sharks last summer.

											Half the challenge to get access
											is to be in the right place
at the right time.
											But it&#39;s a very simple, easy technique;
I&#39;ll show you what it looks like.
											We use a pole camera on the boat
to actually film the shark.
											One, it&#39;s to try and work out
the gender of the shark.
											We also deployed some satellite tags,
so we did use high-tech stuff as well.
											These are archival tags.
											What they do is store the data.
											A satellite tag only works
when the air is clear of the water
											and can send a signal to the satellite.
											And sharks and fish
are underwater most of the time,
											so this tag actually works out
the locations of shark,
											depending on the timing
and the setting of the sun,
											plus water temperature and depth.
											And you have to kind of
reconstruct the path.

											What happens is,
											you set the tag to detach
from the shark after a fixed period —

											and literally to the day,
the tag popped off,
											drifted up, said hello to the satellite
											and sent, not all the data,
but enough data for us to use.
											This is the only way to really work out
their behavior and movements
											when they&#39;re underwater.

on the shelf edge.

spent most of its time

											So very simple things like that,
											we&#39;re trying to learn
about basking sharks.
											One thing that I think
is a very surprising and strange thing
											is just how low the genetic
diversity of sharks is.
											I&#39;m not a geneticist, so I won&#39;t pretend
to understand the genetics.
											And that&#39;s why it&#39;s great
to have collaboration.
											Whereas I&#39;m a field person,
											I get panic attacks
											if I have to spend too many hours
in a lab with a white coat on.
											Take me away.
											So we can work with geneticists
who understand that.
											So when they looked at
the genetics of basking sharks,
											they found that the diversity
was incredibly low.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											If you look at the first line, really,
											you can see that all these different
shark species are all quite similar.
											I think this means they&#39;re all sharks
											and they&#39;ve come from a common ancestry.
											But if you look at nucleotide diversity,
											which is more genetics
that are passed on through the parents,
											you see that basking sharks,
if you look at the first study,
											was order of magnitude less diverse
even than other shark species.
											You can see this work
was only done in 2006.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Before 2006, we had no idea of the genetic
variability of basking sharks.
											We had no idea: Did they distinguish
into different populations?
											Were there subpopulations?
											And that&#39;s very important
if you want to know
											what the population size is,
and the status of the animals.
											So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found
this a bit unbelievable, really.
											So he did another study
using microsatellites,
											which is much more expensive,
much more time-consuming,
											and to his surprise,
came up with almost identical results.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So it does seem to be
that basking sharks, for some reason,
											have incredibly low diversity.
											And it&#39;s thought maybe
it was a genetic bottleneck,
											thought to have been 12,000 years ago,
											and this has caused a very low diversity.
											And yet, if you look at the whale shark,
											which is the other
plankton-eating large shark,
											its diversity is much greater.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So it doesn&#39;t really make sense at all.
											They found that there was
no genetic differentiation
											between any of the world&#39;s oceans
of basking sharks:
											even though they&#39;re found
throughout the world,
											you couldn&#39;t tell
the difference, genetically,
											from one from the Pacific, Atlantic,
New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa.
											They all basically seem the same.
											Which, again, is kind of surprising;
you wouldn&#39;t expect that.
											I don&#39;t understand or pretend
to understand this;
											I suspect most geneticists don&#39;t either,
											but they produce the numbers.

									<p>
											So you can actually estimate
the population size
											based on the diversity of the genetics.
											And Rus Hoelzel came up with
an effective population size:
											8,200 animals.
											That&#39;s it — 8,000 animals in the world.
											You&#39;re thinking,
&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous. No way.&quot;
											So Les did a finer study,
											and he found out it came out about 9,000.
											Using different microsatellites
gave the different results,
											but the mean of all these
studies is about 5,000,
											which I personally don&#39;t believe.
											But then, I am a skeptic.
											But even if you toss a few numbers around,
											you&#39;re probably talking an effective
population of about 20,000 animals.
											Do you remember how many they killed
off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?
											So what it tells us, actually,
											is that there&#39;s actually a risk
of extinction of this species
											because its population is so small.
											In fact, of those 20,000,
											8,000 were thought to be females.
											There&#39;s only 8,000 basking shark
females in the world?
											I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t believe it.

											The problem with this
is they were constrained with samples.
											They didn&#39;t get enough samples
											to really explore the genetics
in enough detail.
											So, where do you get samples from
for your genetic analysis?
											Well, one obvious source is dead sharks —
											dead sharks, washed up.
											We might get two or three dead sharks
washed up in Ireland a year,
											if we&#39;re kind of lucky.
											Another source would be
fisheries&#39; bycatch.
											We were getting quite a few caught
in surface drift nets.
											That&#39;s banned now, and that&#39;ll be
good news for the sharks.
											And some are caught in nets, in trawls.
											This is a shark that was actually
landed in Howth just before Christmas —
											illegally, because you&#39;re not allowed
to do that under EU law —
											and was actually sold
for eight euros a kilo as shark steak.
											They even put a recipe up on the wall,
											until they were told it was illegal.
											They actually did get a fine for that.

											When we were out tagging our sharks —
											this is how we tagged them on the front
of a RIB, get in there fast —
											occasionally, the sharks do react.
											On one occasion, when we were
up in Malin Head in Donegal,
											the shark smacked the side
of the boat with his tail,
											more, I think, in startle to the fact
that a boat came near it,
											rather than the tag going in.
											And that was fine. We got wet. No problem.
											And then when myself and Emmett
got back to Malin Head, to the pier,
											I noticed some black slime
on the front of the boat.
											I used to spend a lot of time
on commercial fishing boats,
											and I remember fishermen saying
											they can tell when a basking shark
has been caught in a net,

a conference on the Isle of Man.

to look at my slime?&quot;

											We got more money this year
											to carry on collecting
more and more samples.
											One thing that is very useful
is that we use a pole camera —
											this is my colleague, Joanne,
with a pole camera —
											where you can look underneath the shark.
											What you&#39;re trying to look at is,
the males have claspers,
											which kind of dangle out
behind the back of the shark.
											So you can quite easily tell
the gender of the shark.
											If we can tell the gender of the shark
before we sample it,
											we can tell the geneticist
this was taken from a male or a female.
											Because in the moment,
they have no way, genetically,
											of telling the difference
between a male and a female,
											which I find staggering,
											because they don&#39;t know
what primers to look for.
											Being able to tell the gender of a shark
											is very important
for things like policing the trade

to trade in these sharks.
