<title>Bryan Stevenson: We need to talk about an injustice | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In an engaging and personal talk -- with cameo appearances from his grandmother and Rosa Parks -- human rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson shares some hard truths about America&#39;s justice system, starting with a massive imbalance along racial lines: a third of the country&#39;s black male population has been incarcerated at some point in their lives. These issues, which are wrapped up in America&#39;s unexamined history, are rarely talked about with this level of candor, insight and persuasiveness." />

<meta content="In an engaging and personal talk — with cameo appearances from his grandmother and Rosa Parks — human rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson shares some hard truths about America's justice system, starting with a massive imbalance along racial lines: a third of the country's black male population has been incarcerated at some point in their lives. These issues, which are wrapped up in America's unexamined history, are rarely talked about with this level of candor, insight and persuasiveness." itemprop='description'>

											Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.
											I spend most of my time
											in jails, in prisons, on death row.
											I spend most of my time in very low-income communities
											in the projects and places where there&#39;s a great deal of hopelessness.
											And being here at TED
											and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,
											has been very, very energizing to me.
											And one of the things that&#39;s emerged in my short time here
											is that TED has an identity.
											And you can actually say things here
											that have impacts around the world.
											And sometimes when it comes through TED,
											it has meaning and power
											that it doesn&#39;t have when it doesn&#39;t.

											And I mention that because I think identity is really important.
											And we&#39;ve had some fantastic presentations.
											And I think what we&#39;ve learned
											is that, if you&#39;re a teacher your words can be meaningful,
											but if you&#39;re a compassionate teacher,
											they can be especially meaningful.
											If you&#39;re a doctor you can do some good things,
											but if you&#39;re a caring doctor you can do some other things.
											And so I want to talk about the power of identity.
											And I didn&#39;t learn about this actually
											practicing law and doing the work that I do.
											I actually learned about this from my grandmother.

											I grew up in a house
											that was the traditional African-American home
											that was dominated by a matriarch,
											and that matriarch was my grandmother.
											She was tough, she was strong,
											she was powerful.
											She was the end of every argument in our family.
											She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.
											She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.
											Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840&#39;s.
											She was born in the 1880&#39;s
											and the experience of slavery
											very much shaped the way she saw the world.

											And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
											When I would see her as a little boy,
											she&#39;d come up to me and she&#39;d give me these hugs.
											And she&#39;d squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe
											and then she&#39;d let me go.
											And an hour or two later, if I saw her,
											she&#39;d come over to me and she&#39;d say, &quot;Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?&quot;
											And if I said, &quot;No,&quot; she&#39;d assault me again,
											and if I said, &quot;Yes,&quot; she&#39;d leave me alone.
											And she just had this quality
											that you always wanted to be near her.
											And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.
											My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
											And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,
											it would be difficult to get her time and attention.
											My cousins would be running around everywhere.

											And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,

											and she took me by the hand
											and she said, &quot;Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk.&quot;

											and the head of the motion was: &quot;Motion to try my poor,
											14-year-old black male client
											like a privileged, white 75-year-old
											corporate executive.&quot;

											A couple months went by,
											and I had just forgotten all about it.
											And I finally decided,
											oh gosh, I&#39;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case.
											And I got into my car
											and I was feeling really overwhelmed — overwhelmed.
											And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.

											And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,
											there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
											When this man saw me, he came over to me
											and he said, &quot;Who are you?&quot;
											I said, &quot;I&#39;m a lawyer.&quot; He said, &quot;You&#39;re a lawyer?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;
											And this man came over to me

											And he whispered in my ear.
											He said, &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you.&quot;
											And I have to tell you,

											And people started coming in because they were just outraged.
											I had written these crazy things.
											And police officers were coming in

											And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people

											He kept pacing back and forth.
											And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face
											came into the courtroom and sat down behind me,
											almost at counsel table.
											About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.
											And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended
											that the janitor had come into court.
											And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
											He said, &quot;Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?&quot;
											And this older black man stood up
											and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me

											I&#39;ve come to TED
											because I believe that many of you understand
											that the moral arc of the universe is long,
											but it bends toward justice.
											That we cannot be full evolved human beings
											until we care about human rights and basic dignity.
											That all of our survival
											is tied to the survival of everyone.
											That our visions of technology and design
											and entertainment and creativity
											have to be married with visions
											of humanity, compassion and justice.
											And more than anything,
											for those of you who share that,
											I&#39;ve simply come to tell you
											to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.

											BS: Well there are opportunities all around us.
											If you live in the state of California, for example,
											there&#39;s a referendum coming up this spring
											where actually there&#39;s going to be an effort
											to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.
											For example, here in California
											we&#39;re going to spend one billion dollars
											on the death penalty in the next five years —
											one billion dollars.
											And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases
											don&#39;t result in arrest.
											56 percent of all rape cases don&#39;t result.
											So there&#39;s an opportunity to change that.
											And this referendum would propose having those dollars
											go to law enforcement and safety.
											And I think that opportunity exists all around us.

											BS: Well actually the violent crime rate
											has remained relatively stable.
											The great increase in mass incarceration in this country
											wasn&#39;t really in violent crime categories.
											It was this misguided war on drugs.
											That&#39;s where the dramatic increases have come
											in our prison population.
											And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.
											And so we have three strikes laws
											that put people in prison forever
											for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,
											rather than making them give those resources back
											to the people who they victimized.
											I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,
											not do less.
											And I think our current punishment philosophy
											does nothing for no one.
											And I think that&#39;s the orientation that we have to change.
