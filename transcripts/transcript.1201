											dozens and dozens of young people —
											if he intended to do that,
											he&#39;s a vicious criminal. We punish him.
											Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway.
											But, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy,
											if he was motivated by some random mental illness,
											he&#39;s in a completely different category.
											We may put him away for life, but
											we watch him clinically.
											It&#39;s a completely different domain.
											As an intentional murderer,

											But as a dysfunctional,
											as a dysfunctional murderer/psychotic,
											he&#39;s something much more complicated.
											He&#39;s the breath of some

											Well, got that wrong, didn&#39;t we?
											But look at that statement; it&#39;s all about intent. That&#39;s what I love about it.
											But consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing?
											It&#39;s a grand idea of design — a huge idea of design,
											common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy
											that emerged in the Classical period.
											What was going on then?
											They were trying to answer the question of
											what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive?
											As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos,
											a confrontation with random, brutal nature,
											they suddenly had a moment to think — and there was a lot to think about.
											All of a sudden, human existence needed an intent.
											Human life needed a reason.
											Reality itself needed a designer.
											The given was replaced
											by various aspects of intent,
											by various designs,
											by various gods.
											Gods we&#39;re still fighting about. Oh yeah.

											Today we don&#39;t confront the chaos of nature.

											In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s,
											I was working for ABC News, and I was reporting on
											the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire,
											who raped and pillaged that country.
											There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa.
											The place was falling apart; it was a horrible, horrible place,
											and I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa
											to report on the rioting and the looting.
											People were carrying off vehicles, carrying off pieces of buildings.
											Soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests.
											In the middle of this chaos, I&#39;m rolling around in a wheelchair,
											and I was completely invisible. Completely.
											I was in a wheelchair; I didn&#39;t look like a looter.
											I was in a wheelchair; I didn&#39;t look like a journalist, particularly, at least from their perspective.
											And I didn&#39;t look like a soldier, that&#39;s for sure.
											I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire, completely invisible.
											And all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me,
											in this metal and wood and leather
											pedal, three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device,

											We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes.
											And I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism;

											His smile, our glow
											as we talked a universal language
