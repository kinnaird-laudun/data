											standing in front of an audience is a cross between

											so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments
											by relying on words on paper,
											and I only hope I&#39;m not struck by lightning bolts before I&#39;m done.
											I&#39;d like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me

											I was a student in the &#39;60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,
											and on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism.
											The war in Vietnam was raging;
											the Civil Rights Movement was under way;
											and pictures had a powerful influence on me.
											Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing,
											and photographers were telling us another.
											I believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans.
											Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism.
											They not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history.
											Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness
											and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,
											change became not only possible, but inevitable.

											I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism,
											specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus
											both the benefits and the cost of political policies.
											It can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.
											In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction,
											it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage
											and asking us to reassess our behavior.
											It puts a human face on issues
											which from afar can appear abstract
											or ideological or monumental in their global impact.
											What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,
											happens to ordinary citizens one by one.

											And I understood that documentary photography
											has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.
											It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.
											And as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion
											and gives impetus to public debate,
											thereby preventing the interested parties
											from totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.
											Coming of age in those days made real
											the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital
											for a free and dynamic society to function properly.
											The press is certainly a business, and in order to survive
											it must be a successful business,
											but the right balance must be found
											between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.

											Society&#39;s problems can&#39;t be solved until they&#39;re identified.
											On a higher plane, the press is a service industry,
											and the service it provides is awareness.
											Every story does not have to sell something.
											There&#39;s also a time to give.
											That was a tradition I wanted to follow.
											Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved
											and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution —
											I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer.
											But I was driven by an inherent sense
											that a picture that revealed the true face of war
											would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph.

											I&#39;d like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events

											In 1981, I went to Northern Ireland.
											10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death
											in protest against conditions in jail.
											The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation.
											I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars
											are not on isolated battlefields, but right where people live.
											During the early &#39;80s, I spent a lot of time in Central America,
											which was engulfed by civil wars
											that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War.

											In Guatemala, the central government —
											controlled by a oligarchy of European decent —
											was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion,
											and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America:
											conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword.
											An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded
											as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua.
											A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza&#39;s national guard
											was left as a monument in a park in Managua,
											and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child.
											At the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador,
											and again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict.

											I&#39;ve been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981.
											This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada, in 2000,
											when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army.
											In 2001, the uprising escalated into an armed conflict,
											and one of the major incidents was
											the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp
											in the West Bank town of Jenin.

											In the &#39;90s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union,

											between Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
											This is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar,

											A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery

											At the same time in South Africa,
											after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison,
											the black population commenced the final phase
											of liberation from apartheid.
											One of the things I had to learn as a journalist
											was what to do with my anger.
											I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something
											that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it.
											In Transkei, I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood, of the Xhosa tribe.
											Teenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay.
											After several weeks, they washed off the white
											and took on the full responsibilities of men.
											It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic
											of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa.

											Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline.
											Elsewhere in Africa there was famine.
											In Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out.
											Farmers were driven off their land,
											and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen.
											Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction —
											primitive but extremely effective.
											Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated,
											slowly and painfully.
											The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief,
											and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved.
											American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments,
											but they were eventually drawn into the conflict,
											and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn.
											In southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation

											I&#39;m a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.
											I also want it to be powerful and eloquent,
											and to do as much justice as possible
											to the experience of the people I&#39;m photographing.
											This man was in an NGO feeding center,

											He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton,

											He had not given up, and if he didn&#39;t give up,
											how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope?
											In 1994, after three months of covering the South African election,

											It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer.

											international action was taken much more decisively.

											Between 1995 and &#39;96, I covered the first two wars

											After the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania

											where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions.
											Ceausescu had imposed a quota
											on the number of children to be produced by each family,
											thereby making women&#39;s bodies an instrument of state economic policy.
											Children who couldn&#39;t be supported by their families
											were raised in government orphanages.
											Children with birth defects were labeled incurables,
											and confined for life to inhuman conditions.

However, when certain stories he wanted to cover -- such as <a href=\"http://www.jamesnachtwey.com/jn/slides/g14.html\" target=\"_blank\">Romanian orphanages</a>  and <a href=\"http://www.jamesnachtwey.com/jn/slides/g26.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"famine in Somalia\">famine in Somalia</a>  -- garnered no interest from magazines, he self-financed trips there. He is known for getting up close to his subjects, or as he says, &quot;in the same intimate space that the subjects inhabit,&quot; and he passes that sense of closeness on to the viewer. <br /><br />In putting himself in the middle of conflict, his intention is to record the truth, to document the struggles of humanity, and with this, to wake people up and stir them to action.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"James Nachtwey","tags":["activism","culture","global issues","media","photography","poverty","social change","storytelling","art","war"],"title":"My wish: Let my photographs bear witness","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1336587}]}
