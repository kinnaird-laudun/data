											Type is something we consume
											in enormous quantities.
											In much of the world,
											it&#39;s completely inescapable.
											But few consumers are concerned to know
											where a particular typeface came from
											or when or who designed it,
											if, indeed, there was any human agency involved
											in its creation, if it didn&#39;t just sort of materialize
											out of the software ether.

											But I do have to be concerned with those things.
											It&#39;s my job.
											I&#39;m one of the tiny handful of people
											who gets badly bent out of shape
											by the bad spacing of the T and the E
											that you see there.
											I&#39;ve got to take that slide off.
											I can&#39;t stand it. Nor can Chris.

											So my talk is about the connection
											between technology and design of type.
											The technology has changed
											a number of times since I started work:
											photo, digital, desktop, screen, web.
											I&#39;ve had to survive those changes and try
											to understand their implications for what I do
											for design.
											This slide is about the effect of tools on form.
											The two letters, the two K&#39;s,
											the one on your left, my right, is modern,
											made on a computer.
											All straight lines are dead straight.
											The curves have that kind of
mathematical smoothness
											that the Bézier formula imposes.
											On the right, ancient Gothic,
											cut in the resistant material of steel by hand.
											None of the straight lines are actually straight.
											The curves are kind of subtle.
											It has that spark of life from the human hand
											that the machine or the program
											can never capture.
											What a contrast.

											Well, I tell a lie.
											A lie at TED. I&#39;m really sorry.
											Both of these were made on a computer,
											same software, same Bézier curves,
											same font format.
											The one on your left
											was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre,
											and I did the other one.
											The tool is the same, yet the letters are different.
											The letters are different
											because the designers are different.
											That&#39;s all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that.
											I wanted mine to look like that. End of story.
											Type is very adaptable.
											Unlike a fine art, such as sculpture or architecture,
											type hides its methods.
											I think of myself as an industrial designer.
											The thing I design is manufactured,
											and it has a function:
											to be read, to convey meaning.
											But there is a bit more to it than that.
											There&#39;s the sort of aesthetic element.
											What makes these two letters different
											from different interpretations by different designers?
											What gives the work of some designers
											sort of characteristic personal style,
											as you might find in the work of a fashion designer,
											an automobile designer, whatever?

									<p>
											There have been some cases, I admit,
											where I as a designer
											did feel the influence of technology.
											This is from the mid-&#39;60s,
											the change from metal type to photo,
											hot to cold.
											This brought some benefits
											but also one particular drawback:
											a spacing system that only provided
											18 discrete units for letters
											to be accommodated on.
											I was asked at this time to design
											a series of condensed sans serif types
											with as many different variants as possible
											within this 18-unit box.
											Quickly looking at the arithmetic,
											I realized I could only actually make three
											of related design. Here you see them.
											In Helvetica Compressed, Extra Compressed,
											and Ultra Compressed, this rigid 18-unit system
											really boxed me in.
											It kind of determined the proportions
											of the design.
											Here are the typefaces, at least the lower cases.
											So do you look at these and say,
											&quot;Poor Matthew, he had to submit to a problem,
											and by God it shows in the results.&quot;
											I hope not.
											If I were doing this same job today,
											instead of having 18 spacing units,
											I would have 1,000.
											Clearly I could make more variants,
											but would these three members
of the family be better?
											It&#39;s hard to say without actually doing it,
											but they would not be better in the proportion
											of 1,000 to 18, I can tell you that.
											My instinct tells you that any improvement
											would be rather slight, because they were designed
											as functions of the system they were designed to fit,
											and as I said, type is very adaptable.
											It does hide its methods.
											All industrial designers work within constraints.
											This is not fine art.

									<p>
											The question is, does a constraint
											force a compromise?
											By accepting a constraint,
											are you working to a lower standard?
											I don&#39;t believe so, and I&#39;ve always been encouraged
											by something that Charles Eames said.
											He said he was conscious of working
											within constraints,
											but not of making compromises.
											The distinction between a constraint
											and a compromise is obviously very subtle,
											but it&#39;s very central to my attitude to work.

											Remember this reading experience?
											The phone book. I&#39;ll hold the slide
											so you can enjoy the nostalgia.
											This is from the mid-&#39;70s early trials
											of Bell Centennial typeface I designed
											for the U.S. phone books,
											and it was my first experience of digital type,
											and quite a baptism.
											Designed for the phone books, as I said,
											to be printed at tiny size on newsprint
											on very high-speed rotary presses
											with ink that was kerosene and lampblack.
											This is not a hospitable environment
											for a typographic designer.
											So the challenge for me was to design type
											that performed as well as possible
											in these very adverse production conditions.
											As I say, we were in the infancy of digital type.
											I had to draw every character by hand
											on quadrille graph paper —
											there were four weights of Bell Centennial —
											pixel by pixel, then encode
them raster line by raster line
											for the keyboard.
											It took two years, but I learned a lot.
											These letters look as though they&#39;ve been chewed
											by the dog or something or other,
											but the missing pixels at the intersections
											of strokes or in the crotches
											are the result of my studying the effects
											of ink spread on cheap paper
											and reacting, revising the font accordingly.
											These strange artifacts are designed to compensate
											for the undesirable effects of scale
											and production process.
											At the outset, AT&amp;T had wanted
											to set the phone books in Helvetica,
											but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said
											in the Helvetica movie, if you&#39;ve seen that,
											the letters in Helvetica were designed to be
											as similar to one another as possible.
											This is not the recipe for legibility at small size.
											It looks very elegant up on a slide.
											I had to disambiguate these forms
											of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial
											by sort of opening the shapes up, as you can see
											in the bottom part of that slide.

									<p>
											So now we&#39;re on to the mid-&#39;80s,
											the early days of digital outline fonts,
											vector technology.
											There was an issue at that time
											with the size of the fonts,
											the amount of data that was required to find
											and store a font in computer memory.
											It limited the number of fonts you could get
											on your typesetting system at any one time.
											I did an analysis of the data,
											and found that a typical serif face
											you see on the left
											needed nearly twice as much data
											as a sans serif in the middle
											because of all the points required
											to define the elegantly curved serif brackets.
											The numbers at the bottom of the slide, by the way,
											they represent the amount of data
											needed to store each of the fonts.
											So the sans serif, in the middle,
											sans the serifs, was much more economical,
											81 to 151.

									<p>
											I made a serif type, you can see it on the right,
											without curved serifs.
											I made them polygonal, out
of straight line segments,
											chamfered brackets.
											And look, as economical in data as a sans serif.
											We call it Charter, on the right.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But here is where the story sort
of gets interesting for me.
											I didn&#39;t just throw my design away
											in a fit of pique.
											I persevered.
											What had started as a technical exercise
											became an aesthetic exercise, really.
											In other words, I had come to like this typeface.
											Forget its origins. Screw that.
											I liked the design for its own sake.
											The simplified forms of Charter
											gave it a sort of plain-spoken quality
											and unfussy spareness
											that sort of pleased me.
											You know, at times of technical innovation,
											designers want to be influenced
											by what&#39;s in the air.
											We want to respond. We want to be pushed
											into exploring something new.
											So Charter is a sort of parable for me, really.
											In the end, there was no hard and fast causal link
											between the technology and the design of Charter.
											I had really misunderstood the technology.
											The technology did suggest something to me,
											but it did not force my hand,
											and I think this happens very often.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											You know, engineers are very smart,
											and despite occasional frustrations
											because I&#39;m less smart,
											I&#39;ve always enjoyed working with them
											and learning from them.
											Apropos, in the mid-&#39;90s,
											I started talking to Microsoft
											about screen fonts.
											Up to that point, all the fonts on screen
											had been adapted from previously existing
											printing fonts, of course.
											But Microsoft foresaw correctly
											the movement, the stampede
											towards electronic communication,
											to reading and writing onscreen
											with the printed output as being sort of secondary
											in importance.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the priorities were just tipping at that point.
											They wanted a small core set of fonts
											that were not adapted but designed for the screen
											to face up to the problems of screen,
											which were their coarse resolution displays.
											I said to Microsoft, a typeface designed
											for a particular technology
											is a self-obsoleting typeface.
											I&#39;ve designed too many faces in the past
											that were intended to mitigate technical problems.
											Thanks to the engineers, the
technical problems went away.
											So did my typeface.
											It was only a stopgap.
											Microsoft came back to say that
											affordable computer monitors
											with better resolutions
											were at least a decade away.
											So I thought, well, a decade, that&#39;s not bad,
											that&#39;s more than a stopgap.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I was persuaded, I was convinced,
											and we went to work on what became Verdana
											and Georgia,
											for the first time working not on paper
											but directly onto the screen from the pixel up.
											At that time, screens were binary.
											The pixel was either on or it was off.
											Here you see the outline of a letter,
											the cap H,
											which is the thin black line, the contour,
											which is how it is stored in memory,
											superimposed on the bitmap,
											which is the grey area,
											which is how it&#39;s displayed on the screen.
											The bitmap is rasterized from the outline.
											Here in a cap H, which is all straight lines,
											the two are in almost perfect sync
											on the Cartesian grid.
											Not so with an O.
											This looks more like bricklaying
than type design,
											but believe me, this is a good bitmap O,
											for the simple reason that it&#39;s symmetrical
											in both x and y axes.
											In a binary bitmap, you actually can&#39;t ask
											for more than that.
											I would sometimes make, I don&#39;t know,
											three or four different versions of a difficult letter
											like a lowercase A,
											and then stand back to choose which was the best.
											Well, there was no best,
											so the designer&#39;s judgment comes in
											in trying to decide
											which is the least bad.
											Is that a compromise?
											Not to me, if you are working
											at the highest standard the technology will allow,
											although that standard may be
											well short of the ideal.
											You may be able to see on this slide
											two different bitmap fonts there.
											The &quot;a&quot; in the upper one, I think,
											is better than the &quot;a&quot; in the lower one,
											but it still ain&#39;t great.
											You can maybe see the effect better
											if it&#39;s reduced. Well, maybe not.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I&#39;m a pragmatist, not an idealist,
											out of necessity.
											For a certain kind of temperament,
											there is a certain kind of satisfaction
											in doing something that cannot be perfect
											but can still be done to the best of your ability.
											Here&#39;s the lowercase H from Georgia Italic.
											The bitmap looks jagged and rough.
											It is jagged and rough.
											But I discovered, by experiment,
											that there is an optimum slant
											for an italic on a screen
											so the strokes break well
											at the pixel boundaries.
											Look in this example how, rough as it is,
											how the left and right legs
											actually break at the same level.
											That&#39;s a victory. That&#39;s good, right there.
											And of course, at the lower depths,
											you don&#39;t get much choice.
											This is an S, in case you were wondering.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, it&#39;s been 18 years now
											since Verdana and Georgia were released.
											Microsoft were absolutely right,
											it took a good 10 years,
											but screen displays now do have
											improved spatial resolution,
											and very much improved photometric resolution
											thanks to anti-aliasing and so on.
											So now that their mission is accomplished,
											has that meant the demise
											of the screen fonts that I designed
											for coarser displays back then?
											Will they outlive the now-obsolete screens
											and the flood of new web fonts
											coming on to the market?
											Or have they established their own
											sort of evolutionary niche
											that is independent of technology?
											In other words, have they been absorbed
											into the typographic mainstream?
											I&#39;m not sure, but they&#39;ve had a good run so far.
											Hey, 18 is a good age for anything
											with present-day rates of attrition,
											so I&#39;m not complaining.

Matthew Carter started his career as a punchcutter, a print artisan who physically carves each letter into metal. He had already designed several legendary typefaces (in 1975, he created Bell Centennial for use in phone books) when he stepped into the digital design ring. As part of a project undertaken for Microsoft, Carter created early and successful examples of screen type emphasizing clarity and ease of long-term viewing, including the familiar Verdana, Galliard and Georgia. A recent work is MS Sitka, a family of digital fonts that are built to be readable at many sizes in print and onscreen.</p><p>Print and online publications such as <em>Sports Illustrated, Newsweek, Wired</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em> have all commissioned Carter fonts, leading Microsoft&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/News.aspx?NID=787\" target=\"_blank\">typography blog</a>  to call him &quot;the person who shapes the way we read about the world.&quot;</p><p>Carter is a principal of Carter &amp; Cone Type Inc., a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company specializing in designing and producing original typefaces.
