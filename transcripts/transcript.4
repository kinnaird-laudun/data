									<p>
											About 10 years ago, I took on the task
to teach global development
											to Swedish undergraduate students.
											That was after having spent about 20 years
											together with African institutions
studying hunger in Africa,
											so I was sort of expected
to know a little about the world.
											And I started in our medical university,
Karolinska Institute,
											an undergraduate course
called Global Health.
											But when you get that opportunity,
you get a little nervous.
											I thought, these students coming to us
											actually have the highest grade
you can get in Swedish college systems —
											so I thought, maybe they know everything
I&#39;m going to teach them about.
											So I did a pre-test when they came.
											And one of the questions
from which I learned a lot was this one:
											&quot;Which country has the highest
child mortality of these five pairs?&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I put them together,
so that in each pair of country,
											one has twice the child
mortality of the other.
											And this means that
it&#39;s much bigger a difference
											than the uncertainty of the data.
											I won&#39;t put you at a test here,
but it&#39;s Turkey,
											which is highest there, Poland,
Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.
											And these were the results
of the Swedish students.

											Let me make a comparison directly

of America and Vietnam.
											1964.
											America had small families and long life;
											Vietnam had large families
and short lives.
											And this is what happens:
											the data during the war indicate
that even with all the death,
											there was an improvement
of life expectancy.
											By the end of the year,
the family planning started in Vietnam;
											they went for smaller families.
											And the United States up there
is getting for longer life,
											keeping family size.
											And in the &#39;80s now,
they give up Communist planning
											and they go for market economy,
											and it moves faster even than social life.
											And today, we have in Vietnam
											the same life expectancy
and the same family size
											here in Vietnam, 2003,
											as in United States, 1974,
by the end of the war.
											If we don&#39;t look in the data,

in the world of the income.

of income of people.

or 100 dollars per day.
											There&#39;s no gap between rich

the world&#39;s annual income.
											And the richest 20 percent,

of developing countries
											is extremely doubtful.

											Of course it&#39;s a logarithmic scale here,

											If I change this, and take GDP per capita
instead of family income,

of gross domestic product,

in the same rate as money and health,

at the average data of the countries —

											because there is such
a lot of difference within countries.
											So if I go and look here,
we can see that Uganda today
											is where South Korea was in 1960.
											If I split Uganda, there&#39;s quite
a difference within Uganda.
											These are the quintiles of Uganda.
											The richest 20 percent
of Ugandans are there.
											The poorest are down there.
											If I split South Africa, it&#39;s like this.

											The 20 percent poorest

of South Africa is there,

there should be in Africa.
											Everything in this world exists in Africa.

This can&#39;t be done.
											Our information is so peculiar in detail,
											so that cannot be searched
as others can be searched.
											We cannot give the data
free to the students,
											free to the entrepreneurs of the world.&quot;

											But this is what we would
like to see, isn&#39;t it?
											The publicly-funded data is down here.
											And we would like flowers
to grow out on the Net.
											And one of the crucial points
is to make them searchable,
											and then people can use the different
design tool to animate it there.
											And I have pretty good news for you.
											I have good news that the present,
											new Head of U.N. Statistics,
he doesn&#39;t say it&#39;s impossible.
											He only says, &quot;We can&#39;t do it.&quot;

											So we can see a lot happening
in data in the coming years.
											We will be able to look at income
distributions in completely new ways.
											This is the income distribution
of China, 1970.
											This is the income distribution
of the United States, 1970.
											Almost no overlap.
											And what has happened?
											What has happened is this:

it&#39;s not so equal any longer,

overlooking the United States.

											But I think it&#39;s very important
to have all this information.
											We need really to see it.
											And instead of looking at this,
											I would like to end up by showing
the Internet users per 1,000.
											In this software, we access
about 500 variables
											from all the countries quite easily.
											It takes some time to change for this,
											but on the axises, you can quite easily
get any variable you would like to have.
											And the thing would be
to get up the databases free,
											to get them searchable,
and with a second click,
											to get them into the graphic formats,
where you can instantly understand them.
											Now, statisticians don&#39;t like it,
											because they say
that this will not show the reality;
											we have to have statistical,
analytical methods.
											But this is hypothesis-generating.

											I end now with the world.
											There, the Internet is coming.
											The number of Internet users
are going up like this.
											This is the GDP per capita.
											And it&#39;s a new technology coming in,
but then amazingly,
											how well it fits to the economy
of the countries.
											That&#39;s why the $100 computer
will be so important.
											But it&#39;s a nice tendency.
											It&#39;s as if the world
is flattening off, isn&#39;t it?
											These countries are lifting more
than the economy
											and will be very interesting
to follow this over the year,
											as I would like you to be able to do
with all the publicly funded data.

Global trends in health and economics come to vivid life. And the big picture of global development—with some surprisingly good news—snaps into sharp focus.","whylisten":"<p>Even the most worldly and well-traveled among us have had their perspectives shifted by Hans Rosling. A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\" target=\"_blank\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his work focused on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (as he pointed out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What set Rosling apart wasn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presented them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. A presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations were grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations and World Bank data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling took this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.gapminder.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />Hans Rosling passed away in February 2017. He is greatly missed.<br /><br /><br /> </p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen","viewed_count":12662135,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"You've never seen data presented like this.

Global trends in health and economics come to vivid life. And the big picture of global development—with some surprisingly good news—snaps into sharp focus.","whylisten":"<p>Even the most worldly and well-traveled among us have had their perspectives shifted by Hans Rosling. A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\" target=\"_blank\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his work focused on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (as he pointed out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What set Rosling apart wasn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presented them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. A presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations were grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations and World Bank data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling took this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.gapminder.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />Hans Rosling passed away in February 2017. He is greatly missed.<br /><br /><br /> </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Hans Rosling","tags":["Africa","Asia","Google","demo","economics","global issues","health","statistics","global development","visualizations","math"],"title":"The best stats you've ever seen","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":12662135}]}
