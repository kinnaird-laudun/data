											Thank you.
											It&#39;s a real pleasure to be here.
											I last did a TED Talk
											I think about seven years ago or so.
											I talked about spaghetti sauce.
											And so many people,
I guess, watch those videos.
											People have been
coming up to me ever since
											to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce,
											which is a wonderful thing
in the short term —
											(Laughter)
											but it&#39;s proven to be less than ideal
											over seven years.
											And so I though I would come
											and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me.

											The theme of this morning&#39;s
session is Things We Make.
											And so I thought I would tell a story
											about someone
											who made one of the most precious objects
											of his era.
											And the man&#39;s name is Carl Norden.
											Carl Norden was born in 1880.
											And he was Swiss.
											And of course, the Swiss can be divided
											into two general categories:
											those who make small, exquisite,
											expensive objects
											and those who handle the money
											of those who buy small, exquisite,
											expensive objects.
											And Carl Norden is very
firmly in the former camp.
											He&#39;s an engineer.
											He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.
											In fact, one of his classmates
is a young man named Lenin
											who would go on
											to break small, expensive,
exquisite objects.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And he&#39;s a Swiss engineer, Carl.
											And I mean that in its
fullest sense of the word.
											He wears three-piece suits;
											and he has a very, very small,
important mustache;
											and he is domineering
											and narcissistic
											and driven
											and has an extraordinary ego;
											and he works 16-hour days;
											and he has very strong feelings
about alternating current;
											and he feels like a suntan
is a sign of moral weakness;
											and he drinks lots of coffee;
											and he does his best work
											sitting in his mother&#39;s kitchen
in Zurich for hours
											in complete silence
											with nothing but a slide rule.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In any case,
											Carl Norden emigrates
to the United States
											just before the First World War
											and sets up shop on Lafayette Street
											in downtown Manhattan.
											And he becomes obsessed with the question
											of how to drop bombs from an airplane.
											Now if you think about it,
											in the age before GPS and radar,
											that was obviously
a really difficult problem.
											It&#39;s a complicated physics problem.
											You&#39;ve got a plane that&#39;s
thousands of feet up in the air,
											going at hundreds of miles an hour,
											and you&#39;re trying to drop
an object, a bomb,
											towards some stationary target
											in the face of all kinds
of winds and cloud cover
											and all kinds of other impediments.
											And all sorts of people,
											moving up to the First World War
and between the wars,
											tried to solve this problem,
											and nearly everybody came up short.
											The bombsights that were available
											were incredibly crude.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But Carl Norden is really
the one who cracks the code.
											And he comes up with this
incredibly complicated device.
											It weighs about 50 lbs.
											It&#39;s called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
											And it has all kinds of levers
and ball-bearings
											and gadgets and gauges.
											And he makes this complicated thing.
											And what he allows people to do
											is he makes the bombardier
take this particular object,
											visually sight the target,
											because they&#39;re in the Plexiglas
cone of the bomber,
											and then they plug in
the altitude of the plane,
											the speed of the plane,
the speed of the wind
											and the coordinates
											of the target.
											And the bombsight will tell him
when to drop the bomb.
											And as Norden famously says,
											&quot;Before that bombsight came along,
											bombs would routinely miss their target
											by a mile or more.&quot;
											But he said, with the
Mark 15 Norden bombsight,
											he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel
											at 20,000 ft.

									<p>
											Now I cannot tell you
											how incredibly excited
											the U.S. military was
											by the news of the Norden bombsight.
											It was like manna from heaven.
											Here was an army
											that had just had experience
in the First World War,
											where millions of men
											fought each other in the trenches,
											getting nowhere, making no progress,
											and here someone had come up with a device
											that allowed them to fly up in the skies
											high above enemy territory
											and destroy whatever they wanted
											with pinpoint accuracy.

											And the U.S. military
											spends 1.5 billion dollars —
											billion dollars in 1940 dollars —
											developing the Norden bombsight.
											And to put that in perspective,
											the total cost of the Manhattan project
											was three billion dollars.
											Half as much money was spent
on this Norden bombsight
											as was spent on the most famous
military-industrial project
											of the modern era.
											And there were people, strategists,
within the U.S. military
											who genuinely thought
that this single device
											was going to spell the difference
											between defeat and victory
											when it came to the
battle against the Nazis
											and against the Japanese.

									<p>
											And for Norden as well,
											this device had incredible
moral importance,
											because Norden was a committed Christian.
											In fact, he would always get upset
											when people referred to the
bombsight as his invention,
											because in his eyes,
											only God could invent things.
											He was simply
the instrument of God&#39;s will.
											And what was God&#39;s will?
											Well God&#39;s will was that
the amount of suffering in any kind of war
											be reduced to as small
an amount as possible.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And what did the Norden bombsight do?
											Well it allowed you to do that.
											It allowed you to bomb only those things
											that you absolutely needed
and wanted to bomb.
											So in the years leading up to
the Second World War,
											the U.S. military buys 90,000
											of these Norden bombsights
											at a cost of $14,000 each —
											again, in 1940 dollars,
that&#39;s a lot of money.
											And they trained 50,000 bombardiers
on how to use them —
											long extensive, months-long
training sessions —
											because these things are
essentially analog computers;
											they&#39;re not easy to use.
											And they make every one
of those bombardiers take an oath,
											to swear that if they&#39;re ever captured,
											they will not divulge a single detail
											of this particular device to the enemy,
											because it&#39;s imperative
the enemy not get their hands
											on this absolutely essential
piece of technology.

									<p>
											And whenever the Norden bombsight
is taken onto a plane,
											it&#39;s escorted there by
a series of armed guards.
											And it&#39;s carried in a box
with a canvas shroud over it.
											And the box is handcuffed
to one of the guards.
											It&#39;s never allowed to be photographed.
											And there&#39;s a little
incendiary device inside of it,
											so that, if the plane ever crashes,
it will be destroyed
											and there&#39;s no way the enemy
can ever get their hands on it.
											The Norden bombsight

									<p>
											So what happens during
the Second World War?
											Well, it turns out
it&#39;s not the Holy Grail.
											In practice, the Norden bombsight
											can drop a bomb into
a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.,
											but that&#39;s under perfect conditions.
											And of course, in wartime,
											conditions aren&#39;t perfect.
											First of all, it&#39;s really hard to use —
really hard to use.
											And not all of the people
											who are of those 50,000 men
who are bombardiers
											have the ability to properly
program an analog computer.
											Secondly, it breaks down a lot.
											It&#39;s full of all kinds
of gyroscopes and pulleys
											and gadgets and ball-bearings,
											and they don&#39;t work as well
as they ought to
											in the heat of battle.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Thirdly, when Norden
was making his calculations,
											he assumed that a plane would be flying
											at a relatively slow speed
at low altitudes.
											Well in a real war, you can&#39;t do that;
											you&#39;ll get shot down.
											So they started flying them
at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds.
											And the Norden bombsight
doesn&#39;t work as well
											under those conditions.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But most of all,
											the Norden bombsight
required the bombardier
											to make visual contact with the target.
											But of course, what happens in real life?
											There are clouds, right.
											It needs cloudless sky
to be really accurate.
											Well how many cloudless skies
											do you think there
were above Central Europe
											between 1940 and 1945?
											Not a lot.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then to give you a sense
											of just how inaccurate
the Norden bombsight was,
											there was a famous case in 1944
											where the Allies bombed
a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.
											And the chemical plant comprised
											757 acres.
											And over the course
of 22 bombing missions,
											the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs
											on this 757 acre chemical plant,
											using the Norden bombsight.
											Well what percentage of those bombs
											do you think actually landed
											inside the 700-acre
perimeter of the plant?
											10 percent. 10 percent.
											And of those 10 percent that landed,
											16 percent didn&#39;t even go off;
they were duds.
											The Leuna chemical plant,
											after one of the most extensive
bombings in the history of the war,
											was up and running within weeks.

									<p>
											And by the way, all those precautions
											to keep the Norden bombsight
out of the hands of the Nazis?
											Well it turns out
											that Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss,
											was very enamored of German engineers.
											So in the 1930s,
he hired a whole bunch of them,
											including a man named Hermann Long
											who, in 1938,
											gave a complete set of the plans
for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.
											So they had their own Norden bombsight
throughout the entire war —
											which also, by the way,
didn&#39;t work very well.

											So why do we talk about
the Norden bombsight?
											Well because we live in an age
											where there are lots and lots
											of Norden bombsights.
											We live in a time
where there are all kinds
											of really, really smart people
											running around, saying
that they&#39;ve invented gadgets

											In the Iraq War, at the beginning
of the first Iraq War,
											the U.S. military, the air force,
											sent two squadrons
of F-15E Fighter Eagles
											to the Iraqi desert
											equipped with these
five million dollar cameras
											that allowed them to see
the entire desert floor.
											And their mission was
to find and to destroy —
											remember the Scud missile launchers,
											those surface-to-air missiles
											that the Iraqis were launching
at the Israelis?
											The mission of the two squadrons
											was to get rid of all the
Scud missile launchers.
											And so they flew missions day and night,
											and they dropped thousands of bombs,
											and they fired thousands of missiles
											in an attempt to get rid
of this particular scourge.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And after the war was over,
there was an audit done —
											as the army always does,
the air force always does —
											and they asked the question:
											how many Scuds did we actually destroy?
											You know what the answer was?
											Zero, not a single one.
											Now why is that?
											Is it because their weapons
weren&#39;t accurate?
											Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate.
											They could have destroyed
this little thing right here
											from 25,000 ft.
											The issue was they didn&#39;t know
where the Scud launchers were.
											The problem with bombs and pickle barrels
											is not getting the bomb
inside the pickle barrel,
											it&#39;s knowing how to
find the pickle barrel.
											That&#39;s always been the harder problem
											when it comes to fighting wars.

											What is the signature weapon
											of the CIA&#39;s war in Northwest Pakistan?
											It&#39;s the drone. What is the drone?
											Well it is the grandson
of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
											It is this weapon of devastating
accuracy and precision.
											And over the course of the last six years

											the CIA has flown hundreds
of drone missiles,

											We think we&#39;re now at 95 percent accuracy

											the number of attacks, of suicide attacks

											against American forces in Afghanistan
											has increased tenfold.

											There&#39;s a postscript
											to the Norden story
											of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.
											And that is, on August 6, 1945,
											a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay
											flew over Japan
											and, using a Norden bombsight,
											dropped a very large thermonuclear device
											on the city of Hiroshima.
											And as was typical
with the Norden bombsight,
											the bomb actually
missed its target by 800 ft.
											But of course, it didn&#39;t matter.
											And that&#39;s the greatest irony of all
											when it comes to the Norden bombsight.
											the air force&#39;s 1.5 billion
dollar bombsight
											was used to drop
its three billion dollar bomb,
											which didn&#39;t need a bombsight at all.
