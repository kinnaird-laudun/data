<title>Sethembile Msezane: Living sculptures that stand for history&#39;s truths | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In the century-old statues that occupy Cape Town, Sethembile Mzesane didn&#39;t see anything that looked like her own reality. So she became a living sculpture herself, standing for hours on end in public spaces dressed in symbolic costumes, to reclaim the city and its public spaces for her community. In this powerful, tour-de-force talk, she shares the stories and motivation behind her mesmerizing performance art." />

So she became a living sculpture herself, standing for hours on end in public spaces dressed in symbolic costumes, to reclaim the city and its public spaces for her community.

											I&#39;d like for you to take a moment
to imagine this with me.
											You&#39;re a little girl of five years old.
											Sitting in front of a mirror,
											you ask yourself,
											&quot;Do I exist?&quot;
											In this space, there is
very little context,
											and so you move into a different one,
											one filled with people.
											Surely, now you know you&#39;re not
a figment of your own imagination.
											You breathe their air.
											You see them,
											so they must see you.
											And yet, you still can&#39;t help but wonder:
											Do I only exist when people speak to me?

											Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?
											But through various artworks
that reflect upon our society,
											I came to understand
how a young black girl can grow up
											feeling as if she&#39;s not seen,
and perhaps she doesn&#39;t exist.
											You see, if young people don&#39;t have
positive images of themselves
											and all that remains
are negative stereotypes,
											this affects their self-image.
											But it also affects the way
that the rest of society treats them.

											I discovered this
											having lived in Cape Town
for about five years at the time.
											I felt a deep sense
of dislocation and invisibility.
											I couldn&#39;t see myself represented.
											I couldn&#39;t see the women who&#39;ve raised me,
											the ones who&#39;ve influenced me,
											and the ones that have made
South Africa what it is today.
											I decided to do something about it.

											You see, public spaces are hardly
ever as neutral as they may seem.
											I discovered this when I made
this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.
											Cape Town is teeming
with masculine architecture,
											monuments and statues,
											such as Louis Botha in that photograph.
											This overt presence of white colonial
and Afrikaner nationalist men
											not only echoes a social,
gender and racial divide,
											but it also continues to affect
the way that women —
											and the way, particularly, black women —
											see themselves in relation
to dominant male figures
											in public spaces.
											For this reason, among others,
											I don&#39;t believe that we need statues.
											The preservation of history
and the act of remembering
											can be achieved in more memorable
and effective ways.

											As part of a year-long
public holiday series,
											I use performance art
as a form of social commentary
											to draw people&#39;s attention
to certain issues,
											as well as addressing the absence
of the black female body
											in memorialized public spaces,
											especially on public holidays.
											Women&#39;s Day was coming up.
											I looked at what the day means —
											the Women&#39;s March
to the union buildings in 1956,
											petitioning against the pass laws.
											Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy
of how women are treated,
											especially in public spaces today,
											I decided to do something about it.

											Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015,
											the Cecil John Rhodes statue
was scheduled to be removed
											after a month of debates
for and against its removal
											by various stakeholders.
											This caused a widespread interest
in statues in South Africa.
											Opinions varied, but the media
focused on problematizing
											the removal of statues.
											On that — well, that year,
I had just begun my master&#39;s
											at the University of Cape Town.
											During the time
of the debate of the statue,
											I had been having reoccurring dreams
											about a bird.
											And so I started conjuring her
											mentally, spiritually and through dress.
											On that day,
											I happened to be having
a meeting with my supervisors,
											and they told me that the statue
was going to fall on that day.
											I told them that I&#39;d explain later,
											but we had to postpone the meeting
											because I was going to perform her
as the statue came down.

											Her name was Chapungu.
											She was a soapstone bird
that was looted from Great Zimbabwe
											in the late 1800s,
											and is still currently housed
in Cecil John Rhodes&#39;s estate
											in Cape Town.
											On that day,
											I embodied her existence using my body,
											while standing in the blazing sun
for nearly four hours.
											As the time came,
											the crane came alive.
											The people did, too —
											shouting,
											screaming,
											clenching their fists
											and taking pictures of the moment
on their phones and cameras.
											Chapungu&#39;s wings,
											along with the crane,
											rose to declare the fall
of Cecil John Rhodes.

											Twenty-three years after apartheid,
											a new generation of radicals
has arisen in South Africa.
											The story of Chapungu and Rhodes
in the same space and time
											asks important questions
											related to gender,
											power,
											self-representation,
											history making
											and repatriation.
											From then on,
											I realized that my spiritual
beliefs and dreams
											texture my material reality.
											But for me, Chapungu&#39;s story
felt incomplete.
											This soapstone bird,
											a spiritual medium and messenger
of God and the ancestors,
											needed me to continue her story.
											And so I dabbled in the dream space
a little bit more,
											and this is how &quot;Falling&quot; was born.

In one iconic work, she performed at the removal of the John Cecil Rhodes statue at the University of Cape Town (&quot;Chapungu: The Day Rhodes Fell,&quot; 2015), and starting in 2013 she performed a series of pieces called &quot;Public Holiday&quot; that place her body in contrast to colonial-era monuments in Cape Town&#39;s CBD.</p><p>Msezane is a ANTI Festival International Prize for Live Art nominee (2017). She is the TAF &amp; Sylt Emerging Artist Residency Award winner (2016), and she is the first recipient of the Rising Light award at the Mbokodo Awards.
