Hear the story of how she went on to hack her online dating life -- with frustrating, funny and life-changing results." />

									<p>
											So my name is Amy Webb,
											and a few years ago
I found myself at the end
											of yet another fantastic relationship
											that came burning down
in a spectacular fashion.
											And I thought, what&#39;s wrong with me?
											I don&#39;t understand
why this keeps happening.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I asked everybody in my life
what they thought.
											I turned to my grandmother,
who always had plenty of advice,
											and she said, &quot;Stop being so picky.
											You&#39;ve got to date around.
											And most importantly,
											true love will find you
when you least expect it.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now as it turns out,
											I&#39;m somebody who thinks a lot about data,
											as you&#39;ll soon find.
											I am constantly swimming
in numbers, formulas and charts.
											I also have a very tight-knit family,
											and I&#39;m very, very close with my sister,
											and as a result, I wanted to have
the same type of family when I grew up.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I&#39;m at the end of this bad breakup,
											I&#39;m 30 years old,
											I figure I&#39;m probably going to have
to date somebody for about six months
											before I&#39;m ready to get monogamous
											and before we can sort of cohabitate,
											and we have to do that
for a while before we can get engaged.
											And if I want to start having children
by the time I&#39;m 35,
											that meant that I would have
had to have been on my way to marriage
											five years ago.
											So that wasn&#39;t going to work.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											If my strategy was to least-expect
my way into true love,
											then the variable that I had
to deal with was serendipity.
											In short, I was trying to figure out
											what&#39;s the probability
of my finding Mr. Right?
											Well, at the time I was living
in the city of Philadelphia,
											and it&#39;s a big city, and I figured,
											in this entire place,
there are lots of possibilities.
											So again, I started doing some math.
											Population of Philadelphia:
it has 1.5 million people.
											I figure about half of that are men,
											so that takes the number down to 750,000.
											I&#39;m looking for a guy
between the ages of 30 and 36,
											which was only four percent
of the population,
											so now I&#39;m dealing
with the possibility of 30,000 men.
											I was looking for somebody who was Jewish,
											because I am and that was important to me.
											That&#39;s only 2.3 percent of the population.
											I figure I&#39;m attracted to maybe
one out of 10 of those men,
											and there was no way I was going to deal
with somebody who was an avid golfer.
											So that basically meant
there were 35 men for me
											that I could possibly date
											in the entire city of Philadelphia.

									<p>
											In the meantime,
my very large Jewish family
											was already all married
and well on their way
											to having lots and lots of children,
											and I felt like I was
under tremendous peer pressure
											to get my life going already.

											Now, I like the idea of online dating,
											because it&#39;s predicated on an algorithm,
											and that&#39;s really just
a simple way of saying
											I&#39;ve got a problem,
I&#39;m going to use some data,
											run it through a system
and get to a solution.
											So online dating is the second
most popular way
											that people now meet each other,
											but as it turns out,
algorithms have been around
											for thousands of years
in almost every culture.
											In fact, in Judaism,
there were matchmakers a long time ago,
											and though they didn&#39;t have
an explicit algorithm per se,
											they definitely were running
through formulas in their heads,
											like, is the girl going to like the boy?
											Are the families going to get along?
											What&#39;s the rabbi going to say?
											Are they going to start
having children right away?
											The matchmaker would sort
of think through all of this,
											put two people together,
and that would be the end of it.
											So in my case, I thought,
											well, will data and an algorithm
lead me to my Prince Charming?
											So I decided to sign on.

											Now, there was one small catch.
											As I&#39;m signing on to the various
dating websites,
											as it happens, I was really, really busy.
											But that actually
wasn&#39;t the biggest problem.
											The biggest problem is that I hate
filling out questionnaires of any kind,
											and I certainly don&#39;t like questionnaires
that are like Cosmo quizzes.
											So I just copied
and pasted from my résumé.

wasn&#39;t taking flight,

looking at the menu.
											He was ordering multiple appetizers,
multiple entrées, for me as well,

and piles of food on our table,

											Well, it turns out
that these probably weren&#39;t bad guys.

											And as it happens, the algorithms
that were setting us up,

											These algorithms were doing exactly
what they were designed to do,
											which was to take
our user-generated information,
											in my case, my résumé,
											and match it up
with other people&#39;s information.
											See, the real problem here is that,
											while the algorithms work just fine,
											you and I don&#39;t,
											when confronted with blank windows
											where we&#39;re supposed to input
our information online.
											Very few of us have the ability
											to be totally and brutally
honest with ourselves.
											The other problem
is that these websites are asking us
											questions like, are you
a dog person or a cat person?
											Do you like horror films or romance films?
											I&#39;m not looking for a pen pal.
											I&#39;m looking for a husband. Right?
											So there&#39;s a certain amount

											So I said fine, I&#39;ve got a new plan.

these online dating sites,
											but I&#39;m going to treat them as databases,
											and rather than waiting
for an algorithm to set me up,
											I think I&#39;m going to try
reverse-engineering this entire system.
											So knowing that there was superficial data
											that was being used
to match me up with other people,
											I decided instead to ask my own questions.

and thoughts on our culture,

											I wanted somebody who worked hard,
											because work for me
is extremely important,
											but not too hard.
											For me, the hobbies that I have
											are really just new work projects
that I&#39;ve launched.
											I also wanted somebody
who not only wanted two children,
											but was going to have the same
attitude toward parenting that I do,
											so somebody who was going
to be totally okay
											with forcing our child to start
taking piano lessons at age three,
											and also maybe computer science classes
if we could wrangle it.
											So things like that,
but I also wanted somebody
											who would go to far-flung,

											and I ranked everything starting at 100

											and listing things like I was looking
for somebody who was really smart,

											Well, one month later,

content matters a lot.
											So smart people tend to write a lot —
											3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words
about themselves,

											The challenge here, though,
is that the popular men and women

non-specific language.

is my most favorite movie ever,
