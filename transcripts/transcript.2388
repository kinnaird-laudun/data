											As patients,
											we usually remember
the names of our doctors,
											but often we forget
the names of our nurses.
											I remember one.
											I had breast cancer a few years ago,
											and somehow I managed
to get through the surgeries
											and the beginning
of the treatment just fine.
											I could hide what was going on.
											Everybody didn&#39;t really have to know.
											I could walk my daughter to school,
											I could go out to dinner with my husband;
											I could fool people.
											But then my chemo was scheduled to begin
											and that terrified me
											because I knew that I was going to lose
every single hair on my body
											because of the kind of chemo
that I was going to have.
											I wasn&#39;t going to be able
to pretend anymore
											as though everything was normal.

									<p>
											I was scared.
											I knew what it felt like to have
everybody treating me with kid gloves,
											and I just wanted to feel normal.
											I had a port installed in my chest.
											I went to my first day of chemotherapy,
											and I was an emotional wreck.
											My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,
											and every bone in my body was telling
me to get up out of that chair
											and take for the hills.
											But Joanne looked at me and talked
to me like we were old friends.
											And then she asked me,
											&quot;Where&#39;d you get your highlights done?&quot;

											And I was like, are you kidding me?
											You&#39;re going to talk to me about my hair
when I&#39;m on the verge of losing it?
											I was kind of angry,
											and I said, &quot;Really? Hair?&quot;
											And with a shrug
of her shoulders she said,
											&quot;It&#39;s gonna grow back.&quot;
											And in that moment she said
the one thing I had overlooked,
											and that was that at some point,
my life would get back to normal.
											She really believed that.
											And so I believed it, too.

											Now, worrying about losing your hair
when you&#39;re fighting cancer
											may seem silly at first,
											but it&#39;s not just that you&#39;re worried
about how you&#39;re going to look.
											It&#39;s that you&#39;re worried that everybody&#39;s
going to treat you so carefully.
											Joanne made me feel normal
for the first time in six months.
											We talked about her boyfriends,
											we talked about looking
for apartments in New York City,
											and we talked about my reaction
to the chemotherapy —
											all kind of mixed in together.
											And I always wondered,
											how did she so instinctively
know just how to talk to me?

											Joanne Staha and my admiration for her
											marked the beginning of my journey
into the world of nurses.
											A few years later,
I was asked to do a project
											that would celebrate
the work that nurses do.
											I started with Joanne,
											and I met over 100 nurses
across the country.
											I spent five years interviewing,
photographing and filming nurses
											for a book and a documentary film.
											With my team,
											we mapped a trip across America
that would take us to places
											dealing with some of the biggest
public health issues facing our nation —
											aging, war, poverty, prisons.
											And then we went places
											where we would find
the largest concentration of patients
											dealing with those issues.
											Then we asked hospitals and facilities
to nominate nurses
											who would best represent them.

											One of the first nurses I met
was Bridget Kumbella.
											Bridget was born in Cameroon,
											the oldest of four children.
											Her father was at work
when he had fallen from the fourth floor
											and really hurt his back.
											And he talked a lot about what it was like
to be flat on your back
											and not get the kind
of care that you need.
											And that propelled Bridget
to go into the profession of nursing.
											Now, as a nurse in the Bronx,
											she has a really diverse group
of patients that she cares for,
											from all walks of life,
											and from all different religions.
											And she&#39;s devoted her career
to understanding the impact
											of our cultural differences
when it comes to our health.
											She spoke of a patient —
											a Native American patient that she had —
											that wanted to bring
a bunch of feathers into the ICU.
											That&#39;s how he found spiritual comfort.
											And she spoke of advocating for him
											and said that patients come
from all different religions
											and use all different kinds
of objects for comfort;
											whether it&#39;s a holy rosary
or a symbolic feather,
											it all needs to be supported.

											This is Jason Short.
											Jason is a home health nurse
in the Appalachian mountains,
											and his dad had a gas station
and a repair shop when he was growing up.
											So he worked on cars in the community
that he now serves as a nurse.
											When he was in college,
											it was just not macho at all
to become a nurse,
											so he avoided it for years.
											He drove trucks for a little while,
											but his life path was always
pulling him back to nursing.
											As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,
											Jason goes places
that an ambulance can&#39;t even get to.
											In this photograph,
he&#39;s standing in what used to be a road.
											Top of the mountain mining
flooded that road,
											and now the only way
for Jason to get to the patient
											living in that house
with black lung disease
											is to drive his SUV
against the current up that creek.
											The day I was with him,
we ripped the front fender off the car.
											The next morning he got up,
put the car on the lift,

the work of nursing really is.

											When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.
											He had just come back from a deployment
											and he hadn&#39;t really settled back in
to life in San Diego yet.
											He talked about his experience
of being a nurse in Germany
											and taking care of the soldiers
coming right off the battlefield.
											Very often, he would be
the first person they would see
											when they opened
their eyes in the hospital.
											And they would look at him
as they were lying there,
											missing limbs,
											and the first thing they would say is,
											&quot;When can I go back?
I left my brothers out there.&quot;
											And Brian would have to say,
											&quot;You&#39;re not going anywhere.
											You&#39;ve already given enough, brother.&quot;
											Brian is both a nurse and a soldier
who&#39;s seen combat.
											So that puts him in a unique position
											to be able to relate to and help heal
the veterans in his care.

											This is Sister Stephen,
											and she runs a nursing home
in Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.
											And the entire circle of life
can be found under her roof.
											She grew up wishing they lived on a farm,
											so given the opportunity
to adopt local farm animals,
											she enthusiastically brings them in.
											And in the springtime,
those animals have babies.
											And Sister Stephen uses
those baby ducks, goats and lambs
											as animal therapy
for the residents at Villa Loretto
											who sometimes can&#39;t
remember their own name,
											but they do rejoice
in the holding of a baby lamb.
											The day I was with Sister Stephen,
											I needed to take her away
from Villa Loretto
											to film part of her story.
											And before we left,
											she went into the room of a dying patient.
											And she leaned over and she said,
											&quot;I have to go away for the day,
											but if Jesus calls you,
											you go.
											You go straight home to Jesus.&quot;
											I was standing there and thinking
											it was the first time in my life
											I witnessed that you could show
someone you love them completely
											by letting go.
											We don&#39;t have to hold on so tightly.
											I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto
											than I have ever seen at any other time
at any other place in my life.

											We live in a complicated time
when it comes to our health care.
											It&#39;s easy to lose sight
of the need for quality of life,
											not just quantity of life.
											As new life-saving
technologies are created,
											we&#39;re going to have really
complicated decisions to make.
											These technologies often save lives,
											but they can also prolong pain
and the dying process.
											How in the world are we supposed
to navigate these waters?
											We&#39;re going to need
all the help we can get.
											Nurses have a really unique
relationship with us
											because of the time spent at bedside.
											During that time,
											a kind of emotional intimacy develops.

											This past summer, on August 9,
											my father died of a heart attack.
											My mother was devastated,
											and she couldn&#39;t imagine
her world without him in it.
											Four days later she fell,
											she broke her hip,
											she needed surgery
											and she found herself
fighting for her own life.
											Once again I found myself
											on the receiving end
of the care of nurses —
											this time for my mom.
											My brother and my sister and I
stayed by her side
											for the next three days in the ICU.
											And as we tried
to make the right decisions
											and follow my mother&#39;s wishes,
											we found that we were depending
upon the guidance of nurses.
											And once again,
											they didn&#39;t let us down.
											They had an amazing insight
in terms of how to care for my mom
											in the last four days of her life.
											They brought her comfort
and relief from pain.
											They knew to encourage my sister and I
to put a pretty nightgown on my mom,
											long after it mattered to her,
											but it sure meant a lot to us.
											And they knew to come and wake me up
just in time for my mom&#39;s last breath.
											And then they knew
how long to leave me in the room
											with my mother after she died.

From people &quot;living positively&quot; with AIDS to women artisans supporting entire communities and nurses on the front lines of our health care system, Carolyn Jones has devoted her career to celebrating invisible populations and breaking down barriers.</p><p>Jones has spent the past five years interviewing more than 150 nurses from every corner of the US in an effort to better understand the role of nurses in this country&#39;s healthcare system. She published the critically-acclaimed book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/WA5eTY\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The American Nurse: Photographs and Interviews</em></a>&nbsp;by Carolyn Jones, for which she was interviewed on PBS NewsHour and featured in the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>USA Today</em>. She directed and executive-produced the follow-up documentary film <em>The American Nurse: Healing America</em>, which was released in theaters nationwide and was an official selection of the 2015 American Film Showcase, a cultural diplomacy program of the US Department of State.</p><p>Jones has spent her career focused on telling personal stories, and her first introduction to nursing was through a very personal experience of her own, when it was a nurse who helped her get through breast cancer. That experience stuck with her, so when she started working on the American Nurse Project in 2011, she was determined to paint a rich and dynamic portrait of the profession. The goal was to cover as much territory as possible, with the hope that along the way she would capture stories touching on the kinds of issues that nurses are dealing with in every corner of the country. The project explores the American experiences of health care, poverty, childbirth, war, imprisonment and the end of life through the lens of nursing.</p><p>Prior to <em>The American Nurse</em>, her most widely acclaimed book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/58SsAK6\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Living Proof: Courage in the Face of AIDS</em></a>, was published by Abbeville Press and was accompanied by shows in Tokyo, Berlin, the USA, and at the United Nations World AIDS Conference. In addition to her multiple exhibitions, book and magazine publications, Jones has collaborated on projects with Oxygen Media, PBS and the Girl Scouts of the USA. She founded the non-profit 100 People Foundation for which she travels the world telling stories that celebrate our global neighbors. As a lecturer, Jones has spoken at conferences, universities and events around the globe. In 2012 she was honored as one of 50 &quot;Everyday Heroes&quot; in the book of that title for her work with the 100 People Foundation.</p><p>Jones&#39; career was punctuated by two brushes with death: first, running out of gas in the Sahara as a racecar driver, and second, a breast cancer diagnosis. Her newest project, the forthcoming documentary&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hope.film/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Defining Hope</em></a>, is the culmination of a journey investigating how we can make better end-of-life choices.&nbsp;</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/carolyn_jones_a_tribute_to_nurses","viewed_count":1228645,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"Carolyn Jones recommends","blurb":"Check out extra resources, curated by Carolyn Jones.","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":"","type":"recommendation","rec_lists":[{"title":"The American Nurse Project","description":"","rec_items":[{"label":"EXPLORE","headline":"The American Nurse Project","blurb":"","note":"","link_url":"http://americannurseproject.com/press/","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Article","headline":"\"Portraits of Compassion: Photographer Shows Voice, Fortitude of American Nurses\"","blurb":"","note":"PBS News Hour, 2013","link_url":"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health-july-dec13-nurse_08-05/","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"WATCH","headline":"The American Nurse on \"Katie\"","blurb":"\"Katie,\" 2014","note":"","link_url":"https://vimeo.com/101485669","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Everyday Heroes* book excerpt","blurb":"","note":"100 People Foundation\r\n2012","link_url":"http://100people.org/images/Carolyn_Jones_EH_Full_Spread.pdf","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""}]},{"title":"Reading list\r\n","description":"These books have guided me as I focus on what matters most in life.","rec_items":[{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Gratitude*","blurb":"I have loved and been loved, he wrote.

attention towards issues of global concern.","whylisten":"<p>Best known for her socially proactive photographs and documentary films, Carolyn Jones creates projects that point our attention towards issues of global concern. From people &quot;living positively&quot; with AIDS to women artisans supporting entire communities and nurses on the front lines of our health care system, Carolyn Jones has devoted her career to celebrating invisible populations and breaking down barriers.</p><p>Jones has spent the past five years interviewing more than 150 nurses from every corner of the US in an effort to better understand the role of nurses in this country&#39;s healthcare system. She published the critically-acclaimed book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/WA5eTY\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The American Nurse: Photographs and Interviews</em></a>&nbsp;by Carolyn Jones, for which she was interviewed on PBS NewsHour and featured in the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>USA Today</em>. She directed and executive-produced the follow-up documentary film <em>The American Nurse: Healing America</em>, which was released in theaters nationwide and was an official selection of the 2015 American Film Showcase, a cultural diplomacy program of the US Department of State.</p><p>Jones has spent her career focused on telling personal stories, and her first introduction to nursing was through a very personal experience of her own, when it was a nurse who helped her get through breast cancer. That experience stuck with her, so when she started working on the American Nurse Project in 2011, she was determined to paint a rich and dynamic portrait of the profession. The goal was to cover as much territory as possible, with the hope that along the way she would capture stories touching on the kinds of issues that nurses are dealing with in every corner of the country. The project explores the American experiences of health care, poverty, childbirth, war, imprisonment and the end of life through the lens of nursing.</p><p>Prior to <em>The American Nurse</em>, her most widely acclaimed book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/58SsAK6\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Living Proof: Courage in the Face of AIDS</em></a>, was published by Abbeville Press and was accompanied by shows in Tokyo, Berlin, the USA, and at the United Nations World AIDS Conference. In addition to her multiple exhibitions, book and magazine publications, Jones has collaborated on projects with Oxygen Media, PBS and the Girl Scouts of the USA. She founded the non-profit 100 People Foundation for which she travels the world telling stories that celebrate our global neighbors. As a lecturer, Jones has spoken at conferences, universities and events around the globe. In 2012 she was honored as one of 50 &quot;Everyday Heroes&quot; in the book of that title for her work with the 100 People Foundation.</p><p>Jones&#39; career was punctuated by two brushes with death: first, running out of gas in the Sahara as a racecar driver, and second, a breast cancer diagnosis. Her newest project, the forthcoming documentary&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hope.film/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Defining Hope</em></a>, is the culmination of a journey investigating how we can make better end-of-life choices.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Carolyn Jones","tags":["cancer","empathy","community","compassion","health","family","humanity","health care","medicine","life","personal growth","society","TEDMED","death"],"title":"A tribute to nurses","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1228645}]}
