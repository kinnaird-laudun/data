									<p>
											Good morning.
											My name is David Rose.
											I am a serial entrepreneur
turned serial investor.
											And by the use of pitching
PowerPoints to VCs,
											I have personally raised
tens of millions of dollars
											from VCs through PowerPoint pitches.
											And turning to the other side
of the equation,
											I&#39;ve personally supervised the investment
of tens of millions of dollars
											into companies who have pitched me
with PowerPoint presentations.
											So I think it&#39;s safe to say
											I know a little bit
about the process of pitching.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, the very first question
you&#39;ve got to figure out is:
											What is the single most important
thing that a VC is looking for
											when you come to them
pitching your new business idea?
											There are obviously all kinds of things —
											business models and financials
and markets and this and that.
											Overall, of all the things
that you have to do,
											what is the single most important thing
											the VC is going to be investing in?
											Somebody? What?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Audience: People!
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											David Rose: People! You!
That&#39;s it — you are the person.
											Therefore, the entire purpose
of a VC pitch is to convince them
											that you are the entrepreneur in whom
they are going to invest their money
											and make a lot of money in return.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, how do you do this?
											You can&#39;t just walk up and say,
											&quot;Hi, I&#39;m a really good guy, good girl,
and you should invest in me.&quot; Right?
											So in the course of your VC pitch —
you have a very few minutes;
											most VC pitches, angel pitches,
are about 15 minutes,
											most should be less than half an hour —
											people&#39;s attention span,
after 18 minutes, begins to drop off.
											Tests have shown.
											So in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,
											you have to convey a whole bunch
of different characteristics,
											about 10 different characteristics,
											while you&#39;re standing up there.
											What&#39;s the single most important thing
you&#39;ve got to convey? What?
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!
											That&#39;s a straight line, look at that!
											And I didn&#39;t even prompt him.
											Right, integrity. The key thing.
											I would much rather invest in,
take a chance on,
											somebody who I know is straight
than where there&#39;s any possible question
											of who are they looking out for,
and what&#39;s going on.
											So the most important thing is integrity.
											What&#39;s the second most important thing?
											Let&#39;s see if you can get this one.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											DR: Close enough. Passion.
											Right? Entrepreneurs, by definition,
are people who are leaving something else,
											starting a new world, creating and putting
their lifeblood into this thing.
											You&#39;ve got to convey passion.
											If you&#39;re not passionate,
											why should anyone else be,
or put money into your company
											if you&#39;re not passionate about it?
											Integrity, passion:
the most important things.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Then there&#39;s a whole panoply
of other things you&#39;ve got to wrap up
											in this package you&#39;re presenting to a VC.
											Experience: you&#39;ve got to be able to say,
											&quot;Hey, you know, I&#39;ve done this before.&quot;
											&quot;Done this before&quot; is starting
an enterprise, creating value,
											and taking something
from beginning to end.
											That&#39;s why VCs love to fund
serial entrepreneurs —
											even if you didn&#39;t do it right
the first time,
											you&#39;ve learned the lessons, which puts
you in good stead the next time.

of the world out there.

companies I&#39;ve heard of,

somebody else has approved this,

you got an award for something;

											says this makes sense.
											And then, I&#39;m looking for the upside;

to be upside and believable.
											The upside means if you tell me
that five years out,
											you&#39;re making a million dollars a year,

This is, you know, two sentences.
											&quot;We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market.&quot;
