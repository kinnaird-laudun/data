											So, if you believe the media accounts,
											being a drug dealer in the height
of the crack cocaine epidemic
											was a very glamorous life,
in the words of Virginia Postrel.
											There was money,
there was drugs, guns, women,
											you know, you name it — jewelry,
bling-bling — it had it all.

											What I&#39;m going to tell you today is that,
in fact, based on 10 years of research,
											a unique opportunity
to go inside a gang —
											to see the actual books,
the financial records of the gang —
											that the answer turns out not to be
											that being in the gang
was a glamorous life.
											But I think, more realistically,
that being in a gang —
											selling drugs for a gang — is perhaps
the worst job in all of America.
											And that&#39;s what I&#39;d like
to convince you of today.

											So there are three things I want to do.

how and why crack cocaine
											had such a profound influence
on inner-city gangs.
											Secondly, I want to tell you
											how somebody like me
came to be able to see
											the inner workings of a gang —
an interesting story, I think.
											And then third, I want to tell you,
in a very superficial way,
											about some of the things we found
											when we actually got to look
at the financial records,
											the books, of the gang.

											So let me start by talking
about crack cocaine,
											and how it transformed the gang.
											To do that, you have to actually go
back to a time before crack cocaine,
											in the early &#39;80s, and look at it
from the perspective of a gang leader.
											Being a gang leader in the inner city
wasn&#39;t such a bad deal in the mid-&#39;80s —
											the early &#39;80s, let me say.

											Now, you had a lot of power,
and you got to beat people up —
											you got a lot of prestige,
a lot of respect.
											But the thing is,
there was no money in it.
											The gang had no way to make money.
											You couldn&#39;t charge dues
to the people in the gang,
											because the people in the gang
didn&#39;t have any money.
											You couldn&#39;t really make any money
selling marijuana —
											marijuana&#39;s too cheap, it turns out.
											You can&#39;t get rich selling marijuana.
											You couldn&#39;t sell cocaine;
											cocaine&#39;s a great product —
powdered cocaine —
											but you&#39;ve got to know rich white people.
											And most of the inner-city gang members
didn&#39;t know any rich white people,
											so couldn&#39;t sell to that market.
											You couldn&#39;t really do
petty crime, either.
											Turns out, petty crime&#39;s
a terrible way to make a living.

											So what was it about crack cocaine?
											It was a brilliant way
of getting the brain high.
											Because you could smoke crack cocaine —
you can&#39;t smoke powdered cocaine —
											and smoking is a much more efficient
mechanism of delivering a high
											than snorting it.
											And it turned out there was this audience
that didn&#39;t know it wanted crack cocaine,
											but when it came, it really did.
											And it was a perfect drug;
											you could buy the cocaine
that went into it for a dollar,
											sell it for five dollars.
											Highly addictive —
the high was very short.

you get this great high,

very dark-skinned South Asian.

											So he showed up
at the University of Chicago,
											and the famous sociologist
William Julius Wilson
											was doing a book that involved
surveying people all across Chicago.

to go do some surveys for him,

the place to send him,

											So what did we find?
											What did we find in the gang?
											Well, let me say one thing:
											We really got access
to everybody in the gang.
											We got an inside look at the gang,
from the very bottom up to the very top.
											They trusted Sudhir, in ways
that really no academic has ever —
											or really anybody, any outsider —
has ever earned the trust of these gangs,
											to the point where they actually opened up
											what was most interesting
for me — their books,
											the financial records they kept.
											They made them available to us,
and we not only could study them,
											but we could ask them questions
about what was in them.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So if I have to kind of summarize
very quickly in the short time I have
											what the bottom line of what
I take away from the gang is,
											it&#39;s that, if I had to draw
a parallel between the gang
											and any other organization,
											it would be that the gang
is just like McDonald&#39;s,
											in a lot of different respects —
the restaurant McDonald&#39;s.

											So first, in one way,
											which isn&#39;t maybe the most interesting
way, but it&#39;s a good way to start —
											is in the way it&#39;s organized,
the hierarchy of the gang,
											the way it looks.
											So here&#39;s what the org chart
of the gang looks like.
											I don&#39;t know if you know much
about org charts,
											but if you were to assign a stripped-down
and simplified McDonald&#39;s org chart,
											this is exactly what it would look like.
											It&#39;s amazing, but the top
level of the gang,
											they actually call themselves
the &quot;Board of Directors.&quot;

like &quot;Wall Street,&quot;
											and they had learned a little bit
about what it was like

corner, selling the drugs.
											Extremely dangerous work.
											And important to note is that almost all
of the weight, all of the people
											in this organization are at the bottom —
just like McDonald&#39;s.
											So in some sense, the foot soldiers
are a lot like the people
											who are taking your order at McDonald&#39;s,
											and it&#39;s not just by chance
that they&#39;re like them.
											In fact, in these neighborhoods,
they&#39;d be the same people.
											So the same kids who are working

											at the very same time,
typically working part-time
											at a place like McDonald&#39;s.
											Which already foreshadows
the main result that I&#39;ve talked about,
											about what a crappy job
it was, being in the gang.

											So what do the wages look like?
You might be surprised.

											this is what it looks
like in terms of the wages.
											The hourly wage the foot soldiers
were earning was $3.50 an hour.
											It was below the minimum wage.
And this is well-documented.
											It&#39;s easy to see by the patterns
of consumption they have.

what are the death rates?
											We found, in our gang —

											let&#39;s think about some other walk of life
you may expect might be extremely risky.
											Let&#39;s say that you were a murderer
											and you were convicted of murder,
and you&#39;re sent to death row.
											It turns out, the death rates on death row
from all causes, including execution:
											two percent a year.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So it&#39;s a lot safer being on death row
											than it is selling drugs
out on the street.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That gives you some pause,
for those of you who believe
											that a death penalty&#39;s going to have
an enormous deterrent effect on crime.
											To give you a sense of just how bad
the inner city was during crack —
											and I&#39;m not really focusing
on the negatives,
											but really, there&#39;s another story
to tell you there —
											if you look at the death rates
just of random, young black males
											growing up in the inner city
in the United States,
											the death rates during crack
were about one percent.
											That&#39;s extremely high.
											And this is violent death —
it&#39;s unbelievable, in some sense.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											To put it into perspective: if you compare
this to the soldiers in Iraq,
											for instance, right now
fighting the war: 0.5 percent.
											So in some very literal way,
											the young black men who were
growing up in this country
											were living in a war zone,
											very much in the sense that the soldiers
over in Iraq are fighting in a war.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So why in the world, you might ask,
											would anybody be willing
to stand out on a street corner
											selling drugs for $3.50 an hour,
											with a 25 percent chance of dying
over the next four years?
											Why would they do that?
											And I think there are a couple answers.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I think the first one
is that they got fooled by history.
											It used to be the gang
was a rite of passage;
											that the young people controlled the gang;
											that as you got older,
you dropped out of the gang.
											So what happened was,
											the people who happened to be
in the right place at the right time —
											the people who happened to be leading
the gang in the mid-to-late-&#39;80s —
											became very, very wealthy.
											And so the logical thing to think
											was that they are going
to age out of the gang
											like everybody else has,
											and the next generation is going
to take over and get the wealth.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											There are striking similarities,
I think, to the Internet boom.
											The first set of people in Silicon Valley
got very, very rich.
											And then all of my friends said,
&quot;Maybe I should go do that, too.&quot;
											And they were willing to work very cheap
for stock options that never came.
											In some sense,
that&#39;s what happened, exactly,
											to the set of people we were looking at.
											They were willing to start at the bottom,
											just like, say, a first-year
lawyer at a law firm
											is willing to start at the bottom,
											work 80-hour weeks
for not that much money,
											because they think
they&#39;re going to make partner.
											But the rules changed,
and they never got to make partner.

									<p>
											Indeed, the same people who were running
all of the major gangs in the late 1980s
											are still running the major gangs
in Chicago today.
											They never passed on any of the wealth,
											So everybody got stuck
at that $3.50-an-hour job,
											and it turned out to be a disaster.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The other thing the gang was
very good at was marketing and trickery.
											And so for instance,
one thing the gang would do is —
											the gang leaders would have
big entourages,
											and they&#39;d drive fancy cars
and have fancy jewelry.
											So what Sudhir eventually realized
as he hung out with them more,
											is that, really, they didn&#39;t own
those cars — they just leased them,
											because they couldn&#39;t afford
to own the fancy cars.
											And they didn&#39;t really have gold jewelry,
they had gold-plated jewelry.
											It goes back to, you know,
the real-real versus the fake-real.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And really, they did all sorts
of things to trick the young people
											into thinking what a great deal
the gang was going to be.
											So for instance, they would give
a 14-year-old kid
											a whole roll of bills to hold.
											That 14-year-old kid
would say to his friends,
											&quot;Hey, look at all the money
I got in the gang.&quot;
											It wasn&#39;t his money — until he spent it,
											and then he was in debt to the gang,
											and was sort of an indentured
servant for a while.
											So I have a couple minutes.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Let me do one last thing
I hadn&#39;t thought I&#39;d have time to do,
											which is to talk about what we learned
more generally about economics,
											from the study of the gang.
									</p>
								</div>

									<p>
											So, economists tend to talk
in technical words.
											Often, our theories fail quite miserably
when we over the data,
											but what&#39;s kind of interesting
is that in this setting,
											it turned out that
some of the economic theories
											that worked not so well
in the real economy
											worked very well in the drug economy,
											in some sense, because
it&#39;s unfettered capitalism.
											Here&#39;s an economic principle.
											This is one of the basic ideas
in labor economics,
											called a &quot;compensating differential.&quot;
											It&#39;s the idea that the increment to wages
that a worker requires
											to leave him indifferent
between performing two tasks,
											one which is more unpleasant
than the other.
											Compensating differential — it&#39;s why
we think garbagemen might be paid more
											than people who work in parks.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The words of one of the members
of the gang, I think, make this clear.
											So it turns out — I&#39;m sort
of getting ahead of myself —
											it turns out, in the gang,
when there&#39;s a war going on,
											they actually pay the foot soldiers
twice as much money.
											It&#39;s exactly this concept.
											Because they&#39;re not willing to be at risk.
											And the words of a gang member
capture it quite nicely, he says:
											&quot;Would you stand around here when all
this shit ...&quot; — the shooting —
											&quot;... if all this shit&#39;s
going on? No, right?
											So if I gonna be asked to put my life
on the line, then front me the cash, man.&quot;
											I think the gang member says it
much more articulately
											than the economist, about what&#39;s going on.

									<p>
											Here&#39;s another one.
											Economists talk about game theory,
											that every two-person game
has a Nash equilibrium.
											Here&#39;s the translation
you get from the gang member.
											They&#39;re talking about the decision
of why they don&#39;t go shoot —
											One thing that turns out to be a great
business tactic in the gang:
											if you go and just shoot guns in the air
in the other gang&#39;s territory —
											people are afraid to go buy drugs there,
											they&#39;re going to come
into your neighborhood.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Here&#39;s what he says
about why they don&#39;t do that:
											&quot;If we start shooting around there,
the other gang&#39;s territory,
											nobody, I mean, you dig it,
nobody gonna step on their turf.
											But we gotta be careful,
											&#39;cause they can shoot around here too
and then we all fucked.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So that&#39;s the same concept.
											Then again, sometimes
economists get it wrong.
											One thing we observed in the data
is that it looked like —
											the gang leader always got paid.
											No matter how bad it was economically,
he always got himself paid.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We had some theories related to cash flow,
											and lack of access to capital markets,
and things like that.
											Then we asked the gang member,
											&quot;Why is it you always get paid
and your workers don&#39;t always get paid?&quot;
											His response is,
											&quot;You got all these niggers below you
who want your job, you dig?
											If you start taking losses,
they see you as weak and shit.&quot;
											And I thought about it and said,
											&quot;CEOs often pay themselves
million-dollar bonuses,
											even when companies
are losing a lot of money.
											And it never would really occur
to an economist
											that this idea of &#39;weak and shit&#39;
could really be important.&quot;
