											Welcome to 10,000 feet.
											Let me explain why we are here
											and why some of you have a pine cone close to you.
											Once upon a time, I did a book called &quot;How Buildings Learn.&quot;
											Today&#39;s event you might call &quot;How Mountains Teach.&quot;
											A little background: For 10 years I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to
											hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking
											to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare —
											or in some cases, non-existent.
											It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking
											of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know,
											next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years —
											basically civilization&#39;s story so far.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.
											It&#39;s an incubator for about a dozen projects,
											all having to do with continuity over the long term.
											Our core project is a rather ambitious folly —
											I suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock
											that can really keep good time for that long a period.
											And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious.
											Go to the clock. And what we have here is something
											many of you saw here three years ago.
											It&#39;s the first working prototype of the clock.
											It&#39;s about nine feet high.
											Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It&#39;s presently in London,
											and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the design problem for today is going to be,
											how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this
											so it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries?
											Well, this was the first solution.
											Alexander Rose came up with this idea
											of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps.
											And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking
											about, what does deep time do to a building?
											Well, this is what deep time does to a building.
											This is the Parthenon. It&#39;s only 2,450 years old,
											and look what happened to it.
											Here&#39;s a beautiful project. They really knew it&#39;d last forever,
											because they&#39;d build it out of absolutely huge stones.
											And now it&#39;s a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.
											That&#39;s what happens to buildings. They&#39;re vulnerable.
											Even the most durable and intactable buildings,
											like the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close.
											They&#39;ve been looted inside and out.
											And they&#39;re built to protect things but they don&#39;t protect things.

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we got to thinking, if you can&#39;t put things safely in a building,
											where can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground.
											How about underground with a view?
											Underground in a place that&#39;s really solid.
											So the obvious answer was, we need a mountain.
											You don&#39;t want just any mountain.
											You need absolutely the right mountain
											if you&#39;re going to have a clock for 10,000 years.
											So here&#39;s an image of the long view of the search problem.
											And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain,
											so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest.
											We looked at mesas in New Mexico.
											We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona.

											Then Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service,
											led us to Eastern Nevada,
											to America&#39;s newest and oldest national park,
											which is called Great Basin National Park.
											It&#39;s right on the eastern border of Nevada.
											It&#39;s the highest range in the state — over 13,000 feet.
											And you&#39;ll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it&#39;s very steep,
											and on the right it&#39;s gentle.
											This place is remote. It&#39;s over 200 miles from any major city.
											It&#39;s nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.
											And it&#39;s — the only thing that goes by is what&#39;s called
											America&#39;s loneliest highway, U.S. 50.

											Now, inside the yellow line here, on the right is — that&#39;s all national park.
											Inside the green line is national forest.
											And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land.
											Now, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle,
											this vertical, was available because it was private land.
											And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here,
											who started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land.
											And now let&#39;s look at the grand truth of what&#39;s there.

											We&#39;re in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment
											of Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.
											Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone.
											That&#39;s a 2,000-foot thick formation,
											and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.
											It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike
											to get up to where the clock is.
											So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors
											and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain
											to explore it and investigate, one, if it&#39;s the right mountain,
											and two, if it&#39;s the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.

									<p>
											Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem.
											He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.
											It&#39;s what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.
											It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind
											of the goal at the end of the journey.
											In this case it might well be an image of the clock.
											Then there&#39;s the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition

											Then — this is a nice image of it, there&#39;s the labyrinth.
											The labyrinth is a concept, it&#39;s like a twilight zone,
											it&#39;s a place where it&#39;s difficult, where you get disoriented,
											maybe you get scared — but you have to go through it
											if you&#39;re going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.
											Then there should always be in sight the draw —
											a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth
											to finish the process of getting there.

											And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff.

											You&#39;ve got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world,

											And then, how about a memento? Number seven.
											At the end of it there&#39;s something physical,

											How do you study a mountain

											that&#39;s national park. That&#39;s sacrosanct —
											you can&#39;t do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest.
											There&#39;s possibilities. The borders are important.
											Other elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.
											And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there.
											It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines.
											They&#39;re the world&#39;s oldest living thing.
											People think they&#39;re just the size of shrubs, but that&#39;s not actually true.
											There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.
											The wood is so solid it&#39;s like stone, and it lasts for a long time.
											So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain,
											some of them go back 10,000 years.

											You&#39;ll find out why it&#39;s called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience. 

											Here&#39;s Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest
											on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones
											was discovered, led by a theory.
											Edmund Schulman in the 1950s
											had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline,
											and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine
											called, &quot;Longevity under Adversity in Conifers.&quot;
											And then, based on that principle, he started looking around
											at the various trees at Timberline,
											and realized that the bristlecone pines —
											he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.
											Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right.

											Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth,

											and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere

											And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington.
											Let&#39;s go to approaches.
											As it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington,
											just a few old mining roads like this,
											so you have to bushwhack everywhere.
											But there&#39;s no bears, and there&#39;s no poison oak,

											It&#39;s this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs,
											and it&#39;s an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom,

											Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.
											You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain.
											And from where you&#39;re standing at 6,000 feet in the valley,
											it&#39;s an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest
											through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.
											And you can carry right on up through meadows

											Now, Danny and I were up at this same area one day,

											which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it,
											and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain
											could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view.
											And the people toiling up the mountain could see them,
											these tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff.
											How did they get there? Do I have to do that?
											And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.
											You can get another angle on Danny&#39;s porch
											by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there. 

											And you need to know that Danny&#39;s clock is to be kept accurate
											by a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day,
											and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger

											This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs,
											that&#39;s some of the Long Now land in those trees.
											And if you go up there and look back, then you&#39;ll get a sense of
											what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain.

											Now, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs,

											there is a 600-foot drop. He&#39;s ambling on over to Zander&#39;s Siq.

											And it&#39;s not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation
											of the basic structure of the mountain,
											and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside. 

											This is architecture not made by building,
											but by what you very carefully take away.
											So that&#39;s what the mountain taught us.
											Most of the amazingness of the clock
											we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.
											All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them.
											It&#39;s not a clock in a mountain — it&#39;s a mountain clock.
											Now, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying
											for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything.
											They say, &quot;pin peya obe&quot; — welcome to the mountain.
