											I&#39;m not. I&#39;m a parent, I&#39;m a resident and I&#39;m a teacher.
											And this is my world.
											And along the way I&#39;ve started noticing —
											I&#39;m on my third generation of kids —
											that they&#39;re getting bigger.
											They&#39;re getting sicker.
											In addition to these complexities,
											I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see
											who are labeled learning disabled would not have been
											had they had proper prenatal nutrition.

											The realities of my community are simple. They look like this.
											Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.
											And as jobs continue to leave my community,
											and energy continues to come in, be exported in,
											it&#39;s no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.
											But I&#39;m the oldest sixth grader you&#39;ll ever meet,
											so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm
											that I&#39;m hoping to share with you all today.
											And with that note, I come to you with this belief
											that kids should not have to leave their communities
											to live, learn and earn in a better one.

									<p>
											So I&#39;m here to tell you a story about me
											and this wall that I met outside, which I&#39;m now bringing inside.
											And it starts with three people.
											The crazy teacher — that&#39;s me on the left,
											I dress up pretty, thank you, my wife, I love you for getting a good suit —
											my passionate borough president
											and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies
											who helped me with my class
											and helped me get involved with this patented technology.
											But it all starts with seeds in classrooms,
											in my place, which looks like this.
											And I&#39;m here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp.
											And that&#39;s really what this is all about.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And it starts with incredible kids like this,
											who come early and stay late.
											All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners,
											most come with a lot of handicaps,
											most are homeless and many are in foster care.
											Almost all of my kids live below poverty.
											But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom,
											and this is what it looks like in my classroom.
											And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.
											And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.
									</p>

									<p>
											But again, I am not a farmer. I&#39;m a teacher.
											And I don&#39;t like weeding, and I don&#39;t like back-breaking labor.
											So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success
											into something small, like this,
											and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it,
											kids who didn&#39;t want to be outside could do it,
											and everyone could have access.
											So I called George Irwin, and what do you know?
											He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.
											And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences,
											private-based learning.
											And lo and behold, we gave birth to
											the first edible wall in New York City.

											We decided to go to Boston.
											And my kids, from the poorest congressional district in America,
											became the first to install a green wall,
											designed by a computer, with real-live learning tools,
											21 stories up — if you&#39;re going to go visit it,
											it&#39;s on top of the John Hancock building.
											But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools
											that look like this with lighting like that,
											real LED stuff, 21st-century technology.
											And what do you know? We made 21st century money,
											and that was groundbreaking. Wow!

											And what&#39;d we do then? Well, I met nice people like you,
											and they invited us to the Hamptons.
											So I call this &quot;from South Bronx to Southampton.&quot;
											And we started putting in roofs that look like this,
											and we came in from destitute neighborhoods
											to start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.
											And so we got invited back this past summer,
											and we actually moved into the Hamptons,
											payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house, and we learned how to surf.
											And when you can do stuff like this —
											These are my kids putting in this technology,
											and when you can build a roof that looks like that

											So, you may wonder what does a wall like this
											really do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets?
											Okay, I&#39;m going to tell you what it does.
											It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this,
											Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.
											And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.
											Because Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers,
											really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing
											for New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.
											And this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.

											Now, if you&#39;re like me, you live in a building, there are seven guys
											out of work looking to manage a million dollars.
											I don&#39;t have it. But if you need a toilet fixed
											or, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months
											for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.
											That&#39;s the beauty of this economy.
											But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade.
											And that&#39;s my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account.
											This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM.
											And this is the true triple bottom line,

											So CNN called, and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer&#39;s market.

											could you put this thing up on the walls? We were delighted.
											But this, I show you, when kids from the poorest congressional district in America
											can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall,
											design it, plant it and install it in the heart of New York City,

											But this is not a Getty image.
											That&#39;s a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President,

											That&#39;s our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder,

											And when the Bronx Borough President shows up
											and the State Senator comes to our class,
											believe you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now.
											We are poised, ready, willing and able
											to export our talent and diversity in ways we&#39;ve never even imagined.

											A year ago today, I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine.
											I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York
											made sense, especially when the resources were free.
											So thank you all and I love them.
											They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health,
											again, free resources, don&#39;t waste them.
											And what do you know? Six months later,
											my school and my kids were awarded the first ever
											high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment.
											The greenest class in New York City.
											But more importantly is my kids learned to get,
											they learned to give.
											And we took the money that we made from our farmer&#39;s market,
											and started buying gifts for the homeless
											and for needy around the world.
											So we started giving back.
											And that&#39;s when I realized that the greening of America
											starts first with the pockets, then with the heart

											And my kids, trained and certified —
											Ma, you get the tax abatement. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg —

											Okay? And these are my future farmers of America,

											And when Henry knows that green is good, so do I.
											And when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.
