											I have a question for you:
											Are you religious?
											Please raise your hand right now
											if you think of yourself as a religious person.
											Let&#39;s see, I&#39;d say about three or four percent.
											I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.
											(Laughter)
											Okay, here&#39;s another question:
											Do you think of yourself as spiritual
											in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.
											Okay, that&#39;s the majority.

											My Talk today
											is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons,
											why most people consider themselves
											to be spiritual in some way, shape or form.
											My Talk today is about self-transcendence.
											It&#39;s just a basic fact about being human
											that sometimes the self seems to just melt away.
											And when that happens,
											the feeling is ecstatic
											and we reach for metaphors of up and down
											to explain these feelings.
											We talk about being uplifted
											or elevated.

									<p>
											Now it&#39;s really hard to think about anything abstract like this
											without a good concrete metaphor.
											So here&#39;s the metaphor I&#39;m offering today.
											Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms,
											most of which we&#39;re very familiar with.
											But sometimes it&#39;s as though a doorway appears
											from out of nowhere
											and it opens onto a staircase.
											We climb the staircase
											and experience a state of altered consciousness.

											In 1902,
											the great American psychologist William James
											wrote about the many varieties of religious experience.
											He collected all kinds of case studies.
											He quoted the words of all kinds of people
											who&#39;d had a variety of these experiences.
											One of the most exciting to me
											is this young man, Stephen Bradley,
											had an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.
											And here&#39;s what Bradley said about it.

											(Video) Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape
											for about one second in the room,
											with arms extended,
											appearing to say to me, &quot;Come.&quot;
											The next day I rejoiced with trembling.
											My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.
											This world had no place in my affections.
											Previous to this time,
											I was very selfish and self-righteous.
											But now I desired the welfare of all mankind
											and could, with a feeling heart,
											forgive my worst enemies.

											how Bradley&#39;s petty, moralistic self
											just dies on the way up the staircase.
											And on this higher level
											he becomes loving and forgiving.
											The world&#39;s many religions have found so many ways
											to help people climb the staircase.
											Some shut down the self using meditation.
											Others use psychedelic drugs.
											This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll
											showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom
											and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.
											Others use dancing, spinning and circling
											to promote self-transcendence.
											But you don&#39;t need a religion to get you through the staircase.
											Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature.
											Others overcome their self at raves.

											But here&#39;s the weirdest place of all:
											war.
											So many books about war say the same thing,
											that nothing brings people together
											like war.
											And that bringing them together opens up the possibility
											of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.
											I&#39;m going to play for you an excerpt
											from this book by Glenn Gray.
											Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.
											And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers
											and wrote about the experience of men in battle.
											Here&#39;s a key passage
											where he basically describes the staircase.

											(Video) Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit
											that the experience of communal effort in battle
											has been the high point of their lives.
											&quot;I&quot; passes insensibly into a &quot;we,&quot;
											&quot;my&quot; becomes &quot;our&quot;
											and individual faith
											loses its central importance.
											I believe that it is nothing less
											than the assurance of immortality
											that makes self-sacrifice at these moments
											so relatively easy.
											I may fall, but I do not die,
											for that which is real in me goes forward
											and lives on in the comrades

											JH: So what all of these cases have in common
											is that the self seems to thin out, or melt away,
											and it feels good, it feels really good,
											in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.
											It feels somehow uplifting.
											This idea that we move up was central in the writing
											of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim.
											Durkheim even called us Homo duplex,
											or two-level man.
											The lower level he called the level of the profane.
											Now profane is the opposite of sacred.
											It just means ordinary or common.
											And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.
											We want to satisfy our individual desires.
											We pursue our individual goals.
											But sometimes something happens
											that triggers a phase change.
											Individuals unite
											into a team, a movement or a nation,
											which is far more than the sum of its parts.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred
											because he believed that the function of religion
											was to unite people into a group,
											into a moral community.
											Durkheim believed that anything that unites us
											takes on an air of sacredness.
											And once people circle around
											some sacred object or value,
											they&#39;ll then work as a team and fight to defend it.
											Durkheim wrote
											about a set of intense collective emotions
											that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum,
											of making a group out of individuals.
											Think of the collective joy in Britain
											on the day World War II ended.
											Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square,
											which brought down a dictator.
											And think of the collective grief
											in the United States
											that we all felt, that brought us all together,
											after 9/11.

											So let me summarize where we are.
											I&#39;m saying that the capacity for self-transcendence
											is just a basic part of being human.
											I&#39;m offering the metaphor
											of a staircase in the mind.
											I&#39;m saying we are Homo duplex
											and this staircase takes us up from the profane level
											to the level of the sacred.
											When we climb that staircase,
											self-interest fades away,
											we become just much less self-interested,
											and we feel as though we are better, nobler
											and somehow uplifted.

									<p>
											So here&#39;s the million-dollar question
											for social scientists like me:
											Is the staircase
											a feature of our evolutionary design?
											Is it a product of natural selection,
											like our hands?
											Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system —
											this religious stuff is just something
											that happens when the wires cross in the brain —
											Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience,
											it&#39;s just a mistake?

											Well many scientists who study religion take this view.
											The New Atheists, for example,
											argue that religion is a set of memes,
											sort of parasitic memes,
											that get inside our minds
											and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff,
											self-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.
											And after all,
											how could it ever be good for us
											to lose ourselves?
											How could it ever be adaptive
											for any organism
											to overcome self-interest?
											Well let me show you.

											In &quot;The Descent of Man,&quot;
											Charles Darwin wrote a great deal
											about the evolution of morality —
											where did it come from, why do we have it.
											Darwin noted that many of our virtues
											are of very little use to ourselves,
											but they&#39;re of great use to our groups.
											He wrote about the scenario
											in which two tribes of early humans
											would have come in contact and competition.
											He said, &quot;If the one tribe included
											a great number of courageous, sympathetic
											and faithful members
											who are always ready to aid and defend each other,
											this tribe would succeed better
											and conquer the other.&quot;
											He went on to say that &quot;Selfish and contentious people
											will not cohere,
											and without coherence
											nothing can be effected.&quot;
											In other words,
											Charles Darwin believed
											in group selection.

											Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years,

											especially after E.O. Wilson&#39;s book comes out in April,
											making a very strong case
											that we, and several other species,
											are products of group selection.
											But really the way to think about this

											So look at it this way:
											You&#39;ve got competition going on within groups and across groups.
											So here&#39;s a group of guys on a college crew team.
											Within this team
											there&#39;s competition.
											There are guys competing with each other.
											The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.
											And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.
											Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.
											So within the team,
											their interests are actually pitted against each other.
											And sometimes it would be advantageous
											for one of these guys
											to try to sabotage the other guys.
											Maybe he&#39;ll badmouth his chief rival
											to the coach.
											But while that competition is going on
											within the boat,
											this competition is going on across boats.
											And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat,
											now they&#39;ve got no choice but to cooperate
											because they&#39;re all in the same boat.
											They can only win
											if they all pull together as a team.
											I mean, these things sound trite,

									<p>
											The main argument against group selection
											has always been
											that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators,
											but as soon as you have a group of cooperators,
											they&#39;re just going to get taken over by free-riders,
											individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.
											Let me illustrate this for you.
											Suppose we&#39;ve got a group of little organisms —
											they can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn&#39;t matter what —
											and let&#39;s suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.
											Well that&#39;s great. They graze, they defend each other,
											they work together, they generate wealth.
											And as you&#39;ll see in this simulation,
											as they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow,
											and when they&#39;ve doubled in size, you&#39;ll see them split,
											and that&#39;s how they reproduce and the population grows.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But suppose then that one of them mutates.
											There&#39;s a mutation in the gene
											and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.
											It takes advantage of the others.
											And so when a green interacts with a blue,
											you&#39;ll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.
											So here&#39;s how things play out.
											We start with just one green,
											and as it interacts
											it gains wealth or points or food.
											And in short order, the cooperators are done for.
											The free-riders have taken over.
											If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem
											then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation
											and group selection cannot get started.

									<p>
											But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
											It&#39;s not that hard a problem.
											In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.
											And nature&#39;s favorite solution
											is to put everyone in the same boat.
											For example,
											why is it that the mitochondria in every cell
											has its own DNA,
											totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?
											It&#39;s because they used to be
											separate free-living bacteria
											and they came together
											and became a superorganism.
											Somehow or other — maybe one swallowed another; we&#39;ll never know exactly why —
											but once they got a membrane around them,
											they were all in the same membrane,
											now all the wealth-created division of labor,
											all the greatness created by cooperation,
											stays locked inside the membrane
											and we&#39;ve got a superorganism.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And now let&#39;s rerun the simulation
											putting one of these superorganisms
											into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters
											and look what happens.
											A superorganism can basically take what it wants.
											It&#39;s so big and powerful and efficient
											that it can take resources
											from the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.
											And pretty soon the whole population
											is actually composed of these new superorganisms.
											What I&#39;ve shown you here
											is sometimes called a major transition
											in evolutionary history.
											Darwin&#39;s laws don&#39;t change,
											but now there&#39;s a new kind of player on the field
											and things begin to look very different.

											Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature
											that just happened with some bacteria.
											It happened again
											about 120 or a 140 million years ago
											when some solitary wasps
											began creating little simple, primitive
											nests, or hives.
											Once several wasps were all together in the same hive,
											they had no choice but to cooperate,
											because pretty soon they were locked into competition
											with other hives.
											And the most cohesive hives won,
											just as Darwin said.

											These early wasps
											gave rise to the bees and the ants
											that have covered the world

											And it happened again,
											even more spectacularly,
											in the last half-million years
											when our own ancestors
											became cultural creatures,
											they came together around a hearth or a campfire,
											they divided labor,
											they began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects,
											and eventually they worshiped their own gods.
											Once they were all in the same tribe,
											they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.
											And they unlocked the most powerful force
											ever known on this planet,
											which is human cooperation —
											a force for construction

											Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive

											We&#39;re not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.
											In fact, often,
											as we&#39;ve seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts,
											often those divisions are along religious lines.
											Nonetheless, when people do come together

											(Video) Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties
											of religious experience,
											as William James explained.
											One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase
											and losing ourselves.
											The staircase takes us
											from the experience of life as profane or ordinary
											upwards to the experience of life as sacred,
											or deeply interconnected.
											We are Homo duplex,
											as Durkheim explained.
											And we are Homo duplex
											because we evolved by multilevel selection,
											as Darwin explained.
											I can&#39;t be certain if the staircase is an adaptation
											rather than a bug,
											but if it is an adaptation,
											then the implications are profound.
											If it is an adaptation,
											then we evolved to be religious.

											I don&#39;t mean that we evolved
											to join gigantic organized religions.
											Those things came along too recently.
											I mean that we evolved
											to see sacredness all around us
											and to join with others into teams
											and circle around sacred objects,
											people and ideas.
											This is why politics is so tribal.
											Politics is partly profane, it&#39;s partly about self-interest,
											but politics is also about sacredness.
											It&#39;s about joining with others
											to pursue moral ideas.
											It&#39;s about the eternal struggle between good and evil,

											And most importantly,
											if the staircase is real,

											hivish creatures like bees.
											We&#39;re bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.
