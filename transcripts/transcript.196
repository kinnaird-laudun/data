<title>Craig Venter: On the verge of creating synthetic life | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: &quot;Can we create new life out of our digital universe?&quot; Craig Venter asks. His answer is &quot;yes&quot; -- and pretty soon. He walks through his latest research and promises that we&#39;ll soon be able to build and boot up a synthetic chromosome. NOTE: This talk was given in 2008, and this field of science has developed quickly since then. Read &quot;Criticisms &amp;amp; updates&quot; below for more details." />

											You know, I&#39;ve talked about some of these projects before —
											about the human genome and what that might mean,
											and discovering new sets of genes.
											We&#39;re actually starting at a new point:
											we&#39;ve been digitizing biology,
											and now we&#39;re trying to go from that digital code
											into a new phase of biology
											with designing and synthesizing life.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, we&#39;ve always been trying to ask big questions.
											&quot;What is life?&quot; is something that I think many biologists
											have been trying to understand
											at various levels.
											We&#39;ve tried various approaches,
											paring it down to minimal components.
											We&#39;ve been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;
											when we sequenced the human genome,
											it was going from the analog world of biology
											into the digital world of the computer.
											Now we&#39;re trying to ask, &quot;Can we regenerate life
											or can we create new life
											out of this digital universe?&quot;
									</p>

											This is the map of a small organism,
											Mycoplasma genitalium,
											that has the smallest genome for a species
											that can self-replicate in the laboratory,
											and we&#39;ve been trying to just see if
											we can come up with an even smaller genome.
											We&#39;re able to knock out on the order of 100 genes
											out of the 500 or so that are here.
											When we look at its metabolic map,
											it&#39;s relatively simple
											compared to ours —
											trust me, this is simple —
											but when we look at all the genes
											that we can knock out one at a time,
											it&#39;s very unlikely that this would yield
											a living cell.
											So we decided the only way forward
											was to actually synthesize this chromosome
											so we could vary the components
											to ask some of these most fundamental questions.
											And so we started down the road of:
											can we synthesize a chromosome?
											Can chemistry permit making
											these really large molecules
											where we&#39;ve never been before?
											And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?
											A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.
											So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing
											at an exponential pace.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Our ability to write the genetic code
											has been moving pretty slowly
											but has been increasing,
											and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.
											We started this over 15 years ago.
											It took several stages, in fact,
											starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.
											But it turns out synthesizing DNA
											is very difficult.
											There are tens of thousands of machines around the world
											that make small pieces of DNA —
											30 to 50 letters in length —
											and it&#39;s a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,
											the more errors there are.
											So we had to create a new method
											for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information
											of the genome of phi X174.
											It&#39;s a small virus that kills bacteria.
											We designed the pieces, went through our error correction
											and had a DNA molecule
											of about 5,000 letters.
											The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical
											and put it in the bacteria,
											and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,
											made the viral particles.
											The viral particles then were released from the cells
											and came back and killed the E. coli.
											I was talking to the oil industry recently
											and I said they clearly understood that model.

											And so, we think this is a situation
											where the software can actually build its own hardware
											in a biological system.
											But we wanted to go much larger:
											we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome —
											it&#39;s over 580,000 letters of genetic code —
											so we thought we&#39;d build them in cassettes the size of the viruses
											so we could actually vary the cassettes
											to understand
											what the actual components of a living cell are.
											Design is critical,
											and if you&#39;re starting with digital information in the computer,
											that digital information has to be really accurate.
											When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,
											the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.
											We actually found, on resequencing it,
											30 errors; had we used that original sequence,
											it never would have been able to be booted up.
											Part of the design is designing pieces
											that are 50 letters long
											that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces
											to build smaller subunits
											we have to design so they can go together.
											We design unique elements into this.

											You may have read that we put watermarks in.
											Think of this:
											we have a four-letter genetic code — A, C, G and T.
											Triplets of those letters
											code for roughly 20 amino acids,
											such that there&#39;s a single letter designation
											for each of the amino acids.
											So we can use the genetic code to write out words,
											sentences, thoughts.
											Initially, all we did was autograph it.
											Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.
											We designed these pieces so
											we can just chew back with enzymes;
											there are enzymes that repair them and put them together.
											And we started making pieces,
											starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,
											put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,
											then put sets of those going up to 72,000.

									<p>
											At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance
											so we could sequence them
											because we&#39;re trying to create a process that&#39;s extremely robust
											that you can see in a minute.
											We&#39;re trying to get to the point of automation.
											So, this looks like a basketball playoff.
											When we get into these really large pieces
											over 100,000 base pairs,
											they won&#39;t any longer grow readily in E. coli —
											it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology —
											and so we turned to other mechanisms.
											We knew there&#39;s a mechanism called homologous recombination
											that biology uses to repair DNA
											that can put pieces together.
											Here&#39;s an example of it:
											there&#39;s an organism called
											Deinococcus radiodurans
											that can take three millions rads of radiation.

											You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.
											Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it
											back together exactly as it was before.
											We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
											These organisms can be totally desiccated;
											they can live in a vacuum.
											I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space,
											move around, find a new aqueous environment.
											In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.

											So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.
											This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code;
											it&#39;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.
											It&#39;s over 300 million molecular weight.
											If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing,
											it takes 142 pages
											just to print this genetic code.
											Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?
											Obviously, with a virus it&#39;s pretty simple;
											it&#39;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria.
											It&#39;s also simpler when you go
											into eukaryotes like ourselves:
											you can just pop out the nucleus
											and pop in another one,
											and that&#39;s what you&#39;ve all heard about with cloning.
											With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,
											but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant
											of a chromosome from one cell to another
											and activate it.
											We purified a chromosome from one microbial species —
											roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice —
											we added a few extra genes
											so we could select for this chromosome,
											we digested it with enzymes
											to kill all the proteins,
											and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell —
											and you&#39;ll appreciate
											our very sophisticated graphics here.
											The new chromosome went into the cell.
											In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,
											but we tried to design the process a little bit further.

											This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.
											We find all kinds of species
											that have taken up a second chromosome
											or a third one from somewhere,
											adding thousands of new traits
											in a second to that species.
											So, people who think of evolution
											as just one gene changing at a time

											There are enzymes called restriction enzymes
											that actually digest DNA.
											The chromosome that was in the cell
											doesn&#39;t have one;
											the chromosome we put in does.
											It got expressed and it recognized
											the other chromosome as foreign material,
											chewed it up, and so we ended up
											just with a cell with the new chromosome.
											It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.
											And with a very short period of time,
											all the characteristics of one species were lost
											and it converted totally into the new species
											based on the new software that we put in the cell.
											All the proteins changed,
											the membranes changed;
											when we read the genetic code, it&#39;s exactly what we had transferred in.

									<p>
											So, this may sound like genomic alchemy,
											but we can, by moving the software of DNA around,
											change things quite dramatically.
											Now I&#39;ve argued, this is not genesis;
											this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.
											And I&#39;ve argued that we&#39;re about to perhaps
											create a new version of the Cambrian explosion,
											where there&#39;s massive new speciation

									<p>
											Why do this?
											I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.
											We&#39;re about to go from six and a half
											to nine billion people over the next 40 years.
											To put it in context for myself:
											I was born in 1946.
											There are now three people on the planet
											for every one of us that existed in 1946;
											within 40 years, there&#39;ll be four.
											We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,
											medicines, fuel
											for the six and a half billion.
											It&#39;s going to be a stretch to do it for nine.
											We use over five billion tons of coal,
											30 billion-plus barrels of oil —
											that&#39;s a hundred million barrels a day.
											When we try to think of biological processes
											or any process to replace that,
											it&#39;s going to be a huge challenge.
											Then of course, there&#39;s all that
											CO2 from this material
											that ends up in the atmosphere.

											We now, from our discovery around the world,
											have a database with about 20 million genes,
											and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.
											The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components,
											and look at the diversity that came out of that.
											We&#39;re limited here primarily
											by a biological reality
											and our imagination.
											We now have techniques,
											because of these rapid methods of synthesis,
											to do what we&#39;re calling combinatorial genomics.
											We have the ability now to build a large robot
											that can make a million chromosomes a day.
											When you think of processing these 20 million different genes
											or trying to optimize processes
											to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals,
											new vaccines,
											we can just with a small team,
											do more molecular biology
											than the last 20 years of all science.
											And it&#39;s just standard selection:

											You know, we don&#39;t know necessarily what it&#39;ll look like:
											we know exactly what their genetic code looks like.
											We&#39;re focusing on now fourth-generation fuels.
											You&#39;ve seen recently, corn to ethanol
											is just a bad experiment.
											We have second- and third-generation fuels

											It takes CO2 to methane

In 2003, he started mapping the ocean's biodiversity. And now he's created the first synthetic lifeforms -- microorganisms that can produce alternative fuels.","whylisten":"<p>Craig Venter, the man who led the private effort to sequence the human genome, is hard at work now on even more potentially world-changing projects. </p><p>First, there&#39;s his mission aboard the <em><a href=\"http://www.sorcerer2expedition.org/version1/HTML/main.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sorcerer II</a>,</em> a 92-foot yacht<strong>, </strong>which, in 2006, finished its voyage around the globe to sample, catalouge and decode the genes of the ocean&#39;s unknown microorganisms. Quite a task, when you consider that there are tens of millions of microbes in a single drop of sea water. Then there&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.jcvi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">J. Craig Venter Institute</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to researching genomics and exploring its societal implications. </p><p>In 2005, Venter founded <a href=\"http://www.syntheticgenomics.com/about.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Synthetic Genomics</a>, a private company with <strong>a provocative mission: to engineer new life forms</strong>. Its goal is to design, synthesize and assemble <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_laboratorium\" target=\"_blank\">synthetic microorganisms</a>  that will produce alternative fuels, such as ethanol or hydrogen. He was on <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Time</em></a>  magzine&#39;s 2007 list of the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100\" target=\"_blank\">100 Most Influential People in the World.</a> </p><p>In early 2008, scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute announced that they had manufactured the entire genome of a bacterium by painstakingly stitching together its chemical components. By sequencing a genome, scientists can begin to custom-design bootable organisms, creating biological robots that can produce from scratch chemicals humans can use, such as biofuel. And in 2010, they announced, they had created &quot;synthetic life&quot; -- DNA created digitally, inserted into a living bacterium, and remaining alive.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Craig Venter","tags":["alternative energy","creativity","energy","genetics","global issues","invention","science","technology"],"title":"On the verge of creating synthetic life","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1030402}]}
