to save lives in my own way.

aunties and uncles as well.
											Most of you. OK.
											We, the adults of the last
four generations,
											have blessed our children with the destiny
											of a shorter lifespan
than their own parents.
											Your child will live a life
ten years younger than you
											because of the landscape of food
that we&#39;ve built around them.
											Two-thirds of this room,

overweight or obese.

											Now, if I came up here, and I wish

											Okay so, in my world,
what do we need to do?
											Here is the thing, right,

											So, supermarkets.
											Where else do you shop so religiously?
											Week in, week out.
											How much money do you spend,
in your life, in a supermarket?
											Love them.
											They just sell us what we want. All right.
											They owe us to put a food ambassador
in every major supermarket.
											They need to help us shop.
											They need to show us how to cook
quick, tasty, seasonal meals
											for people that are busy.
											This is not expensive.
											It is done in some, and it needs
to be done across the board
											in America soon, and quick.
											The big brands, you know, the food brands,

											With the fast-food industry

											I&#39;ve had loads

											That means that they can be
students, young parents,

around the basics of cooking,
											no matter what recession hits
them next time.
											If you can cook,
recession money doesn&#39;t matter.
											If you can cook, time doesn&#39;t matter.
											The workplace, we haven&#39;t

for corporate responsibility
											to really look at what they feed
or make available to their staff.
											The staff are the moms and dads

											Now, look, if we do
all this stuff, and we can,
											it&#39;s so achievable.
											You can care and be commercial.
											Absolutely.
											But the home needs to start passing on
cooking again, for sure.
											For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
											And for me, it&#39;s quite romantic,
											but it&#39;s about if one person
teaches three people
											how to cook something,
											and they teach three of their mates,
											that only has to repeat itself 25 times,
											and that&#39;s the whole
population of America.
											Romantic, yes, but most importantly,
											it&#39;s about trying to get people to realize
											that every one of your individual efforts
makes a difference.
											We&#39;ve got to put back what&#39;s been lost.
											Huntington&#39;s Kitchen.
											Huntington, where I made this program,

											Around America, if we just look back now,

things going on.
											There is plenty of beautiful
things going on.
											There are angels
around America doing great things
											in schools — farm-to-school set-ups,

											there are amazing people
doing this already.
											The problem is they all want to roll out

He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for inspiring people to eat fresh, honest, delicious food. While serving as sous chef at the River Cafe in London, the BBC took note of him. His series, <em>The Naked Chef</em>, debuted in 1999.

The Jamie Oliver Food Foundation trains young chefs from disadvantaged backgrounds to work in his restaurants and runs an extensive gardening program that teaches children where food comes from.

The winner of the 2010 TED Prize, he's on a mission to teach every family about eating better and living healthier lives. ","whylisten":"<p>Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father&#39;s pub. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for inspiring people to eat fresh, honest, delicious food. While serving as sous chef at the River Cafe in London, the BBC took note of him. His series, <em>The Naked Chef</em>, debuted in 1999. In the years since, he has built a worldwide media empire of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>As much as Oliver&#39;s cooking is generous, so is his business model. The Jamie Oliver Food Foundation trains young chefs from disadvantaged backgrounds to work in his restaurants and runs an extensive gardening program that teaches children where food comes from. Series like <em>Jamie&#39;s School Dinner</em>, <em>Jamie&#39;s Ministry of Food</em> and <em>Jamie Oliver&#39;s Food Revolution</em>&nbsp;combine his work in the kitchen with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.</p><p>Oliver uses his fame and charm to highlight the changes people need to make in their diet and lifestyles. With the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/food-revolution\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">2010 TED Prize</a>, he set the vision for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jamiesfoodrevolution.org/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open('','','');return false;\">Jamie&#39;s Food Revolution</a>, a global campaign to educate kids about food and inspire families to cook again. More than 750,000 people have signed up to be a part of it. At the same time, Oliver continues to advocate for policy changes, like sugar reduction and clearer food labeling.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jamie Oliver","tags":["business","education","food","global issues","health","obesity"],"title":"Teach every child about food","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":8162860}]}
