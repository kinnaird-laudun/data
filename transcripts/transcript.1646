<title>Charmian Gooch: My wish: To launch a new era of openness in business | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Anonymous companies protect corrupt individuals – from notorious drug cartel leaders to nefarious arms dealers – behind a shroud of mystery that makes it almost impossible to find and hold them responsible. But anti-corruption activist Charmian Gooch hopes to change all that. At TED2014, she shares her brave TED Prize wish: to know who owns and controls companies, to change the law, and to launch a new era of openness in business." />

									<p>
											I&#39;ve come here today
											to talk to you about a problem.
											It&#39;s a very simple yet devastating problem,
											one that spans the globe
											and is affecting all of us.
											The problem is
											anonymous companies.
											It sounds like a really dry and technical thing,
											doesn&#39;t it?
											But anonymous companies are making it difficult
											and sometimes impossible
											to find out
											the actual human beings responsible
											sometimes for really terrible crimes.
											So, why am I here talking to all of you?
											Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker
											and when my parents taught my twin brother and I
											to question authority,
											I don&#39;t think they knew where it might lead.
											(Laughter)
											And, they probably really regretted it
											during my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,
											I questioned their authority a lot.
											And a lot of my school teachers
											didn&#39;t appreciate it much either.
											You see, since the age of about five
											I&#39;ve always asked the question, but why?
											But why does the Earth go around the sun?
											But why is blood red?
											But why do I have to go to school?
											But why do I have to respect the teachers
											and authority?
											And little did I realize
											that this question would become the basis
											of everything I would do.
											And so it was
											in my twenties, a long time ago,
											that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London
											I was sitting with Simon Taylor
											and Patrick Alley
											and we were busy stuffing envelopes
											for a mail out in the office of the campaign group
											where we worked at the time.
											And as usual, we were talking 
about the world&#39;s problems.
											And in particular, we were talking about
											the civil war in Cambodia.
											And we had talked about that 
many, many times before.
											But then suddenly we stopped
											and looked at each other
											and said, but why don&#39;t we try and change this?
											And from that slightly crazy question,
											over two decades
											and many campaigns later,
											including alerting the world
											to the problem of blood diamonds funding war,
											from that crazy question,
											Global Witness is now an 80-strong team
											of campaigners, investigators, 
journalists and lawyers.
											And we&#39;re all driven by the same belief,
											that change really is possible.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, what exactly does Global Witness do?
											We investigate, we report,
											to uncover the people really responsible
											for funding conflict —
											for stealing millions from citizens around the world,
											also known as state looting,
											and for destroying the environment.
											And then we campaign hard to 
change the system itself.
											And we&#39;re doing this because 
so many of the countries
											rich in natural resources
											like oil or diamonds or timber
											are home to some of the poorest
											and most dispossessed people on the planet.
											And much of this injustice
											is made possible
											by currently accepted business practices.
											And one of these is anonymous companies.
											Now we&#39;ve come up against anonymous companies
											in lots of our investigations,
											like in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
											where we exposed how secretive deals
											involving anonymous companies
											had deprived the citizens
											of one of the poorest countries on the planet
											of well over a billion dollars.
											That&#39;s twice the country&#39;s health 
and education budget combined.
											Or in Liberia,
											where an international predatory logging company
											used front companies as it attempted to grab
											a really huge chunk of Liberia&#39;s unique forests.
											Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,
											which has led to the destruction 
of much of its forests.
											Well, that uses anonymous companies too.
											We secretly filmed some of the family
											of the former chief minister and a lawyer
											as they told our undercover investigator
											exactly how these dubious deals are done
											using such companies.
											And the awful thing is,
											there are so many other examples out there
											from all walks of life.
											This truly is a scandal of epic proportions
											hidden in plain sight.
											Whether it&#39;s the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,
											the Zetas,
											who use anonymous companies 
to launder profits
											while their drugs-related violence
											is tearing communities apart across the Americas.
											Or the anonymous company,
											which bought up Americans&#39; tax debts,
											piled on the legal fees
											and then gave homeowners a choice:
											Pay up or lose your home.
											Imagine being threatened with losing your home
											sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,
											and not being able to find out
											who you were really up against.

											Now anonymous companies
											are great for sanctions busting too.
											As the Iranian government found out
											when, through a series of front companies,
											it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,
											on Fifth Avenue,
											despite American sanctions.
											And Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,
											and other companies were the unwitting,
											unknowing tenants there.
											There are just so many examples,
											the horesemeat scandal in Europe,
											the Italian mafia, they&#39;ve used these companies
											for decades.
											The $100 million American Medicare fraud,
											the supply of weapons to wars around the world
											including those
											in Eastern Europe in the early &#39;90s.
											Anonymous companies
											have even come to light
											in the recent revolution in the Ukraine.

											But, for every case that we and others expose
											there are so many more that will remain hidden away
											because of the current system.
											And it&#39;s just a simple truth
											that some of the people responsible 
for outrageous crimes,
											for stealing from you and me
											and millions of others,
											they are remaining faceless
											and they are escaping accountability
											and they&#39;re doing this with ease,
											and they&#39;re doing it using legal structures.
											And really, that is unfair.
											Well, you might well ask,
											what exactly is an anonymous company,
											and can I really set one up, and use it,
											without anyone knowing who I am?
											Well, the answer is, yes you can.
											But if you&#39;re anything like me,
											you&#39;ll want to see some of that for yourself,
											so let me show you.
											Well first you need to work out
											where you want to set it up.
											Now, at this point you might be imagining
											one of those lovely tropical island tax havens
											but here&#39;s the thing,
											shockingly,
											my own hometown, London,
											and indeed the U.K.,
											is one of the best places in the world
											to set up an anonymous company.
											And the other, even better,
											I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s America.
											Do you know, in some states across America
											you need less identification
											to open up a company
											than you do to get a library card,
											like Delaware,
											which is one of the easiest places
											in the world to set up an anonymous company.

									<p>
											Okay, so let&#39;s say it&#39;s America,
											and let&#39;s say it&#39;s Delaware,
											and now you can simply go online
											and find yourself a company service provider.
											These are the companies that 
can set your one up for you,
											and remember, it&#39;s all legal,
routine business practice.
											So, here&#39;s one,
											but there are plenty of others to choose from.
											And having made your choice,
											you then pick what type of company you want
											and then fill in a contact, name and address.
											But don&#39;t worry,
											it doesn&#39;t have to be your name.
											It can be your lawyer&#39;s
											or your service provider&#39;s,
											and it&#39;s not for the public record anyway.
											And then you add the owner of the company.
											Now this is the key part,
											and again it doesn&#39;t have to be you,
											because you can get creative,
											because there is a whole universe 
out there of nominees
											to choose from.
											And nominees are the people that you
											can legally pay to be your company&#39;s owner.
											And if you don&#39;t want to involve anyone else,
											it doesn&#39;t even have to be an actual human being.
											It could be another company.
											And then finally,
											give your company a name
											add a few more details and make your payment.
											And then the service provider
											will take a few hours or more to process it.
											But there you are,
											in 10 minutes of online shopping
											you can create yourself an anonymous company.
											And not only is it easy,
											really, really easy and cheap,
											it&#39;s totally legal too.
											But the fun doesn&#39;t have to end there,
											maybe you want to be even more anonymous.
											Well, that&#39;s no problem either.
											You can simply keep adding layers,
											companies owned by companies.
											You can have hundreds of layers
											with hundreds of companies spread across
											lots of different countries,
											like a giant web,
											each layer adds anonymity.
											Each layer makes it more difficult
											for law enforcement and others
											to find out who the real owner is.
											But whose interests is this all serving?
											It might be in the interests of the company
											or a particular individual,
											but what about all of us, the public?
											There hasn&#39;t even been a global conversation yet
											about whether it&#39;s okay
											to misuse companies in this way.
											And what does it all mean for us?

											Well, an example that really haunts me
											is one I came across recently.
											And it&#39;s that of a horrific fire
											in a nightclub in Buenos Aires
											about a decade ago.
											It was the night before New Year&#39;s Eve.
											Three thousand very happy revelers,
											many of them teenagers,
											were crammed into a space meant for 1,000.
											And then tragedy struck,
											a fire broke out
											plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling
											and toxic smoke filled the club.
											So people tried to escape
											only to find that some of the fire doors
											had been chained shut.
											Over 200 people died.
											Seven hundred were injured trying to get out.
											And as the victims&#39; families 
and the city and the country
											reeled in shock,
											investigators tried to find out who was responsible.
											And as they looked for the owners of the club,
											they found instead anonymous companies,
											and confusion surrounded the identities of those
											involved with the companies.
											Now ultimately, a range of people were charged
											and some went to jail.
											But this was an awful tragedy,
											and it shouldn&#39;t have been so difficult
											just to try and find out who was responsible
											for those deaths.
											Because in an age
											when there is so much information
											out there in the open,
											why should this crucial information
											about company ownership
											stay hidden away?
											Why should tax evaders, corrupt 
government officials,
											arms traders and more,
											be able to hide their identities from us, the public?
											Why should this secrecy be such 
an accepted business practice?
											Anonymous companies
											might be the norm right now
											but it wasn&#39;t always this way.
											Companies were created
											to give people a chance to innovate
											and not have to put everything on the line.
											Companies were created to limit financial risk,
											they were never intended to 
be used as a moral shield.
											Companies were never intended to be anonymous,
											and they don&#39;t have to be.

									<p>
											And so I come to my wish.
											My wish is for us to know
											who owns and controls companies
											so that they can no longer be used anonymously
											against the public good.
											Together let&#39;s ignite world opinion,
											change the law,
											and launch a new era of openness in business.
											So what might this look like?
											Well, imagine if you could go online
											and look up the real owner of a company.
											Imagine if this data were open and free,
											accessible across borders
											for citizens and businesses
											and law enforcement alike.
											Imagine what a game changer that would be.
											So how are we going to do this?
											Well, there is only one way.
											Together, we have to change the law globally
											to create public registries
											which list the true owners of companies
											and can be accessed by all
											with no loopholes.
											And yes, this is ambitious,
											but there is momentum on this issue,
											and over the years I have seen
											the sheer power of momentum,
											and it&#39;s just starting on this issue.
											There is such an opportunity right now.
											And the TED community
											of creative and innovative thinkers and doers
											across all of society
											could make the crucial difference.
											You really can make this change happen.
											Now, a simple starting point
											is the address behind me
											for a Facebook page that you can join now
											to support the campaign and spread the word.
											It&#39;s going to be a springboard
											for our global campaigning.
											And the techies among you,
											you could really help us create a prototype
											public registry
											to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.
											Campaign groups from around the world
											have come together to work on this issue.
											The U.K. government is already on board;
											it supports these public registries.
											And just last week,
											the European Parliament came on board
											with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.
											That is momentum.
											(Applause)
											But it&#39;s early days.
											America still needs to come on board,
											as do so many other countries.
											And to succeed we will all together
											need to help and push our politicians,
											because without that,
											real far-reaching, world-shifting change
											just isn&#39;t going to happen.
											Because this isn&#39;t just about changing the law,
											this is about starting a conversation
											about what it&#39;s okay for companies to do,
											and in what ways is it acceptable 
to use company structures.
											This isn&#39;t just a dry policy issue.
											This is a human issue
											which affects us all.
											This is about being on the right side of history.
											Global citizens, innovators, 
business leaders, individuals,
											we need you.
											Together, let&#39;s kickstart this global movement.
											Let&#39;s just do it,
											let&#39;s end anonymous companies.
											Thank you.
											(Applause)
