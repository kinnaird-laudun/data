											Today I want to talk about design,
											but not design as we usually think about it.
											I want to talk about what is happening now
											in our scientific, biotechnological culture,
											where, for really the first time in history,
											we have the power to design bodies,
											to design animal bodies,
											to design human bodies.
											In the history of our planet,
											there have been three great waves of evolution.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The first wave of evolution
											is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.
											So, as you all know,
											species lived in particular ecological niches
											and particular environments,
											and the pressures of those environments
											selected which changes,
											through random mutation in species,
											were going to be preserved.
											Then human beings stepped out
											of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history
											and created the second great wave of evolution,
											which was we changed the environment
											in which we evolved.
											We altered our ecological niche
											by creating civilization.
											And that has been the second great —
											couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years —
											flow of our evolution.
											By changing our environment,
											we put new pressures
											on our bodies to evolve.
											Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,
											all the way through modern medicine,
											we have changed our own evolution.
											Now we&#39;re entering a third great wave
											of evolutionary history,
											which has been called many things:
											&quot;intentional evolution,&quot;
											&quot;evolution by design&quot; —
											very different than intelligent design —
											whereby we are actually now
											intentionally designing and altering
											the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that
											and then at the end talk a little bit
											about what some of the implications are for us
											and for our species, as well as our cultures,
											because of this change.
											Now we actually have been doing it for a long time.
											We started selectively breeding animals
											many, many thousands of years ago.
											And if you think of dogs for example,
											dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.
											There isn&#39;t a dog on this earth that&#39;s a natural creature.
											Dogs are the result
											of selectively breeding traits that we like.
											But we had to do it the hard way in the old days
											by choosing offspring that looked a particular way
											and then breeding them.
											We don&#39;t have to do it that way anymore.

											This is a beefalo.
											A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.
											And they are now making them,
											and someday, perhaps pretty soon,
											you will have beefalo patties
											in your local supermarket.
											This is a geep,
											a goat-sheep hybrid.
											The scientists that made this cute little creature
											ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.
											I think they said it tasted like chicken.
											This is a cama.
											A cama is a camel-llama hybrid,
											created to try to get the hardiness of a camel
											with some of the personality traits
											of a llama.
											And they are now using these in certain cultures.
											Then there&#39;s the liger.
											This is the largest cat in the world —
											the lion-tiger hybrid.
											It&#39;s bigger than a tiger.
											And in the case of the liger,
											there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.
											But these were created by scientists
											using both selective breeding and genetic technology.
											And then finally, everybody&#39;s favorite,
											the zorse.
											None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.
											And so one of the things we&#39;ve been doing
											is using genetic enhancement,
											or genetic manipulation,
											of normal selective breeding
											pushed a little bit through genetics.
											And if that were all this was about,
											then it would be an interesting thing.
											But something much, much more powerful
											is happening now.

											These are normal mammalian cells
											genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene
											taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.
											We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.
											Well, they&#39;ve now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,
											and put it into mammal cells.
											These are normal cells.
											And what you see here
											is these cells glowing in the dark
											under certain wavelengths of light.
											Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.
											So they did it with mouse pups,
											kittens.
											And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green
											is because that&#39;s a bioluminescent gene from coral,
											while this is from jellyfish.
											They did it with pigs.
											They did it with puppies.
											And, in fact,
											they did it with monkeys.
											And if you can do it with monkeys —
											though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate
											is actually between monkeys and apes —
											if they can do it in monkeys,
											they can probably figure out how to do it in apes,
											which means they can do it in human beings.
											In other words, it is theoretically possible
											that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable
											of creating human beings
											that glow in the dark.
											Be easier to find us at night.

											The salmon on top
											is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon,

											using a lot less feed.
											And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision

											And before you get too worried about it,

											These are all the first cloned animals

											So in the lower right here,
											you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep —

											Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat;
											CC the cat, for cloned cat;
											Snuppy, the first cloned dog —

											by the very same man that some of you may remember
											had to end up resigning in disgrace
											because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.
											He actually was the first person
											to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,
											because dog genomes are very plastic.
											This is Prometea, the first cloned horse.
											It&#39;s a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,
											a real &quot;gold ring&quot; of cloning,
											because there are many horses that win important races
											who are geldings.
											In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud
											has been removed.
											But if you can clone that horse,
											you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race
											and his identical genetic duplicate
											can then be put out to stud.
											These were the first cloned calves,
											the first cloned grey wolves,
											and then, finally,
											the first cloned piglets:
											Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.

											These are two creatures
											that were created
											in order to save endangered species.
											The guar
											is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.
											A somatic cell, a body cell,
											was taken from its body,
											gestated in the ovum of a cow,
											and then that cow gave birth to a guar.
											Same thing happened with the mouflon,
											where it&#39;s an endangered species of sheep.
											It was gestated in a regular sheep body,
											which actually raises an interesting biological problem.
											We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.
											We have our nucleic DNA
											that everybody thinks of as our DNA,
											but we also have DNA in our mitochondria,
											which are the energy packets of the cell.
											That DNA is passed down through our mothers.
											So really, what you end up having here
											is not a guar and not a mouflon,
											but a guar
											with cow mitochondria,
											and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,
											and a mouflon with another species of sheep&#39;s
											mitochondrial DNA.
											These are really hybrids, not pure animals.
											And it raises the question of how we&#39;re going to define animal species
											in the age of biotechnology —
											a question that we&#39;re not really sure yet
											how to solve.

											and it&#39;s on a big computer tracking ball.
											And now, using a joystick,
											they can send this creature
											around the lab
											and control whether it goes left or right,
											forwards or backwards.
											They&#39;ve created a kind of insect bot,
											or bugbot.
											It gets worse than that — or perhaps better than that.
											This actually is one of DARPA&#39;s very important —
											DARPA is the Defense Research Agency —
											one of their projects.
											These goliath beetles
											are wired in their wings.
											They have a computer chip strapped to their backs,
											and they can fly these creatures around the lab.
											They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.
											They can&#39;t actually make them land.

											There&#39;s also been work done with monkeys.
											This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.
											He took owl monkeys,
											wired them up
											so that a computer watched their brains while they moved,
											especially looking at the movement of their right arm.
											The computer learned what the monkey brain did
											to move its arm in various ways.
											They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,
											which you see here in the picture,
											put the arm in another room.
											Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey&#39;s brainwaves,
											to make that arm in the other room
											do whatever the monkey&#39;s arm did.
											Then he put a video monitor
											in the monkey&#39;s cage
											that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm,
											and the monkey got fascinated.
											The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm,
											this prosthetic arm would do.
											And eventually she was moving it and moving it,
											and eventually stopped moving her right arm
											and, staring at the screen,
											could move the prosthetic arm in the other room
											only with her brainwaves —
											which means that monkey
											became the first primate in the history of the world
											to have three independent functional arms.

											And it&#39;s not just technology
											that we&#39;re putting into animals.
											This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.
											He took 20,000 and then 60,000
											disaggregated rat neurons —
											so these are just individual neurons from rats —
											put them on a chip.
											They self-aggregated into a network,
											became an integrated chip.
											And he used that
											as the IT piece
											of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.
											So now we have organic computer chips
											made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.
											Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern
											took a completely intact,
											independent lamprey eel brain.
											This is a brain from a lamprey eel.
											It is living —
											fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium
											with these electrodes going off to the sides,
											attached photosensitive sensors to the brain,
											put it into a cart —
											here&#39;s the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle —
											and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,
											when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,
											the cart moves toward the light;
											when you turn it off, it moves away.
											It&#39;s photophilic.
											So now we have a complete
											living lamprey eel brain.
											Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,
											sitting there in its nutrient medium?
											I don&#39;t know,

											that we have managed to keep alive

											So, we are now at the stage

											This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti

											He altered this mouse
											so that it was genetically engineered
											to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,
											put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it
											and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse
											and transplanted onto a human being.

											Finally, not that long ago,
											Craig Venter created the first artificial cell,
											where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,
											which is a machine,
											created an artificial genome,
											put it in a different cell —
											the genome was not of the cell he put it in —
											and that cell then reproduced
											as the other cell.
											In other words,

											We can manipulate the plasmas of life

											and it confers on us a responsibility.
											Is everything okay?
											Is it okay to manipulate and create

											Do we have free reign
											to design animals?
											Do we get to go someday to Pets &#39;R&#39; Us
											and say, &quot;Look, I want a dog.
											I&#39;d like it to have the head of a Dachshund,
											the body of a retriever,
											maybe some pink fur,
											and let&#39;s make it glow in the dark&quot;?
											Does industry get to create creatures
											who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva
											and other bodily fluids,
											create the drugs and industrial molecules we want
											and then warehouse them
											as organic manufacturing machines?
											Do we get to create organic robots,
											where we remove the autonomy from these animals
											and turn them just into our playthings?

											And then the final step of this,
											once we perfect these technologies in animals
											and we start using them in human beings,
											what are the ethical guidelines
											that we will use then?
											It&#39;s already happening. It&#39;s not science fiction.
