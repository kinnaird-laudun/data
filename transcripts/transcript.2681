											OK, it&#39;s ridiculous to fire someone
for having the wrong personality,
											but here&#39;s the thing:
											at some point in your life,
											you probably fired yourself
for having the wrong personality.
											What I mean is, we opt
out of entire career paths,
											saying things like,
											&quot;I&#39;m not outgoing enough to be in sales&quot;
											and &quot;I just don&#39;t have the patience
to study to be a lawyer or a doctor.&quot;
											We decide not to pursue jobs that feel
like a stretch for our personalities.
											We close the door on opportunities
											and on ourselves.
											Personality is the set
of tendencies you carry with you,
											how friendly, assertive, hardworking,
curious and anxious you might be
											from one situation to another.
											There are way too many traits
to cover them all in this episode,
											so I&#39;m going to zoom in on one key trait
as an example throughout:
											introversion-extraversion.
											Of all of the major personality traits,
											it&#39;s the most widely studied
and the most visible.
											We can see signs of it at an early age.

											SC: Scientists have done
longitudinal studies
											where they follow people
throughout their lives,
											and they&#39;ve started with babies
as young as four days old.
											And they give sugar water
to these babies to suck on.
											And the thing is that sugar water
is a form of stimulation,
											just the way going
to a noisy party would be.
											And so what you find
is that the babies who salivate more
											in response to the sugar water —
											suggesting they have a more
activating kind of nervous system
											that reacts more
to all the inputs coming in —
											those same babies
are somewhat more likely,
											as they grow older,
to be more introverted.
											So those same babies
when they&#39;re two years old
											and you put them in a playgroup
of kids who they&#39;ve never seen before,
											they&#39;re more likely to react
to that scenario by freezing up
											and letting their
nervous systems settle down
											as they take in all
the new inputs coming at them.
											And it continues this way
throughout their lives.

											Hi, my name is Susan and I&#39;m an introvert.
											When I was in 8th grade,
we were studying &quot;Macbeth.&quot;
											I don&#39;t think the teacher knew
that I was kind of shy.
											She called me up to the front of the room
to improvise a scene

											and my friend Rob
was going to play Macbeth.
											And that was the kind of thing
that really triggered my shyness,
											and so I stood up in front of the room
and couldn&#39;t say a word, couldn&#39;t think,
											and so I just stood there gaping,
											and then a minute later
just sat back down and that was that,
											and I just felt incredibly ashamed
and humiliated by this.
											And after that my fear of public speaking
was intensified really
											for the next few decades.

by texting people throughout the day

were feeling at that moment

											It turned out that everyone
was more energized

											even the introverts.
											Introverts just get
overloaded more easily.
											Bright lights are brighter,
loud sounds are louder
											and loud people are a lot more annoying.
											Overload was a big concern for Susan,

finished writing her book,
											she knew she would have to overcome
her middle school fear

on the introverted end of the spectrum.

of the population is the opposite,

of all leaders and managers are.

actually make more effective leaders

of talking and listening.
