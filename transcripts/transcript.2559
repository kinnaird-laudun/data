<title>Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson: What AI is -- and isn&#39;t | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Educator and entrepreneur Sebastian Thrun wants us to use AI to free humanity of repetitive work and unleash our creativity. In an inspiring, informative conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Thrun discusses the progress of deep learning, why we shouldn&#39;t fear runaway AI and how society will be better off if dull, tedious work is done with the help of machines. &quot;Only one percent of interesting things have been invented yet,&quot; Thrun says. &quot;I believe all of us are insanely creative ... [AI] will empower us to turn creativity into action.&quot;" />

											Chris Anderson: Help us understand

											Sebastian Thrun: So, artificial
intelligence and machine learning
											is about 60 years old
											and has not had a great day
in its past until recently.
											And the reason is that today,
											we have reached a scale
of computing and datasets
											that was necessary to make machines smart.
											So here&#39;s how it works.
											If you program a computer today,
say, your phone,
											then you hire software engineers
											that write a very,
very long kitchen recipe,
											like, &quot;If the water is too hot,
turn down the temperature.
											If it&#39;s too cold, turn up
the temperature.&quot;
											The recipes are not just 10 lines long.
											They are millions of lines long.
											A modern cell phone
has 12 million lines of code.
											A browser has five million lines of code.
											And each bug in this recipe
can cause your computer to crash.
											That&#39;s why a software engineer
makes so much money.
											The new thing now is that computers
can find their own rules.
											So instead of an expert
deciphering, step by step,
											a rule for every contingency,
											what you do now is you give
the computer examples
											and have it infer its own rules.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											A really good example is AlphaGo,
which recently was won by Google.
											Normally, in game playing,
you would really write down all the rules,
											but in AlphaGo&#39;s case,
											the system looked over a million games
											and was able to infer its own rules
											and then beat the world&#39;s
residing Go champion.
											That is exciting, because it relieves
the software engineer
											of the need of being super smart,
											and pushes the burden towards the data.
											As I said, the inflection point
where this has become really possible —
											very embarrassing, my thesis
was about machine learning.
											It was completely
insignificant, don&#39;t read it,
											because it was 20 years ago
											and back then, the computers
were as big as a cockroach brain.
											Now they are powerful enough
to really emulate
											kind of specialized human thinking.
											And then the computers
take advantage of the fact
											that they can look at
much more data than people can.
											So I&#39;d say AlphaGo looked at
more than a million games.
											No human expert can ever
study a million games.
											Google has looked at over
a hundred billion web pages.
											No person can ever study
a hundred billion web pages.
											So as a result,
the computer can find rules
											that even people can&#39;t find.

											CA: So instead of looking ahead

											ST: Yeah. I mean, think about
how you raise children.
											You don&#39;t spend the first 18 years
giving kids a rule for every contingency
											and set them free
and they have this big program.
											They stumble, fall, get up,
they get slapped or spanked,
											and they have a positive experience,
a good grade in school,
											and they figure it out on their own.
											That&#39;s happening with computers now,
											which makes computer programming
so much easier all of a sudden.
											Now we don&#39;t have to think anymore.
We just give them lots of data.

into a spin-off called Voyage.

											We drive this road 20 times,

by a Facebook Fellow called Yann LeCun,
											and it propagates data stages
											through what you could think of
as the human brain.
											It&#39;s not quite the same thing,
but it emulates the same thing.
											It goes stage after stage.
											In the very first stage, it takes
the visual input and extracts edges
											and rods and dots.
											And the next one becomes
more complicated edges
											and shapes like little half-moons.
											And eventually, it&#39;s able to build
really complicated concepts.

											ST: This was last Thursday.
That&#39;s a moving piece.
											What we&#39;ve shown before and we published
in &quot;Nature&quot; earlier this year
											was this idea that we show
dermatologists images
											and our computer program images,
											and count how often they&#39;re right.
											But all these images are past images.
											They&#39;ve all been biopsied to make sure
we had the correct classification.
											This one wasn&#39;t.
											This one was actually done at Stanford
by one of our collaborators.
											The story goes that our collaborator,
											who is a world-famous dermatologist,
one of the three best, apparently,
											looked at this mole and said,
&quot;This is not skin cancer.&quot;
											And then he had
a second moment, where he said,
											&quot;Well, let me just check with the app.&quot;
											So he took out his iPhone
and ran our piece of software,
											our &quot;pocket dermatologist,&quot; so to speak,
											and the iPhone said: cancer.
											It said melanoma.
											And then he was confused.
											And he decided, &quot;OK, maybe I trust
the iPhone a little bit more than myself,&quot;
											and he sent it out to the lab
to get it biopsied.
											And it came up as an aggressive melanoma.
											So I think this might be the first time
that we actually found,
											in the practice of using deep learning,
											an actual person whose melanoma
would have gone unclassified,
											had it not been for deep learning.

an army of students
											who participate in competitions.
											We&#39;re not the only ones
who use crowdsourcing.
											Uber and Didi use crowdsource for driving.
											Airbnb uses crowdsourcing for hotels.
											There&#39;s now many examples
where people do bug-finding crowdsourcing

											ST: Yeah, I mean, as you followed
the fantastic panels yesterday morning,
											two sessions about AI,
											robotic overlords and the human response,
											many, many great things were said.

that we sometimes confuse
											what&#39;s actually been done with AI

consciousness, right?

											AI has always been
an augmentation of people.
											It&#39;s been an augmentation of us,
											to make us stronger.
											And I think Kasparov was exactly correct.
											It&#39;s been the combination
of human smarts and machine smarts
											that make us stronger.
											The theme of machines making us stronger
is as old as machines are.
											The agricultural revolution took
place because it made steam engines

that couldn&#39;t farm by itself,

it made us stronger.

											CA: We&#39;ll come on to that a bit more,

of this for some people,
											like, what feels like it gets
scary for people is when you have
											a computer that can, one,
rewrite its own code,
											so, it can create
multiple copies of itself,
											try a bunch of different code versions,
											possibly even at random,

on an intelligence test.

											In the AlphaGo case,
we had exactly this thing:

the game against itself

the thing that&#39;s on my mind these days,

is something else.
											Everything successful in AI
to the present date
											has been extremely specialized,
											and it&#39;s been thriving on a single idea,
											which is massive amounts of data.

is because of massive numbers of Go plays,

											thrives on massive amounts of data,
and it can&#39;t do anything else.
											It can&#39;t even control a motorcycle.
											It&#39;s a very specific,
domain-specific function,
											and the same is true for our cancer app.
											There has been almost no progress
on this thing called &quot;general AI,&quot;

past progress and the benefit of it,
											like our iPhones or our planes
or electricity or medical supply.
											We all love to live to 80,
which was impossible 300 years ago.
											But we kind of don&#39;t apply
the same rules to the future.
											So if I look at my own job as a CEO,
											I would say 90 percent
of my work is repetitive,
											I don&#39;t enjoy it,
											I spend about four hours per day
on stupid, repetitive email.
											And I&#39;m burning to have something
that helps me get rid of this.
											Why?
											Because I believe all of us
are insanely creative;
											I think the TED community
more than anybody else.
											But even blue-collar workers;
I think you can go to your hotel maid
											and have a drink with him or her,
											and an hour later,
you find a creative idea.
											What this will empower
is to turn this creativity into action.
											Like, what if you could
build Google in a day?
											What if you could sit over beer
and invent the next Snapchat,
											whatever it is,
											and tomorrow morning it&#39;s up and running?

									<p>
											And that is not science fiction.
											What&#39;s going to happen is,
											we are already in history.
											We&#39;ve unleashed this amazing creativity
											by de-slaving us from farming
											and later, of course, from factory work
											and have invented so many things.
											It&#39;s going to be even better,
in my opinion.
											And there&#39;s going to be
great side effects.
											One of the side effects will be
											that things like food and medical supply
and education and shelter
											and transportation
											will all become much more
affordable to all of us,
											not just the rich people.

											CA: Hmm.
											So when Martin Ford argued, you know,
that this time it&#39;s different
											because the intelligence
that we&#39;ve used in the past
											to find new ways to be
											will be matched at the same pace
											by computers taking over those things,
											what I hear you saying
is that, not completely,
											because of human creativity.
											Do you think that that&#39;s fundamentally
different from the kind of creativity
											that computers can do?

											ST: So, that&#39;s my firm
belief as an AI person —
											that I haven&#39;t seen
any real progress on creativity
											and out-of-the-box thinking.
											What I see right now — and this is
really important for people to realize,
											because the word &quot;artificial
intelligence&quot; is so threatening,
											and then we have Steve Spielberg
tossing a movie in,
											where all of a sudden
the computer is our overlord,
											but it&#39;s really a technology.
											It&#39;s a technology that helps us
do repetitive things.
											And the progress has been
entirely on the repetitive end.
											It&#39;s been in legal document discovery.
											It&#39;s been contract drafting.
											It&#39;s been screening X-rays of your chest.
											And these things are so specialized,
											I don&#39;t see the big threat of humanity.
											In fact, we as people —
											I mean, let&#39;s face it:
we&#39;ve become superhuman.
											We&#39;ve made us superhuman.
											We can swim across
the Atlantic in 11 hours.
											We can take a device out of our pocket
											and shout all the way to Australia,
											and in real time, have that person
shouting back to us.
											That&#39;s physically not possible.
We&#39;re breaking the rules of physics.
											When this is said and done,
we&#39;re going to remember everything
											we&#39;ve ever said and seen,
											you&#39;ll remember every person,
											which is good for me
in my early stages of Alzheimer&#39;s.
											Sorry, what was I saying? I forgot.

											ST: And think about this:
											if you look at the history of humanity,
											that might be whatever —
60-100,000 years old, give or take —
											almost everything that you cherish
in terms of invention,
											of technology, of things we&#39;ve built,
											has been invented in the last 150 years.
											If you toss in the book and the wheel,
it&#39;s a little bit older.
											Or the axe.
											But your phone, your sneakers,
											these chairs, modern
manufacturing, penicillin —
											the things we cherish.
											Now, that to me means
											the next 150 years will find more things.
											In fact, the pace of invention
has gone up, not gone down, in my opinion.
											I believe only one percent of interesting
things have been invented yet. Right?
											We haven&#39;t cured cancer.
											We don&#39;t have flying cars — yet.
Hopefully, I&#39;ll change this.
											That used to be an example
people laughed about. (Laughs)
											It&#39;s funny, isn&#39;t it?
Working secretly on flying cars.
											We don&#39;t live twice as long yet. OK?
											We don&#39;t have this magic
implant in our brain
											that gives us the information we want.
											And you might be appalled by it,
											but I promise you,
once you have it, you&#39;ll love it.
											I hope you will.
											It&#39;s a bit scary, I know.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_thrun_and_chris_anderson_the_new_generation_of_computers_is_programming_itself","viewed_count":1370154,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"Sebsatian Thrun recommends","blurb":"Further reading curated by Sebastian Thrun","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":"","type":"recommendation","rec_lists":[{"title":"","description":"","rec_items":[{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* (3rd Edition)","blurb":"","note":"Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig\r\nPearson, 2009","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Deep Learning* (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)","blurb":"","note":"Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville\r\nThe MIT Press, 2016","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"EXPLORE","headline":"Deep Learning nanodegree","blurb":"","note":"Udacity","link_url":"https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"EXPLORE","headline":"Intro to Self-Driving Cars","blurb":"","note":"Udacity","link_url":"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""}]}]},"more_resources":[],"corrections":[],"has_citations":false,"take_action":[],"curator_approved":true,"description":"Educator and entrepreneur Sebastian Thrun wants us to use AI to free humanity of repetitive work and unleash our creativity.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson","tags":["AI","cancer","algorithm","computers","creativity","collaboration","driverless cars","data","future","entrepreneur","innovation","interview","invention","intelligence","motivation","society","potential","software","technology","work"],"title":"What AI is -- and isn't","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1370154}]}
