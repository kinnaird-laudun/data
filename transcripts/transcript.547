											Once upon a time,
											at the age of 24,
											I was a student at St. John&#39;s Medical College in Bangalore.
											I was a guest student during one month
											of a public health course.
											And that changed my mindset forever.
											The course was good, but it was not the course content
											in itself that changed the mindset.
											It was the brutal realization,
											the first morning,
											that the Indian students were better than me.

											You see, I was a study nerd.
											I loved statistics from a young age.
											And I studied very much in Sweden.
											I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended.
											But in St. John&#39;s, I was in the lower quarter.
											And the fact was that Indian students
											studied harder than we did in Sweden.
											They read the textbook twice,
											or three times or four times.
											In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.

											And that, to me,
											that personal experience
											was the first time in my life
											that the mindset I grew up with
											was changed.
											And I realized that perhaps
											the Western world will not continue
											to dominate the world forever.
											And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.
											It&#39;s that realization of someone you meet
											that really made you change your ideas about the world.
											It&#39;s not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.

											And I will now,
											here, onstage,
											try to predict when that will happen —
											that Asia will regain
											its dominant position
											as the leading part of the world,
											as it used to be, over thousands of years.
											And I will do that
											by trying to predict precisely
											at what year
											the average income per person
											in India, in China, will reach that of the West.
											And I don&#39;t mean the whole economy,
											because to grow an economy
											of India to the size of U.K. —
											that&#39;s a piece of cake, with one billion people.
											But I want to see when will the average pay, the money
											for each person, per month,
											in India and China,
											when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?

											But I will start with a historical background.
											And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?
											I will start at 1858.
											1858 was a year of great technological
											advancement in the West.
											That was the year when Queen Victoria
											was able, for the first time, to communicate
											with President Buchanan,
											through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.
											And they were the first to &quot;Twitter&quot; transatlantically.
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											And I&#39;ve been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,
											to find the text of the telegram
											sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.
											And it ends like this: &quot;This telegraph
											is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,
											civilization, liberty and law throughout the world.&quot;

											Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious
											of what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom.
											And we will think about that
											when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858.
											Because 1858
											was also watershed year
											in the history of Asia.
											1858 was the year
											when the courageous uprising
											against the foreign occupation of India
											was defeated by the British forces.
											And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination.

											1858 in China

											And we will see, you know.
											Look here, 1858, India was here,
											China was here, Japan was there,
											United States and United Kingdom
											was richer over there.
											And I will start the world like this.
											India was not always like this level.
											Actually if we go back into the historical record,
											there was a time hundreds of years ago
											when the income per person in India and China
											was even above that of Europe.
											But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination,
											and India had been de-industrialized.
											And you can see that the countries who were growing
											their economy was United States and United Kingdom.
											And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy,
											and Japan was starting to catch up.
											India was trying down here.
											Can you see how it starts to move there?
											But really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan.
											And Japan is trying to move up there.

											And it&#39;s the new century now. Health is getting better,
											United Kingdom, United States.
											But careful now — we are approaching the First World War.
											And the First World War, you know,
											we&#39;ll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.
											United Kingdom is going down.
											And now comes the Spanish flu also.
											And then after the First World War, they continue up.
											Still under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,
											India and China are down in the corner.
											Not much has happened.
											They have grown their population but not much more.
											In the 1930&#39;s now, you can see
											that Japan is going to a period of war,
											with lower life expectancy.
											And the Second World War was really a terrible event,
											also economically for Japan.
											But they did recover quite fast afterwards.
											And we are moving into the new world.
											In 1947 India finally
											gained its independence.
											And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,

											You can see that the health started to improve.
											Children started to go to school.
											Health services were provided.
											This is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.
											It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.
											China recovered. Then they said,
											&quot;Nevermore, stupid central planning.&quot;
											But they went up here, and India was trying to follow.
											And they were catching up indeed.

											And he said, &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter
											if a cat is white or black,

											Because catching mice
											is what the two cats wanted to do.
											And you can see the two cats being here,
											China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.
											And they decided to go not only for health and education,
											but also starting to grow their economy.
											And the market reformer was successful there.
											In &#39;92 India follows with a market reform.

											Shanghai is already there.
											And it&#39;s healthier than the United States.
											But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest
											inland provinces of China, is there.
											And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,

											And if I would also look at India,
											you have another type of inequity, actually, in India.
											The geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.
											Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,
											is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.
											Kerala is flying on top there,
											matching United States in health,
											but not in economy.
											And here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,
											is forging forward.
											Now in India, the big inequities are within the state,
											rather than between the states.
											And that is not a bad thing, in itself.
											If you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities
											can be more difficult in the long term to deal with,

											My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this

											And I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.
											is so rich over there

											And then time here, from 1858
											I start the world.
											And we shall see what will happen with these countries.
											You see, China under foreign domination
											actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.
											Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.
											And after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.
											But independence is coming here.

											Now, the question is, &quot;When will the catch up take place?&quot;
											Look at, look at the United States.
											Can you see the bubble?
											The bubbles, not my bubbles,
											but the financial bubbles.
											That&#39;s the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there.
											You see it came down there.
											And it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know.
											So they doesn&#39;t seem to go this way, these countries.
											They seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know.
											And people interested in growth

											I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up.
											You see, Japan did it like that.
											We add Japan to it.
											And there is no doubt that fast catch up
											can take place.
											Can you see here what Japan did?
											Japan did it like this, until full catch up,
											and then they follow with the other high-income economies.
											But the real projections for those ones,
											I would like to give it like this.
											Can be worse, can be better.
											It&#39;s always difficult to predict, especially about the future.
											Now, a historian tells me it&#39;s even more difficult to predict about the past.

											I think I&#39;m in a difficult position here.
											Inequalities in China and India
											I consider really the big obstacle
											because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity
											is what will create a domestic market,
											what will avoid social instability,
											and which will make use of the entire capacity
											of the population.
											So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,

											You know the climate. We have great international experts

											otherwise China and India would be the countries
											most to suffer from climate change.
											And I consider India and China the best partners in the world

											But what I&#39;m really worried about is war.
											Will the former rich countries really accept
											a completely changed world economy,
											and a shift of power away from where it has been
											the last 50 to 100 to 150 years,
											back to Asia?
											And will Asia be able to handle that
											new position of being in charge
											of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?
											So, always avoid war,
											because that always pushes human beings backward.
											Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,
											get ready for a world in equity,

Global trends in health and economics come to vivid life. And the big picture of global development—with some surprisingly good news—snaps into sharp focus.","whylisten":"<p>Even the most worldly and well-traveled among us have had their perspectives shifted by Hans Rosling. A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\" target=\"_blank\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his work focused on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (as he pointed out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What set Rosling apart wasn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presented them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. A presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations were grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations and World Bank data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling took this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.gapminder.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />Hans Rosling passed away in February 2017. He is greatly missed.<br /><br /><br /> </p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_asia_s_rise_how_and_when","viewed_count":1807400,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"Hans Rosling was a young guest student in India when he first realized that Asia had all the capacities to reclaim its place as the world's dominant economic force.

Global trends in health and economics come to vivid life. And the big picture of global development—with some surprisingly good news—snaps into sharp focus.","whylisten":"<p>Even the most worldly and well-traveled among us have had their perspectives shifted by Hans Rosling. A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\" target=\"_blank\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his work focused on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (as he pointed out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What set Rosling apart wasn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presented them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. A presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations were grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations and World Bank data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling took this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.gapminder.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />Hans Rosling passed away in February 2017. He is greatly missed.<br /><br /><br /> </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Hans Rosling","tags":["Asia","economics","health","india","statistics","technology","visualizations"],"title":"Asia's rise -- how and when","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1807400}]}
