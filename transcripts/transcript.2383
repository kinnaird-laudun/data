											EM: Yeah.
											I ask myself that frequently.
											We&#39;re trying to dig a hole under LA,
											and this is to create the beginning
											of what will hopefully
be a 3D network of tunnels
											to alleviate congestion.
											So right now, one of the most
soul-destroying things is traffic.
											It affects people
in every part of the world.
											It takes away so much of your life.
											It&#39;s horrible.
											It&#39;s particularly horrible in LA.

											EM: Yeah, absolutely.
So this is the first time —
											Just to show what we&#39;re talking about.
											So a couple of key things
that are important
											in having a 3D tunnel network.
											First of all, you have to be able
											to integrate the entrance
and exit of the tunnel
											seamlessly into the fabric of the city.
											So by having an elevator,
											sort of a car skate,
that&#39;s on an elevator,
											you can integrate the entrance
and exits to the tunnel network
											just by using two parking spaces.
											And then the car gets on a skate.
											There&#39;s no speed limit here,
											so we&#39;re designing this to be able
to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.

											EM: So, I don&#39;t know
if people noticed it in the video,

to how many levels of tunnel you can have.
											You can go much further deep
than you can go up.
											The deepest mines are much deeper
than the tallest buildings are tall,
											so you can alleviate any arbitrary
level of urban congestion
											with a 3D tunnel network.
											This is a very important point.
											So a key rebuttal to the tunnels
is that if you add one layer of tunnels,
											that will simply alleviate congestion,
it will get used up,
											and then you&#39;ll be back where you started,
back with congestion.
											But you can go to any
arbitrary number of tunnels,
											any number of levels.

the LA subway extension,

											So it&#39;s roughly a billion dollars a mile
to do the subway extension in LA.
											And this is not the highest

to dig tunnels normally.

											EM: Actually, if you just do two things,
											you can get to approximately
an order of magnitude improvement,
											and I think you can go beyond that.
											So the first thing to do
is to cut the tunnel diameter
											by a factor of two or more.
											So a single road lane tunnel
according to regulations
											has to be 26 feet,
maybe 28 feet in diameter
											to allow for crashes
and emergency vehicles
											and sufficient ventilation
for combustion engine cars.
											But if you shrink that diameter
to what we&#39;re attempting,
											which is 12 feet, which is plenty
to get an electric skate through,
											you drop the diameter by a factor of two
											and the cross-sectional area
by a factor of four,
											and the tunneling cost scales
with the cross-sectional area.
											So that&#39;s roughly a half-order
of magnitude improvement right there.
											Then tunneling machines currently tunnel
for half the time, then they stop,
											and then the rest of the time
is putting in reinforcements
											for the tunnel wall.
											So if you design the machine instead
											to do continuous
tunneling and reinforcing,
											that will give you
a factor of two improvement.
											Combine that and that&#39;s a factor of eight.
											Also these machines are far from being
at their power or thermal limits,
											so you can jack up the power
to the machine substantially.
											I think you can get
at least a factor of two,
											maybe a factor of four or five
improvement on top of that.
											So I think there&#39;s a fairly
straightforward series of steps
											to get somewhere in excess
of an order of magnitude improvement
											in the cost per mile,
											and our target actually is —
											we&#39;ve got a pet snail called Gary,
											this is from Gary the snail
from &quot;South Park,&quot;

to go underground the entire way

											You&#39;re going under
a lot of buildings and houses,

											you cannot detect the tunnel.
											Sometimes people think,
well, it&#39;s going to be pretty annoying
											to have a tunnel dug under my house.
											Like, if that tunnel is dug
											more than about three or four
tunnel diameters beneath your house,
											you will not be able
to detect it being dug at all.

to detect the tunnel being dug,
											whatever device you are using,
											you can get a lot of money
for that device from the Israeli military,
											who is trying to detect
tunnels from Hamas,

that try and detect drug tunnels.
											So the reality is
											that earth is incredibly good
at absorbing vibrations,

is below a certain level,
											it is undetectable.

											EM: I think there&#39;s —
											I look at the future
from the standpoint of probabilities.
											It&#39;s like a branching
stream of probabilities,
											and there are actions that we can take
that affect those probabilities
											or that accelerate one thing
or slow down another thing.
											I may introduce something new
to the probability stream.
											Sustainable energy
will happen no matter what.
											If there was no Tesla,
if Tesla never existed,
											it would have to happen out of necessity.
											It&#39;s tautological.
											If you don&#39;t have sustainable energy,
it means you have unsustainable energy.
											Eventually you will run out,
											and the laws of economics
will drive civilization
											towards sustainable energy,
											inevitably.
											The fundamental value
of a company like Tesla
											is the degree to which it accelerates
the advent of sustainable energy,
											faster than it would otherwise occur.

											So when I think, like,
											what is the fundamental good
of a company like Tesla,
											I would say, hopefully,
											if it accelerated that by a decade,
potentially more than a decade,
											that would be quite a good thing to occur.
											That&#39;s what I consider to be
											the fundamental
aspirational good of Tesla.

									<p>
											Then there&#39;s becoming a multiplanet
species and space-faring civilization.
											This is not inevitable.
											It&#39;s very important to appreciate
this is not inevitable.
											The sustainable energy future
I think is largely inevitable,
											but being a space-faring civilization
is definitely not inevitable.
											If you look at the progress in space,
											in 1969 you were able
to send somebody to the moon.
											1969.
											Then we had the Space Shuttle.
											The Space Shuttle could only
take people to low Earth orbit.
											Then the Space Shuttle retired,
											and the United States
could take no one to orbit.
											So that&#39;s the trend.
											The trend is like down to nothing.
											People are mistaken when they think
											that technology
just automatically improves.
											It does not automatically improve.
											It only improves if a lot of people
work very hard to make it better,
											and actually it will, I think,
by itself degrade, actually.
											You look at great civilizations
like Ancient Egypt,
											and they were able to make the pyramids,
											and they forgot how to do that.
											And then the Romans,
they built these incredible aqueducts.
											They forgot how to do it.

											CA: Elon, it almost seems,
listening to you

things you&#39;ve done,

double motivation on everything
											that I find so interesting.
											One is this desire to work
for humanity&#39;s long-term good.
											The other is the desire
to do something exciting.
											And often it feels like you feel
like you need the one to drive the other.
											With Tesla, you want
to have sustainable energy,

exciting cars to do it.

											so we need to make these beautiful roofs.
											We haven&#39;t even spoken
