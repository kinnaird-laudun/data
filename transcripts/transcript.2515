<title>Margrethe Vestager: The new age of corporate monopolies | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Margrethe Vestager wants to keep European markets competitive -- which is why, on behalf of the EU, she&#39;s fined Google $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules, asked Apple for $15.3 billion in back taxes and investigated a range of companies, from Gazprom to Fiat, for anti-competitive practices. In an important talk about the state of the global business, she explains why markets need clear rules -- and how even the most innovative companies can become a problem when they become too dominant. &quot;Real and fair competition has a vital role to play in building the trust we need to get the best of our societies,&quot; Vestager says. &quot;And that starts with enforcing our rules.&quot;" />

<meta content='Margrethe Vestager wants to keep European markets competitive — which is why, on behalf of the EU, she&#x0027;s fined Google $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules, asked Apple for $15.3 billion in back taxes and investigated a range of companies, from Gazprom to Fiat, for anti-competitive practices. In an important talk about the state of the global business, she explains why markets need clear rules — and how even the most innovative companies can become a problem when they become too dominant. "Real and fair competition has a vital role to play in building the trust we need to get the best of our societies," Vestager says. "And that starts with enforcing our rules."' itemprop='description'>

											Let&#39;s go back to 1957.
											Representatives
from six European countries
											had come to Rome
											to sign the treaty that was
to create the European Union.
											Europe was destroyed.
											A world war had emerged from Europe.
											The human suffering was unbelievable
											and unprecedented.
											Those men
											wanted to create a peaceful,
											democratic Europe,
											a Europe that works for its people.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And one of the many building blocks
											in that peace project
											was a common European market.
											Already back then,
											they saw how markets,
											when left to themselves,
											can sort of slip into being
just the private property
											of big businesses and cartels,
											meeting the needs of some businesses
											and not the needs of customers.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So from our very first day,
											in 1957,
											the European Union had rules
											to defend fair competition.
											And that means competition on the merits,
											that you compete
on the quality of your products,
											the prices you can offer,
											the services, the innovation
that you produce.
											That&#39;s competition on the merits.
											You have a fair chance
of making it on such a market.
											And it&#39;s my job,
											as Commissioner for Competition,
											to make sure that companies
who do business in Europe
											live by those rules.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But let&#39;s take a step back.
											Why do we need rules
on competition at all?
											Why not just let businesses compete?
											Isn&#39;t that also the best for us
											if they compete freely,
											since more competition
											drives more quality,
											lower prices, more innovation?
											Well, mostly it is.
											But the problem is
that sometimes, for businesses,
											competition can be inconvenient,
											because competition means
that the race is never over,
											the game is never won.
											No matter how well
you were doing in the past,
											there&#39;s always someone
											who are out there
wanting to take your place.
											So the temptation to avoid competition
											is powerful.
											It&#39;s rooted in motives
as old as Adam and Eve:
											in greed for yet more money,
											in fear of losing
your position in the market
											and all the benefits it brings.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And when greed and fear
											are linked to power,
											you have a dangerous mix.
											We see that in political life.
											In part of the world,
											the mix of greed and fear
											means that those who get power
											become reluctant to give it back.
											One of the many things
											I like and admire in our democracies
											are the norms
											that make our leaders hand over power
											when voters tell them to.
											And competition rules
can do a similar thing in the market,
											making sure that greed and fear
doesn&#39;t overcome fairness.
											Because those rules mean
											that companies cannot misuse their power
to undermine competition.

											Think for a moment about your car.
											It has thousands of parts,
											from the foam that makes the seats
											to the electrical wiring
to the light bulbs.
											And for many of those parts,
											the world&#39;s carmakers,
											they are dependent
on only a few suppliers.
											So it&#39;s hardly surprising
											that it is kind of tempting
for those suppliers
											to come together and fix prices.
											But just imagine what that could do
											to the final price
of your new car in the market.
											Except, it&#39;s not imaginary.
											The European Commission
											has dealt with already
seven different car parts cartels,
											and we&#39;re still investigating some.
											Here, the Department of Justice
											are also looking
into the market for car parts,
											and it has called it
the biggest criminal investigation
											it has ever pursued.
											But without competition rules,
											there would be no investigation,
											and there would be nothing
to stop this collusion from happening
											and the prices of your car to go up.

											Yet it&#39;s not only companies
											who can undermine fair competition.
											Governments can do it, too.
											And governments do that
when they hand out subsidies
											to just the favorite few, the selected.
											They may do that
when they hand out subsidies —
											and, of course,
all financed by taxpayers —
											to companies.
											That may be in the form
of special tax treatments,
											like the tax benefits
											that firms like Fiat,
Starbucks and Apple got
											from some governments in Europe.
											Those subsidies stop companies
from competing on equal terms.
											They can mean that
the companies that succeed,
											well, they are the companies
that got the most subsidy,
											the ones that are the best-connected,
											and not, as it should be,
											the companies that serve
consumers the best.
											So there are times when we need to step in
											to make sure that competition
works the way it should.
											By doing that, we help
the market to work fairly,
											because competition gives consumers
the power to demand a fair deal.
											It means that companies know
that if they cannot offer good prices
											or the service that&#39;s expected,
											well, the customers
will go somewhere else.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And that sort of fairness
is more important
											than we may sometimes realize.
											Very few people think
about politics all the time.
											Some even skip it at election time.
											But we are all in the market.
											Every day, we are in the market.
											And we don&#39;t want businesses
to agree on prices in the back office.
											We don&#39;t want them
to divide the market between them.
											We don&#39;t want one big company
											just to shut out competitors
											from ever showing us what they can do.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											If that happens,
											well, obviously, we feel
that someone has cheated us,
											that we are being ignored
or taken for granted by the market.
											And that may undermine
not only our trust in the market
											but also our trust in the society.
											In a recent survey,
											more than two-thirds of Europeans
											said that they had felt
the effects of lack of competition:
											that the price
for electricity was too high,
											that the price for the medicines
they needed was too high,
											that they had no real choice
											if they wanted to travel
by bus or by plane,
											or they got poor service
from their internet provider.
											In short, they found that the market
didn&#39;t treat them fairly.
											And that might seem
like very small things,
											but they can give you this sense
											that the world isn&#39;t really fair.
											And they see the market,
which was supposed to serve everyone,
											become more like the private property
of a few powerful companies.

									<p>
											The market is not the society.
											Our societies are, of course,
much, much more than the market.
											But lack of trust in the market
											can rub off on society
											so we lose trust in our society as well.
											And it may be the most important
thing we have, trust.
											We can trust each other
if we are treated as equals.
											If we are all to have the same chances,
											well, we all have to follow
the same fundamental rules.
											Of course, some people and some businesses
are more successful than others,
											but we do not trust in a society
											if the prizes are handed out
											even before the contest begins.

											And this is where
competition rules come in,
											because when we make sure
that markets work fairly,
											then businesses compete on the merits,
											and that helps to build the trust
that we need as citizens
											to feel comfortable and in control,
											and the trust that allows
our society to work.
											Because without trust,
everything becomes harder.
											Just to live our daily lives,
we need to trust in strangers,
											to trust the banks who keep our money,
											the builders who build our home,
											the electrician
who comes to fix the wiring,
											the doctor who treats us when we&#39;re ill,
											not to mention
the other drivers on the road,
											and everyone knows that they are crazy.
											And yet, we have to trust them
											to do the right thing.
											And the thing is
that the more our societies grow,
											the more important trust becomes
											and the harder it is to build.
											And that is a paradox of modern societies.
											And this is especially true
											when technology changes
the way that we interact.
											Of course, to some degree,
technology can help us
											to build trust in one another
with ratings systems and other systems
											that enable the sharing economy.
											But technology also creates
completely new challenges
											when they ask us
not to trust in other people
											but to trust in algorithms and computers.

									<p>
											Of course, we all see
and share and appreciate
											all the good that
new technology can do us.
											It&#39;s a lot of good.
											Autonomous cars can give people
with disabilities new independence.
											It can save us all time,
											and it can make a much, much
better use of resources.
											Algorithms that rely on crunching
enormous amounts of data
											can enable our doctors
to give us a much better treatment,
											and many other things.
											But no one is going
to hand over their medical data
											or step into a car
that&#39;s driven by an algorithm
											unless they trust the companies
that they are dealing with.
											And that trust isn&#39;t always there.
											Today, for example,
less than a quarter of Europeans
											trust online businesses
to protect their personal information.

											But what if people knew
											that they could rely
on technology companies
											to treat them fairly?
											What if they knew that those companies
											respond to competition
by trying to do better,
											by trying to serve consumers better,
											not by using their power
											to shut out competitors,
											say, by pushing their services
											far, far down the list of search results
											and promoting themselves?
											What if they knew
that compliance with the rules
											was built into the algorithms by design,
											that the algorithm had to go
to competition rules school
											before they were ever allowed to work,
											that those algorithms were designed
											in a way that meant
that they couldn&#39;t collude,
											that they couldn&#39;t form
their own little cartel

											Together with regulation,
											competition rules can do that.
											They can help us to make sure
											that new technology treats people fairly
											and that everyone can compete
on a level playing field.
											And that can help us build the trust
											that we need for real innovation
											to flourish
											and for societies to develop for citizens.
											Because trust cannot be imposed.
											It has to be earned.

											Since the very first days
of the European Union,

											A lot of things have changed.
											It&#39;s hard to say
what those six representatives
											would have made of a smartphone.
											But in today&#39;s world,
											as well as in their world,
											competition makes the market
work for everyone.
											And that is why I am convinced
											that real and fair competition
											has a vital role to play
											in building the trust we need
											to get the best of our societies,
											and that starts with enforcing our rules,
											actually just to make
the market work for everyone.

											BG: I want to ask you two questions.

											MV: Well, yes, it is
definitely challenging us,
											because we both have to sharpen our tools
											but also to develop new tools.
											When we were going through
the Google responses
											to our statement of objection,
											we were going through
5.2 terabytes of data.
											It&#39;s quite a lot.
											So we had to set up new systems.
											We had to figure out how to do this,
											because you cannot work
the way you did just a few years ago.
											So we are definitely
sharpening up our working methods.
											The other thing is
that we try to distinguish
											between different kinds of data,
											because some data is extremely valuable
											and they will form, like,
a barrier to entry in a market.
											Other things you can just —
it loses its value tomorrow.
											So we try to make sure
											that we never, ever underestimate the fact
											that data works
as a currency in the market
											and as an asset that can be
a real barrier for competition.

											Google appealed the case.
The case is going to court.
											It will last a while.
											Earlier, last year, you asked Apple
to pay 13 billion in back taxes,

As Commissioner for Competition for the European Union, Vestager is in charge of regulating commercial activity across the 28 member states and enforcing the EU&#39;s rules designed to keep the markets fair -- rules that, she believes, some big companies have been abusing. In 2016, Vestager&nbsp;ordered Apple to pay &euro;13 bn (about US$15.3 bn) in back taxes. In June 2017, she fined Google &euro;2.4 bn (US$2.8 bn) for manipulating search results in favor of its own services. Other antitrust cases are open against Google. Facebook, Amazon, Russian natural gas producer Gazprom, Italian carmaker Fiat and others are also on her radar screen.</div><div><br /></div><div>Born in Denmark, Vestager&nbsp;held various ministerial posts in her country&#39;s government before being appointed to the European Commission in 2014.
