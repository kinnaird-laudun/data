											There&#39;s a man by the name of Captain

											On that day, a column of American
											and Afghan troops
											were making their way
											through a part of Afghanistan
											to help protect
											a group of government officials,
											a group of Afghan government officials,
											who would be meeting with some local
											village elders.
											The column came under ambush,
											and was surrounded on three sides,
											and amongst many other things,
											Captain Swenson was recognized
											for running into live fire
											to rescue the wounded
											and pull out the dead.
											One of the people he rescued was a sergeant,
											and he and a comrade were making their way
											to a medevac helicopter.

											And what was remarkable about this day
											is, by sheer coincidence,
											one of the medevac medics
											happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet
											and captured the whole scene on camera.
											It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade
											bringing this wounded soldier
											who had received a gunshot to the neck.
											They put him in the helicopter,
											and then you see Captain Swenson bend over
											and give him a kiss
											before he turns around to rescue more.

											I saw this, and I thought to myself,
											where do people like that come from?
											What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,
											when you would want to do that.
											There&#39;s a love there,
											and I wanted to know why is it that
											I don&#39;t have people that I work with like that?
											You know, in the military, they give medals
											to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves
											so that others may gain.
											In business, we give bonuses to people
											who are willing to sacrifice others
											so that we may gain.
											We have it backwards. Right?
											So I asked myself, where do
people like this come from?
											And my initial conclusion was
that they&#39;re just better people.
											That&#39;s why they&#39;re attracted to the military.
											These better people are attracted
											to this concept of service.
											But that&#39;s completely wrong.
											What I learned was that it&#39;s the environment,
											and if you get the environment right,
											every single one of us has the capacity
											to do these remarkable things,
											and more importantly, others have that capacity too.
											I&#39;ve had the great honor of getting to meet
											some of these, who we would call heroes,
											who have put themselves and put their lives
											at risk to save others,
											and I asked them, &quot;Why would you do it?
											Why did you do it?&quot;
											And they all say the same thing:
											&quot;Because they would have done it for me.&quot;
											It&#39;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation.
											So trust and cooperation are really important here.
											The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation
											is that they are feelings, they are not instructions.
											I can&#39;t simply say to you, &quot;Trust me,&quot; and you will.
											I can&#39;t simply instruct two people 
to cooperate, and they will.

											So where does that feeling come from?
											If you go back 50,000 years
											to the Paleolithic era,
											to the early days of Homo sapiens,
											what we find is that the world
											was filled with danger,
											all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.
											Nothing personal.
											Whether it was the weather,
											lack of resources,
											maybe a saber-toothed tiger,
											all of these things working
											to reduce our lifespan.
											And so we evolved into social animals,
											where we lived together and worked together
											in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,
											where we felt like we belonged.
											And when we felt safe amongst our own,
											the natural reaction was trust and cooperation.
											There are inherent benefits to this.
											It means I can fall asleep at night
											and trust that someone from within
my tribe will watch for danger.
											If we don&#39;t trust each other, if I don&#39;t trust you,
											that means you won&#39;t watch for danger.
											Bad system of survival.

											The modern day is exactly the same thing.
											The world is filled with danger,
											things that are trying to frustrate our lives
											or reduce our success,
											reduce our opportunity for success.
											It could be the ups and downs in the economy,
											the uncertainty of the stock market.
											It could be a new technology that renders
											your business model obsolete overnight.
											Or it could be your competition
											that is sometimes trying to kill you.
											It&#39;s sometimes trying to put you out of business,
											but at the very minimum
											is working hard to frustrate your growth
											and steal your business from you.
											We have no control over these forces.
											These are a constant,

											The only variable are the conditions
											inside the organization,
											and that&#39;s where leadership matters,
											because it&#39;s the leader that sets the tone.
											When a leader makes the choice
											to put the safety and lives
											of the people inside the organization first,
											to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice
											the tangible results, so that the people remain
											and feel safe and feel like they belong,

											I was flying on a trip,

											The closest analogy I can give

											If you think about what being a great parent is,

											education, discipline them when necessary,
											all so that they can grow up and achieve more

											Great leaders want exactly the same thing.

											This is the reason so many people
											have such a visceral hatred, anger,
											at some of these banking CEOs
											with their disproportionate
salaries and bonus structures.
											It&#39;s not the numbers.
											It&#39;s that they have violated the
very definition of leadership.
											They have violated this deep-seated social contract.
											We know that they allowed their people
											to be sacrificed so they could
protect their own interests,
											or worse, they sacrificed their people
											to protect their own interests.
											This is what so offends us, not the numbers.
											Would anybody be offended if we gave

											How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?
											Do we have an issue with that? None at all.

											Bob Chapman, who runs
											a large manufacturing company in the Midwest
											called Barry-Wehmiller,
											in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession,
											and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight.
											Now in a large manufacturing company,
											this is a big deal,
											and they could no longer afford their labor pool.
											They needed to save 10 million dollars,
											so, like so many companies today,
											the board got together and discussed layoffs.
											And Bob refused.
											You see, Bob doesn&#39;t believe in head counts.
											Bob believes in heart counts,
											and it&#39;s much more difficult to simply reduce
											the heart count.
											And so they came up with a furlough program.
											Every employee, from secretary to CEO,
											was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation.
											They could take it any time they wanted,
											and they did not have to take it consecutively.
											But it was how Bob announced the program
											that mattered so much.
											He said, it&#39;s better that we should all suffer a little
											than any of us should have to suffer a lot,
											and morale went up.
											They saved 20 million dollars,
											and most importantly, as would be expected,
											when the people feel safe and protected
by the leadership in the organization,
											the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.
											And quite spontaneously, nobody expected,
											people started trading with each other.
											Those who could afford it more
											would trade with those who could afford it less.
											People would take five weeks
											so that somebody else only had to take three.

											Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank.

											They are authorities, and we do what they say

											And I know many people

											I heard a story
											of some Marines
											who were out in theater,
											and as is the Marine custom,
											the officer ate last,
											and he let his men eat first,
											and when they were done,
											there was no food left for him.
											And when they went back out in the field,
											his men brought him some of their food
											so that he may eat,
											because that&#39;s what happens.
											We call them leaders because they go first.
											We call them leaders because they take the risk
											before anybody else does.
											We call them leaders because they will choose
											to sacrifice so that their people
											may be safe and protected
											and so their people may gain,
											and when we do, the natural response
											is that our people will sacrifice for us.
											They will give us their blood and sweat and tears
											to see that their leader&#39;s vision comes to life,
											and when we ask them, &quot;Why would you do that?
											Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears
											for that person?&quot; they all say the same thing:
											&quot;Because they would have done it for me.&quot;
