											I am known best for human-powered flight,
											but that was just one thing that got me going
											in the sort of things that I&#39;m working in now.
											As a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,
											ornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes,
											indoor models, outdoor models, everything,
											which I just thought was a lot of fun,
											and wondered why most other people didn&#39;t share my same enthusiasm with them.
											And then, navy pilot training, and, after college,
											I got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,
											and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,
											but got tangled up with some great professor types,
											who convinced me and everybody else in the field
											that this was a good way to get into really deep science.

											While this was all going on, I was in the field of weather modification,
											although getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics.
											The weather modification subject was getting started,
											and as a graduate student,
											I could go around to the various talks that were being given,
											on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,
											and so on. And everybody would talk to me,
											but all the professionals in the field hated each other,
											and they wouldn&#39;t communicate. And as a result,
											I got the absolutely unique background in that field,
											and started a company, which did more research
											in weather modification than anybody,
											and there are a lot of things that I just can&#39;t go into.
											But then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees —
											then one or two, three,
											and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects.
											We had AirDynamisis,
											who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies
											on some big, many year project,
											and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew.

											The thing that is exciting was, in 1976,
											I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane
											because I&#39;d made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars,
											or I guaranteed the money at the bank.
											He needed them — he needed the money for starting a company.
											The company did not succeed, and he couldn&#39;t pay the money back,
											and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,
											and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,
											which had then been around for — (Laughter) —
											17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds,
											which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars.

									<p>
											So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight —
											(Laughter) —
											and did not — the way I approached it, first,
											thinking about ways to make the planes,
											was just like they&#39;d been doing in England, and not succeeding,
											and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn&#39;t any simple, easy way.
											But then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,
											just for the fun of it,
											and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,
											and measure the time, and estimate the bank angle,
											and immediately, figure out its speed,
											and the turning radius, and so on,
											which I could do in the car, as we&#39;re driving along on a vacation trip —
											(Laughter) —
											with my three sons, young sons, helping me,
											but ridiculing the whole thing very much.

									<p>
											But that began thinking about how birds went around,
											and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,
											and then other planes,
											and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,
											was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place,
											but one didn&#39;t. And it was just, keep the weight down —
											70 pounds was all it weighed — but let the size swell up, like a hang glider,
											but three times the span, three times the cord.
											You&#39;re down to a third of the speed, a third of the power,
											and a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked,
											and we won the prize a year later.

											We didn&#39;t — a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn&#39;t work,
											and ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.
											Got a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it,
											and finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,
											about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project.

											And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.
											But fortunately, Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for —
											that was a one-mile flight — put up a new prize
											for flying the English Channel, 21 miles.
											And he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.
											We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,
											the power to fly would be decreased a little bit,
											and if you decrease the power required a little,
											the pilot can fly a much longer period of time.
											And Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,
											to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel,
											and we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.
											And when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.
											It turned out that giving the planes to the museum
											was worth much more than the debt,
											so for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.
											So, there were good economic reasons for the project, but —

											that&#39;s not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons,
											and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then —
											(Laughter) —
											because the prizes are all over.
											(Laughter)
											But that sure started me thinking about various things,
											and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane
											because we felt solar power was going to be so important
											for the country and the world,
											we didn&#39;t want the small funding in the government to be decreased,
											which is what the government was trying to do with it.
											And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn&#39;t really make sense,
											but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power
											and maybe help that field.
											And that project continued, did succeed,
											and we then got into other projects in aviation
											and mechanical things and ground devices.

											But while this was going on,
											in 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation —
											their annual prize —
											and I had to prepare a paper on it,
											which collected all my varied thoughts
											and varied interests over the years.
											This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,
											and what was important. And to my surprise,
											I realized the importance of environmental issues,
											which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to,
											and preparing that paper did me a lot of good.
											I thought back about if I was a space traveler,
											and came and visited Earth every 5,000 years.
											And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,
											the little differences in the Earth.

											I wanted to — well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,

											(Applause) —
											it shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.

											Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on, are —

											As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so
											as you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.
											And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
											The launch is the difficult part: you&#39;ve got to hold it high up, over your head,
