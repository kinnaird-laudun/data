											It&#39;s not about technology,
											it&#39;s about people and stories.
											I could show you
											what recently was on television
											as a high quality video:
											60 Minutes, many of you may have seen it.
											And it was the now director of the entire piece
											of the veteran&#39;s administration —
											who, himself, had lost an arm 39 years ago
											in Vietnam —
											who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices
											that don&#39;t work.
											And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background,
											after he pretty much made his position clear on this —
											he had his hook and he had his —
											he wore this arm for less than two hours
											and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact
											that, quote — his quote —
											it&#39;s the first time he&#39;s felt like he&#39;s had an arm in 39 years.

									<p>
											But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story,
											and I&#39;m not going to show you that polished video.
											I&#39;m going to, instead, in a minute or two,
											show you an early, crude video
											because I think it&#39;s
											a better way to tell a story.

											A few years ago I was visited by
											the guy that runs DARPA,
											the people that fund all the advanced technologies
											that businesses and universities probably wouldn&#39;t take the risk of doing.
											They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.
											I get this sort of unrequested — by me anyway — visit,
											and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon
											from the military
											and the guy that runs DARPA.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											They proceed to tell me a story which comes down
											to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies
											now and made them available
											in the most remote places that we put soldiers:
											hills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...
											They were quite proud of the fact that
											you know, before the dust clears,
											if some soldier has been hurt
											they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,
											they will be getting world-class triage emergency care
											faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt
											in a car accident in a major city in the United States.
											That&#39;s the good news.

									<p>
											The bad news is if they&#39;ve collected this person
											and he or she is missing an arm or leg,
											part of the face, it&#39;s probably not coming back.
											So, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.
											And then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger,
											he said, &quot;Why is it? At the end of the Civil War,
											they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm,
											we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it.
											Now we&#39;ve got F18s and F22s,
											and if somebody loses an arm,
											we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it.&quot;

									<p>
											And they basically said, &quot;This is unacceptable,&quot;
											and then the punchline: &quot;So, Dean,
											we&#39;re here because you make medical stuff.
											You&#39;re going to give us an arm.&quot;
											And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,
											paperwork and DODs.
											No, the guy says,
											&quot;We&#39;re going to bring a guy into this conference room,
											and wearing the arm you&#39;re going to give us,
											he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape
											off this table.
											If it&#39;s the grape, they won&#39;t break it.&quot;
											Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.
											&quot;If it&#39;s the raisin, they won&#39;t drop it.&quot;
											So he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist,
											flex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.
											Either way they were going to eat it.

									<p>
											&quot;Oh, by the way Dean. It&#39;s going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame —
											namely 32 inches from the long finger —
											and weigh less than nine pounds.&quot;
											50th percentile female frame.
											&quot;And it&#39;s going to be completely self contained including all its power.&quot;
											So, they finished that. And I, as you can tell,
											am a bashful guy.
											I told them they&#39;re nuts.
											(Laughter)
											They&#39;ve been watching too much &quot;Terminator.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											Then, the surgeon says to me,
											&quot;Dean, you need to know
											more than two dozen of these kids have come back
											bilateral.&quot;
											Now, I cannot imagine —
											I&#39;m sorry, you may have a better
											imagination than I do —
											I can&#39;t imagine losing my arm,
											and typically at 22 years old.
											But compared to that, losing two?
											Seems like that would be an inconvenience.

											Anyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.
											I literally could not sleep
											thinking about, &quot;I wonder how you&#39;d roll over
											with no shoulders.&quot;
											So, I decided we&#39;ve got to do this.
											And trust me, I&#39;ve got a day job, I&#39;ve got a lot of day jobs.
											Most of my day job keeps me busy
											funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....
											And I&#39;ve got a lot of day jobs.
											But I figured I gotta do this.
											Did a little investigation,
											went down to Washington, told them
											I still think they&#39;re nuts but we&#39;re going to do it.
											And I told them I&#39;d build them an arm.
											I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,
											and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.
											Look what it takes to make things like iPods.
											&quot;Great,&quot; he said, &quot;You got two years.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											I said, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what. I&#39;ll build you an arm
											that&#39;s under nine pounds
											that has all that capability in one year.
											It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful.&quot;
											We sort of agreed to disagree.

											I went back and I started putting a team together,
											the best guys I could find with a passion to do this.
											At the end of exactly one year
											we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom,
											all the sensors, all the microprocessors,
											all the stuff inside.
											I could show you it with a cosmesis on it
											that&#39;s so real it&#39;s eerie, but then you wouldn&#39;t see
											all this cool stuff.
											I then thought it would be years
											before we&#39;d be able to make it really, really useful.
											It turned out, as I think you could see
											in Aimee&#39;s capabilities and attitudes,
											people with a desire to do something
											are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable.

									<p>
											Anyway, with less than 10 hours of use,
											two guys — one that&#39;s bilateral.
											He&#39;s literally, he&#39;s got no shoulder on one side,
											and he&#39;s high trans-humeral on the other.
											And that&#39;s Chuck and Randy together,
											after 10 hours — were playing in our office.
											And we took some pretty cruddy home movies.
											At the end of the one I&#39;m going to show, it&#39;s only about a minute
											and a couple of seconds long,
											Chuck does something that to this day I&#39;m jealous of,
											I can&#39;t do it.
											He picks up a spoon, picks it up,
											scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk,
											holds the spoon level
											as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,
											to his mouth, and he doesn&#39;t drop any milk.
											(Laughter)
											I cannot do that.
											(Laughter)
											His wife was standing behind me.
											She&#39;s standing behind me at the time
											and she says, &quot;Dean,
											Chuck hasn&#39;t fed himself in 19 years.
											So, you&#39;ve got a choice:
											We keep the arm, or you keep Chuck.&quot;

									<p>
											So, can we see that?
											This is Chuck showing simultaneous control
											of all the joints.
											He&#39;s punching our controls guy. The guy behind him
											is our engineer/surgeon,
											which is a convenient guy to have around.
											There&#39;s Randy, these guys are passing a rubber
											little puck between them.
											And just as in the spirit of FIRST,
											gracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this,
											so they decide to share a drink.
											This is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way.
											Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it,
											doing either of those.
											Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary,
											at least for my limited physical skill.
											And now he&#39;s going to do what DARPA asked me for.
											He&#39;s going to pick up a grape — he didn&#39;t drop it,
											he didn&#39;t break it —
											and he&#39;s going to eat it.
											So, that&#39;s where we were
											at the end of about 15 months.

											But, as I&#39;ve learned from Richard,
											the technology, the processors, the sensors, the motors,
											is not the story.
											I hadn&#39;t dealt with this kind of problem
											or frankly, this whole segment
											of the medical world.
											I&#39;ll give you some astounding things that have happened
											as we started this.
											After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design,
											and we&#39;d have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make —
											you can always get three out of four of anything you want;
											the weight, the size, the cost, the functionality —
											I put a bunch of guys in my plane
											and I said, &quot;We&#39;re flying down to Walter Reed, and we&#39;re going talk to these kids,
											because frankly it doesn&#39;t matter whether we like this arm.
											It doesn&#39;t matter whether the
											Department of Defense likes this arm.&quot;
											When I told them that they weren&#39;t entirely enthusiastic,
											but I told them, &quot;It really doesn&#39;t matter what their opinion is.
											There is only one opinion that matters,

											I told a bunch of my engineers, &quot;Look we&#39;re going to walk into Walter Reed,

											They&#39;re probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated.
											We&#39;re probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.
											But we&#39;ve got to extract from them
											enough information to make sure we&#39;re doing the right thing.&quot;
											We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong.
											We did see a bunch of people,
											a lot of them missing a lot of body parts,
											and parts they had left were burned;
											half a face gone, an ear burned off.

											They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us.
											And we started asking them all questions.
											&quot;Look,&quot; I&#39;d say to them, &quot;We&#39;re not quite as good as nature yet.
											I could give you fine motor control,
											or I could let you curl 40 pounds;
											I probably can&#39;t do both.
											I can give you fast control
											with low reduction ratios in these gears,
											or I can give you power;
											I can&#39;t give you both.
											And we were trying to get them to all help us

											Not only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinking
											they&#39;re there to help us.
											&quot;Well, would it help if I ...&quot;
											&quot;Guys, and woman,
											you&#39;ve given enough.

											After a half an hour, maybe, there was one guy at the far end of the table
											who wasn&#39;t saying much.
											You could see he was missing an arm.
											He was leaning on his other arm.
											I called down to the end, &quot;Hey, you haven&#39;t said much.
											If we needed this or this, what would you want?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;You know,
											I&#39;m the lucky guy at this table.
											I lost my right arm,
											but I&#39;m a lefty.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											So, he wouldn&#39;t say much.
											He had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits.

											They&#39;re not finished giving yet.&quot;
											It was astounding.
											So, we went back.
											And I started working harder, faster.
											Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center.
											And we saw lots of these kids, lots of them.
											And it was astounding

											So, we went back,
											and we&#39;ve been working harder yet.

											He&#39;s got no legs.
											He&#39;s got no arms.

											And he said,
											&quot;I need your arms,

											&quot;You&#39;ll get them.&quot;
											This kid was from Staten Island.
											And he said, &quot;I had a truck,

											You think I&#39;ll be able to drive it?&quot;
											&quot;Sure.&quot;
											And I turned around and went, &quot;How are we going to do this?&quot;
											(Laughter)
											Anyway, he was just like all the rest of them.

											I&#39;ll shut up, except one message

											&quot;Who is entitled to what?
											Who is entitled to how much?

											I know what these kids deserve

											stick with a hook on it —
											but there&#39;s nobody in this room that would rather have that
											than the one you got.
											But I was saying to him, &quot;You know,
											the first airplane

											Wilbur and Orville.
											But you know what? It wouldn&#39;t have made an old pigeon jealous.
											But now we got Eagles out there,

											I&#39;ve never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2.
