											And certainly there are things
about the climate crisis that qualify.
											And I have some bad news,
											but I have a lot more good news.
											I&#39;m going to propose three questions
											and the answer to the first one
											necessarily involves a little bad news.
											But — hang on, because the answers
to the second and third questions

											So the first question is,
&quot;Do we really have to change?&quot;
											And of course, the Apollo Mission,
among other things
											changed the environmental movement,
											really launched the modern
environmental movement.
											18 months after this Earthrise picture
was first seen on earth,
											the first Earth Day was organized.
											And we learned a lot about ourselves
											looking back at our planet from space.
											And one of the things that we learned
											confirmed what the scientists
have long told us.
											One of the most essential facts
											about the climate crisis
has to do with the sky.
											As this picture illustrates,
											the sky is not the vast
and limitless expanse
											that appears when we look up
from the ground.
											It is a very thin shell of atmosphere
											surrounding the planet.
											That right now is the open sewer
for our industrial civilization
											as it&#39;s currently organized.
											We are spewing 110 million tons
											of heat-trapping global warming pollution
into it every 24 hours,
											free of charge, go ahead.

											And there are many sources
of the greenhouse gases,
											I&#39;m certainly not going
to go through them all.
											I&#39;m going to focus on the main one,
											but agriculture is involved,
diet is involved, population is involved.
											Management of forests, transportation,
											the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.
											But I&#39;m going to focus
on the heart of the problem,
											which is the fact that we still rely
on dirty, carbon-based fuels
											for 85 percent of all the energy
that our world burns every year.
											And you can see from this image
that after World War II,
											the emission rates
started really accelerating.
											And the accumulated amount
of man-made, global warming pollution
											that is up in the atmosphere now
											traps as much extra heat energy
as would be released
											by 400,000 Hiroshima-class
atomic bombs exploding
											every 24 hours, 365 days a year.
											Fact-checked over and over again,

											Let&#39;s look at the atmosphere.
											This is a depiction
											of what we used to think of as
the normal distribution of temperatures.
											The white represents
normal temperature days;
											1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.
											The blue are cooler than average days,
											the red are warmer than average days.
											But the entire curve has moved
to the right in the 1980s.

											The first order of consequence:
											the ocean-based storms get stronger.
											Super Typhoon Haiyan
went over areas of the Pacific
											five and a half degrees Fahrenheit
warmer than normal
											before it slammed into Tacloban,
											as the most destructive storm
ever to make landfall.

											The warmer oceans are evaporating

											Average humidity worldwide
has gone up four percent.

crisis is mounting up,

											It&#39;s an enormous burden.
											I&#39;ll mention just one more,

last month in Davos,

of 750 economists,
											said the climate crisis is now
the number one risk
											to the global economy.
											So you get central bankers

of the carbon reserves are unburnable.
											Subprime carbon.
											I&#39;m not going to remind you what happened

											If you look at all of the carbon fuels
that were burned
											since the beginning
of the industrial revolution,
											this is the quantity burned
in the last 16 years.
											Here are all the ones that are proven
and left on the books,
											28 trillion dollars.

says only this amount can be burned.

											Now, the business community
has certainly noticed this,

											Cheaper solar penetration rates
are beginning to rise.
											Grid parity is understood

											below which renewable electricity
is cheaper than electricity
											from burning fossil fuels.
											That threshold is a little bit
like the difference
											between 32 degrees Fahrenheit
and 33 degrees Fahrenheit,
											or zero and one Celsius.
											It&#39;s a difference of more than one degree,
											it&#39;s the difference between ice and water.
											And it&#39;s the difference between markets
that are frozen up,
											and liquid flows of capital
into new opportunities for investment.
											This is the biggest
new business opportunity
											in the history of the world,
											and two-thirds of it
is in the private sector.
											We are seeing an explosion
of new investment.
											Starting in 2010, investments globally
in renewable electricity generation
											surpassed fossils.
											The gap has been growing ever since.
											The projections for the future
are even more dramatic,
											even though fossil energy
is now still subsidized
											at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.
											And by the way, if you add
the projections for nuclear on here,
											particularly if you assume

for such a rapid adoption

											commissioned McKinsey to do
a global market survey

											&quot;How many can we sell

when the year 2000 arrived,
											they did sell 900,000 —
in the first three days.
											And for the balance of the year,
they sold 120 times more.

											And I think the answer is in three parts.
											First, the cost came down much faster
than anybody expected,
											even as the quality went up.
											And low-income countries, places
that did not have a landline grid —
											they leap-frogged to the new technology.
											The big expansion has been
in the developing counties.
											So what about the electricity grids
in the developing world?
											Well, not so hot.
											And in many areas, they don&#39;t exist.
											There are more people
without any electricity at all in India
											than the entire population

											So now we&#39;re getting this:
											solar panels on grass huts

											enough energy from the Sun
comes to the earth
											every hour to supply the full world&#39;s
energy needs for an entire year.
											It&#39;s actually a little bit
less than an hour.
											So the answer to the second question,

											that is in the tradition of others
that we have faced.
											One of the greatest poets
of the last century in the US,
											Wallace Stevens,
											wrote a line that has stayed with me:
											&quot;After the final &#39;no,&#39;
there comes a &#39;yes,&#39;
											and on that &#39;yes&#39;,
the future world depends.&quot;
											When the abolitionists
started their movement,
											they met with no after no after no.
											And then came a yes.
											The Women&#39;s Suffrage
and Women&#39;s Rights Movement
											met endless no&#39;s, until finally,
there was a yes.
											The Civil Rights Movement,
the movement against apartheid,
											and more recently, the movement
for gay and lesbian rights
											here in the United States and elsewhere.
											After the final &quot;no&quot; comes a &quot;yes.&quot;

											When any great moral challenge
is ultimately resolved
											into a binary choice
between what is right and what is wrong,
											the outcome is fore-ordained
because of who we are as human beings.
											Ninety-nine percent of us,
that is where we are now
											and it is why we&#39;re going to win this.
											We have everything we need.
											Some still doubt that we have
the will to act,
											but I say the will to act is itself
a renewable resource.

											AG: I think that the crossing —

in the business world for 15 years.
											But one of the things I&#39;ve learned
is that apparently it matters

											And when it crosses that line,

											The late Rudi Dornbusch,
the great economist said,
											&quot;Things take longer to happen
then you think they will,

than you thought they could.&quot;
											I really think that&#39;s where we are.

											And they defeated the proposal.
											So, finally, the answer
to your question is,
											this sounds a little corny
and maybe it&#39;s a cliché,

referred to this —
											there are people in this audience
who played an incredibly significant role
