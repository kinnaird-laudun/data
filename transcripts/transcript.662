											We&#39;re here today to announce
											the first synthetic cell,
											a cell made by
											starting with the digital code in the computer,
											building the chromosome
											from four bottles of chemicals,
											assembling that chromosome in yeast,
											transplanting it into
											a recipient bacterial cell
											and transforming that cell
											into a new bacterial species.
											So this is the first self-replicating species
											that we&#39;ve had on the planet
											whose parent is a computer.
											It also is the first species
											to have its own website
											encoded in its genetic code.
											But we&#39;ll talk more about
											the watermarks in a minute.

											This is a project that had its inception
											15 years ago
											when our team then —
											we called the institute TIGR —
											was involved in sequencing
											the first two genomes in history.
											We did Haemophilus influenzae
											and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,
											that of Mycoplasma genitalium.
											And as soon as
											we had these two sequences
											we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome
											of a self-replicating species,
											could there be even a smaller genome?
											Could we understand the basis of cellular life
											at the genetic level?
											It&#39;s been a 15-year quest
											just to get to the starting point now
											to be able to answer those questions,
											because it&#39;s very difficult to eliminate
											multiple genes from a cell.
											You can only do them one at a time.
											We decided early on
											that we had to take a synthetic route,
											even though nobody had been there before,
											to see if we could synthesize
											a bacterial chromosome
											so we could actually vary the gene content
											to understand the essential genes for life.
											That started our 15-year quest
											to get here.

											But before we did the first experiments,
											we actually asked
											Art Caplan&#39;s team at the University of Pennsylvania
											to undertake a review
											of what the risks, the challenges,
											the ethics around creating new
											species in the laboratory were
											because it hadn&#39;t been done before.
											They spent about two years
											reviewing that independently
											and published their results in Science in 1999.
											Ham and I took two years off
											as a side project to sequence the human genome,
											but as soon as that was done
											we got back to the task at hand.

											In 2002, we started
											a new institute,
											the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,
											where we set out two goals:
											One, to understand
											the impact of our technology on the environment,
											and how to understand the environment better,
											and two, to start down this process
											of making synthetic life
											to understand basic life.
											In 2003,
											we published our first success.
											So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison
											developed some new methods
											for making error-free DNA
											at a small level.
											Our first task was
											a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,
											a virus that attacks only E. coli.
											So that was
											the phage phi X 174,
											which was chosen for historical reasons.
											It was the first DNA phage,
											DNA virus, DNA genome
											that was actually sequenced.
											So once we realized
											that we could make 5,000-base pair
											viral-sized pieces,
											we thought, we at least have the means
											then to try and make serially lots of these pieces
											to be able to eventually assemble them together
											to make this mega base chromosome.
											So, substantially larger than
											we even thought we would go initially.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											There were several steps to this. There were two sides:
											We had to solve the chemistry
											for making large DNA molecules,
											and we had to solve the biological side
											of how, if we had this new chemical entity,
											how would we boot it up, activate it
											in a recipient cell.
											We had two teams working in parallel:
											one team on the chemistry,
											and the other on trying to
											be able to transplant
											entire chromosomes
											to get new cells.
											When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,
											which is why we chose the smallest genome.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome
											to a much larger one.
											And we can walk through the reasons for that,
											but basically the small cell
											took on the order of
											one to two months to get results from,
											whereas the larger, faster-growing cell
											takes only two days.
											So there&#39;s only so many cycles we could go through
											in a year at six weeks per cycle.
											And you should know that basically
											99, probably 99 percent plus
											of our experiments failed.
											So this was a debugging,
											problem-solving scenario from the beginning
											because there was no recipe
											of how to get there.

									<p>
											So, one of the most important publications we had
											was in 2007.
											Carole Lartigue led the effort
											to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome
											from one bacteria to another.
											I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers
											that we&#39;ve ever done
											because it showed how dynamic life was.
											And we knew, once that worked,
											that we actually had a chance
											if we could make the synthetic chromosomes
											to do the same with those.
											We didn&#39;t know that it was going to take us
											several years more to get there.

											In 2008,
											we reported the complete synthesis
											of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,
											a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,
											but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.
											We think in part, because of its slow growth
											and, in part,
											cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms
											to keep these events from happening.
											It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into
											had a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,
											and was happy to eat
											the synthetic DNA that we gave it
											and never got transplantations.
											But at the time, that was the largest
											molecule of a defined structure
											that had been made.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so both sides were progressing,
											but part of the synthesis
											had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished
											using yeast, putting the fragments in yeast
											and yeast would assemble these for us.
											It&#39;s an amazing step forward,
											but we had a problem because now we had
											the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.
											So in addition to doing the transplant,
											we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome
											out of the eukaryotic yeast
											into a form where we could transplant it
											into a recipient cell.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So our team developed new techniques
											for actually growing, cloning
											entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.
											So we took the same mycoides genome
											that Carole had initially transplanted,
											and we grew that in yeast
											as an artificial chromosome.
											And we thought this would be a great test bed
											for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast
											and transplant them.
											When we did these experiments, though,
											we could get the chromosome out of yeast
											but it wouldn&#39;t transplant and boot up a cell.
											That little issue took the team two years to solve.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell
											was actually methylated,
											and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,
											from digesting the DNA.
											So what we found is if we took the chromosome
											out of yeast and methylated it,
											we could then transplant it.
											Further advances came
											when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes
											from the recipient capricolum cell.
											And once we had done that, now we can take
											naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So last fall
											when we published the results of that work in Science,
											we all became overconfident
											and were sure we were only
											a few weeks away
											from being able to now boot up
											a chromosome out of yeast.
											Because of the problems with
											Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth
											about a year and a half ago,
											we decided to synthesize
											the much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,
											knowing that we had the biology worked out on that
											for transplantation.
											And Dan led the team for the synthesis
											of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.
											But it turned out it wasn&#39;t going to be as simple in the end,
											and it set us back three months
											because we had one error
											out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the team developed new debugging software,
											where we could test each synthetic fragment
											to see if it would grow in a background
											of wild type DNA.
											And we found that 10 out of the 11
											100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized
											were completely accurate
											and compatible with
											a life-forming sequence.
											We narrowed it down to one fragment;
											we sequenced it
											and found just one base pair had been deleted
											in an essential gene.
											So accuracy is essential.
											There&#39;s parts of the genome
											where it cannot tolerate even a single error,
											and then there&#39;s parts of the genome
											where we can put in large blocks of DNA,
											as we did with the watermarks,
											and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.
											So it took about three months to find that error
											and repair it.
											And then early one morning, at 6 a.m.
											we got a text from Dan
											saying that, now, the first blue colonies existed.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, it&#39;s been a long route to get here:
											15 years from the beginning.
											We felt
											one of the tenets of this field
											was to make absolutely certain
											we could distinguish synthetic DNA
											from natural DNA.
											Early on, when you&#39;re working in a new area of science,
											you have to think about all the pitfalls
											and things that could lead you
											to believe that you had done something when you hadn&#39;t,
											and, even worse, leading others to believe it.
											So, we thought the worst problem would be
											a single molecule contamination
											of the native chromosome,
											leading us to believe that we actually had
											created a synthetic cell,
											when it would have been just a contaminant.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So early on, we developed the notion
											of putting in watermarks in the DNA
											to absolutely make clear
											that the DNA was synthetic.
											And the first chromosome we built
											in 2008 —
											the 500,000-base pair one —
											we simply assigned
											the names of the authors of the chromosome
											into the genetic code,
											but it was using just amino acid
											single letter translations,
											which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.
											So the team actually developed a new code
											within the code within the code.
											So it&#39;s a new code
											for interpreting and writing messages in DNA.
											Now, mathematicians have been hiding and writing
											messages in the genetic code for a long time,
											but it&#39;s clear they were mathematicians and not biologists
											because, if you write long messages
											with the code that the mathematicians developed,
											it would more than likely lead to
											new proteins being synthesized
											with unknown functions.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed
											actually puts frequent stop codons,
											so it&#39;s a different alphabet
											but allows us to use
											the entire English alphabet
											with punctuation and numbers.
											So, there are four major watermarks
											all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.
											The first one actually contains within it
											this code for interpreting
											the rest of the genetic code.
											So in the remaining information,
											in the watermarks,
											contain the names of, I think it&#39;s
											46 different authors
											and key contributors
											to getting the project to this stage.
											And we also built in
											a website address
											so that if somebody decodes the code
											within the code within the code,
											they can send an email to that address.
											So it&#39;s clearly distinguishable
											from any other species,
											having 46 names in it,
											its own web address.
											And we added three quotations,
											because with the first genome
											we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound
											than just signing the work.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we won&#39;t give the rest of the code,
											but we will give the three quotations.
											The first is,
											&quot;To live, to err,
											to fall, to triumph
											and to recreate life out of life.&quot;
											It&#39;s a James Joyce quote.
											The second quotation is, &quot;See things not as they are,
											but as they might be.&quot;
											It&#39;s a quote from the &quot;American Prometheus&quot;
											book on Robert Oppenheimer.
											And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:
											&quot;What I cannot build,
											I cannot understand.&quot;
											So, because this is as much a philosophical advance
											as a technical advance in science,
											we tried to deal with both the philosophical
											and the technical side.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions
											is that the extensive work
											that we&#39;ve done —
											asking for ethical review,
											pushing the envelope
											on that side as well as the technical side —
											this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,
											in the policy community
											and at the highest levels of the federal government.
											Even with this announcement,
											as we did in 2003 —
											that work was funded by the Department of Energy,
											so the work was reviewed
											at the level of the White House,
											trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.
											And they came down on the side of open publication,
											which is the right approach —
											we&#39;ve briefed the White House,
											we&#39;ve briefed members of Congress,
											we&#39;ve tried to take and push
											the policy issues
											in parallel with the scientific advances.

											Craig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is?
											I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.
											It&#39;s significant to us.
											Perhaps it&#39;s a giant philosophical change
											in how we view life.
											We actually view it as a baby step in terms of,
											it&#39;s taken us 15 years to be able
											to do the experiment
											we wanted to do 15 years ago
											on understanding life at its basic level.
											But we actually believe

											We have, at the Institute,
											ongoing funding now from NIH
											in a program with Novartis
											to try and use these new
											synthetic DNA tools
											to perhaps make the flu vaccine
											that you might get next year.
											Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these,
											Dan&#39;s team can now make these
											in less than 24 hours.
											So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,
											we think we can shorten that process
											quite substantially.
											In the vaccine area,
											Synthetic Genomics and the Institute
											are forming a new vaccine company
											because we think these tools can affect vaccines
											to diseases that haven&#39;t been possible to date,
											things where the viruses rapidly evolve,
											such with rhinovirus.
											Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?
											Or, more importantly, HIV,
											where the virus evolves so quickly
											the vaccines that are made today

											Also, at Synthetic Genomics,
											we&#39;ve been working

											I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf
											is a reminder.
											We can&#39;t see CO2 —
											we depend on scientific measurements for it
											and we see the beginning results
											of having too much of it —
											but we can see pre-CO2 now
											floating on the waters
											and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.
											We need some alternatives
											for oil.
											We have a program with Exxon Mobile
											to try and develop new strains of algae
											that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide
											from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,
											make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries

Quite a task, when you consider that there are tens of millions of microbes in a single drop of sea water. Then there&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.jcvi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">J. Craig Venter Institute</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to researching genomics and exploring its societal implications. </p><p>In 2005, Venter founded <a href=\"http://www.syntheticgenomics.com/about.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Synthetic Genomics</a>, a private company with <strong>a provocative mission: to engineer new life forms</strong>. Its goal is to design, synthesize and assemble <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_laboratorium\" target=\"_blank\">synthetic microorganisms</a>  that will produce alternative fuels, such as ethanol or hydrogen.

Craig Venter Institute announced that they had manufactured the entire genome of a bacterium by painstakingly stitching together its chemical components. By sequencing a genome, scientists can begin to custom-design bootable organisms, creating biological robots that can produce from scratch chemicals humans can use, such as biofuel.
