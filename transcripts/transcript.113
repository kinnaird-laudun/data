											I get asked a lot what the difference
between my work is
											and typical Pentagon
long-range strategic planners.
											And the answer I like to offer is
											what they typically do is they think
about the future of wars
											in the context of war.
											And what I&#39;ve spent 15 years
doing in this business —
											and it&#39;s taken me almost
14 to figure it out —
											is I think about the future of wars
in the context of everything else.
											So I tend to specialize
on the scene between war and peace.
											The material I&#39;m going to show
you is one idea from a book
											with a lot of ideas.
											It&#39;s the one that takes me
around the world right now
											interacting with foreign
militaries quite a bit.
											The material was generated
in two years of work I did
											for the Secretary of Defense,
											thinking about a new
national grand strategy
											for the United States.
											I&#39;m going to present a problem
											and try to give you an answer.

											Here&#39;s my favorite bonehead concept
from the 1990s in the Pentagon:
											the theory of anti-access,
area-denial asymmetrical strategies.
											Why do we call it that?
											Because it&#39;s got all those
A&#39;s lined up I guess.
											This is gobbledygook for
											if the United States fights
somebody we&#39;re going to be huge.
											They&#39;re going to be small.
											And if they try to fight us
in the traditional, straight-up manner
											we&#39;re going to kick their ass,
											which is why people don&#39;t
try to do that any more.
											I met the last Air Force
General who had actually
											shot down an enemy plane in combat.
											He&#39;s now a one star General.
											That&#39;s how distant
we are from even meeting an air force
											willing to fly against ours.
											So that overmatched capability
creates problems —
											catastrophic successes
the White House calls them.

											And we&#39;re trying to figure that out,
											because it is an amazing capability.
											The question is, what&#39;s the good
you can do with it?
											OK?
											The theory of anti-access, area-denial
asymmetrical strategies —
											gobbledygook that we sell to Congress,
											because if we just told them
we can kick anybody&#39;s asses
											they wouldn&#39;t buy us
all the stuff we want.
											So we say, area-denial, anti-access
asymmetrical strategies
											and their eyes glaze over.

											There is no battle space the U.S.

											Going back to the beginning
of our country —
											historically, defenses meant
protection of the homeland.
											Security has meant everything else.
											Written into our constitution,
											two different forces,
two different functions.
											Raise an army when you need it,
											and maintain a navy
for day-to-day connectivity.
											A Department of War,
a Department of Everything Else.
											A big stick, a baton stick.

											In 1947 we merged these
