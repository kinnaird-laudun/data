<title>Jedidah Isler: The untapped genius that could change science for the better | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Jedidah Isler dreamt of becoming an astrophysicist since she was a young girl, but the odds were against her: At that time, only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD in a physics-related discipline. In this personal talk, she shares the story of how she became the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics from Yale -- and her deep belief in the value of diversity to science and other STEM fields. &quot;Do not think for one minute that because you are who you are, you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be,&quot; she says. &quot;Hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can&#39;t even imagine.&quot;" />

<meta content='Jedidah Isler dreamt of becoming an astrophysicist since she was a young girl, but the odds were against her: At that time, only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD in a physics-related discipline. In this personal talk, she shares the story of how she became the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics from Yale — and her deep belief in the value of diversity to science and other STEM fields. "Do not think for one minute that because you are who you are, you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be," she says. "Hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can&#x0027;t even imagine."' itemprop='description'>

											Great things happen at intersections.
											In fact, I would argue
that some of the most interesting things
											of the human experience
occur at the intersections,
											in the liminal space,
											where by liminal
I mean the space in-between.
											There&#39;s freedom in that in-between,
											freedom to create from the indefiniteness
of not-quite-here, not-quite-there,
											a new self-definition.
											Some of the great intersections
of the world come to mind,
											like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,
											or Times Square in New York City,
											both bustling with the excitement
of a seemingly endless stream of people.
											Other intersections,
											like the Edmund Pettus Bridge
in Selma, Alabama,
											or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court
in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind
											because of the tremendous energy
at the intersection of human beings,
											ideologies and the ongoing
struggle for justice.

											Beyond the physical
landscape of our planet,
											some of the most famous celestial images
are of intersections.
											Stars are born at the messy
intersection of gas and dust,
											instigated by gravity&#39;s irrevocable pull.
											Stars die by this same intersection,
this time flung outward
											in a violent collision of smaller atoms,
											intersecting and efficiently fusing
into altogether new and heavier things.
											We can all think of intersections
that have special meaning to us.
											To be intersectional, then,
											is to occupy a position
at an intersection.

of middle-class life
											and into the almost constant struggle
to make ends meet.
											Thus, I was one of roughly
60 percent of women of color
											who find finances to be a major barrier
to their educational goals.
											Thankfully, Norfolk State University
provided me with full funding,
											and I was able to achieve
my bachelor&#39;s in physics.

											After graduation, and despite knowing
that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,
											I fell through the cracks.
											It was a poster that saved my dream,
											and some really incredible
people and programs.
											The American Physical Society
had this beautiful poster
											encouraging students of color
to become physicists.
											It was striking to me
because it featured a young black girl,
											probably around 12 years old,
											looking studiously
at some physics equations.
											I remember thinking
											I was looking directly back
at the little girl
											who first dared to dream this dream.
											I immediately wrote to the Society
											and requested my personal
copy of the poster,
											which to this day
still hangs in my office.
											I described to them in the email
my educational path,
											and my desire to find myself again
in pursuit of the PhD.
											They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt
University Bridge Program,
											itself an intersection
of the master&#39;s and PhD degrees
											at two institutions.
											After two years out of school,
they accepted me into the program,
											and I found myself again
on the path to the PhD.

											It became immediately apparent
											that not everyone was thrilled
to have that degree of liminality
											in their space.
											I was ostracized by many of my classmates,
											one of whom went so far as to invite me
to &quot;do what I really came here to do&quot;
											as he pushed all the dirty dishes
from our meal in front of me to clean up.
											I wish that were an isolated occurrence,
											but for many women of color
											in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics, or STEM,
											this is something they have long endured.
											One hundred percent
of the 60 women of color
											interviewed in a recent study
by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings
											reported facing racialized gender bias,
											including being mistaken
for the janitorial staff.
											This mistaken identity was not reported
											by any of the white women
interviewed for this study,
											which comprised 557 women in total.
											While there is nothing inherently wrong
with a janitorial position,
											and in fact my forefathers and foremothers
were able to attend college
											because many of their parents
worked these jobs,
											it was a clear attempt
to put me in my place.

											While there was certainly
the acute pain of the encounter,
											the real issue is that my appearance
											can tell anyone anything about my ability.
											Beyond that, though, it underscores
											that the women of color in STEM
do not experience the same set of barriers
											that just women
or just people of color face.
											That&#39;s why today I want to highlight
women of color in STEM,
											who are inexorably, unapologetically
											living as the inseparable
sum of identities.

											STEM itself is an intersectional term,
											such that its true richness
cannot be appreciated
											without considering
the liminal space between disciplines.
											Science, the pursuit
of understanding the physical world
											by way of chemistry, physics, biology,
											cannot be accomplished
in the absence of mathematics.
											Engineering requires the application
of basic science and math
											to the lived experience.
											Technology sits firmly
on the foundation of math,
											engineering and science.
											Math itself serves
the critical role of Rosetta Stone,
											decoding and encoding
the physical principles of the world.
											STEM is utterly incomplete
without each individual piece.
											This is to say nothing
of the enrichment that is realized
											when STEM is combined
with other disciplines.

											The purpose for this talk is twofold:
											first, to say directly to every black,
Latina, indigenous, First Nation
											or any other woman or girl
											who finds herself resting
at the blessed intersection
											of race and gender,
											that you can be anything you want to be.
											My personal hope is
that you&#39;ll become an astrophysicist,
											but beyond that, anything you want.
											Do not think for one minute
											that because you are who you are,
											you cannot be
who you imagine yourself to be.
											Hold fast to those dreams
											and let them carry you
into a world you can&#39;t even imagine.

											Secondly, among the most
pressing issues of our time,
											most now find
their intersection with STEM.
											We have as a global society solved
											most of the single-faceted
issues of our time.
											Those that remain
require a thorough investigation
											of the liminal space between disciplines
											to create the multifaceted
solutions of tomorrow.
											Who better to solve these liminal problems
											than those who have faced
their whole lives at the intersections.
											We as thought leaders and decision makers
											must push past
the first steps of diversity
											and into the richer
and more robust territory
											of full inclusion and equal opportunity.

											One of my favorite examples
of liminal excellence
											comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander,
											a black woman plasma physicist,
											who passed away this past July
after a 10-year bout with breast cancer.
											She was a NASA project scientist
who spearheaded the NASA side
											of the Rosetta mission,
											which became famous this year
for landing a rover on a comet,
											and the 1.5 billion dollar
Galileo mission to Jupiter,
											two high-profile scientific victories
											for NASA, the United States
and the world.
											Dr. Alexander said it this way:
											&quot;I&#39;m used to walking between two cultures.
											For me, it&#39;s among the purposes of my life
											to take us from states of ignorance
to states of understanding
											with bold exploration
that you can&#39;t do every day.&quot;

in any place she was.

											Jessica Matthews, inventor
of the SOCCKET line of sports products,
											like soccer balls, that generate
renewable energy as you play with them,
											said it this way:
											&quot;A major part of invention
isn&#39;t just creating things,
											it&#39;s understanding people
											and understanding the systems
that make this world.&quot;
											The reason I tell my story
											and the story of Dr. Alexander

intersectional stories,
											the stories of lives lived at the nexus

But because neither her undergraduate college or the university where she got her first master&rsquo;s degree offered astronomy majors, she threw herself wholeheartedly into physics. It wasn&rsquo;t until she entered a doctoral program that she was able to dedicate her time to the studying the night sky. In 2014, she became the first African-American woman to receive a Ph.D in Astrophysics from Yale.</p> <p>Isler studies blazars &mdash; supermassive hyperactive black holes at the center of galaxies, some of which emit powerful streams of particles. Sometimes these are oriented toward Earth, offering us a unique perspective on the physics of the universe. Isler is a Chancellor&rsquo;s Faculty Fellow in Physics at Syracuse University. She participates in the Future Faculty Leader program at Harvard&#39;s Center for Astrophysics and was named a 2015 TED Fellow.</p> <p>Isler is also interested in breaking down barriers that prevent many students &mdash; especially women of color &mdash; from becoming scienists. She works to make STEM accessible to new communities.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jedidah Isler","tags":["TED Fellows","astronomy","future","goal-setting","identity","inequality","physics","potential","race","science","society","space","universe","women"],"title":"The untapped genius that could change science for the better","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1787573}]}
