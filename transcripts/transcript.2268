<title>Hector Garcia: We train soldiers for war. Let&#39;s train them to come home, too | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Before soldiers are sent into combat, they&#39;re trained on how to function in an immensely dangerous environment. But they also need training on how to return from the battlefield to civilian life, says psychologist Hector Garcia. Applying the same principles used to prepare soldiers for war, Garcia is helping veterans suffering from PTSD get their lives back." />

											Carlos,
											the Vietnam vet Marine
											who volunteered for three tours
and got shot up in every one.
											In 1971, he was medically retired
											because he had so much
shrapnel in his body
											that he was setting off metal detectors.
											For the next 42 years,
he suffered from nightmares,
											extreme anxiety in public,
											isolation, depression.
											He self-medicated with alcohol.
											He was married and divorced three times.
											Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.

									<p>
											Now, I became a psychologist
to help mitigate human suffering,
											and for the past 10 years, my target
has been the suffering caused by PTSD,
											as experienced by veterans like Carlos.
											Until recently, the science of PTSD
just wasn&#39;t there.
											And so, we didn&#39;t know what to do.
											We put some veterans on heavy drugs.
											Others we hospitalized
and gave generic group therapy,
											and others still we simply said to them,
											&quot;Just go home and try to forget
about your experiences.&quot;
											More recently, we&#39;ve tried therapy dogs,
wilderness retreats —
											many things which may
temporarily relieve stress,
											but which don&#39;t actually eliminate
PTSD symptoms over the long term.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But things have changed.
											And I am here to tell you
that we can now eliminate PTSD,
											not just manage the symptoms,
											and in huge numbers of veterans.
											Because new scientific research
has been able to show,
											objectively, repeatedly,
											which treatments actually
get rid of symptoms and which do not.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now as it turns out,
											the best treatments for PTSD use
many of the very same training principles
											that the military uses
in preparing its trainees for war.

											Now, making war —
											this is something that we are good at.
											We humans have been making war
since before we were even fully human.
											And since then, we have gone
from using stone and sinew
											to developing the most sophisticated
and devastating weapon systems imaginable.
											And to enable our warriors
to use these weapons,
											we employ the most cutting-edge
training methods.
											We are good at making war.
											And we are good at training
our warriors to fight.

									<p>
											Yet, when we consider the experience
of the modern-day combat veteran,
											we begin to see that we
have not been as good
											at preparing them to come home.
											Why is that?
											Well, our ancestors lived
immersed in conflict,
											and they fought right where they lived.
											So until only very recently
in our evolutionary history,
											there was hardly a need to learn
how to come home from war,
											because we never really did.
											But thankfully, today,
											most of humanity lives
in far more peaceful societies,
											and when there is conflict,
we, especially in the United States,
											now have the technology to put

											But just imagine for a moment
what this must feel like.
											I&#39;ve spoken with veterans who&#39;ve told me

firefight in Afghanistan

											and just three days later,
they found themselves

to their kid&#39;s soccer game.

									<p>
											It&#39;s the most common term
I&#39;ve heard to describe that experience.
											And that&#39;s exactly what that is.
											Because while our warriors
spend countless hours training for war,
											we&#39;ve only recently come to understand
											that many require training
on how to return to civilian life.

											Now, like any training, the best
PTSD treatments require repetition.
											In the military,
											we don&#39;t simply hand trainees
Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers
											and say, &quot;Here&#39;s the trigger,
here&#39;s some ammo and good luck.&quot;
											No. We train them, on the range
and in specific contexts,
											over and over and over
											until lifting their weapon
and engaging their target
											is so engrained into muscle memory
											that it can be performed
without even thinking,
											even under the most stressful

											Now, the same holds
for training-based treatments.
											The first of these treatments
is cognitive therapy,
											and this is a kind
of mental recalibration.
											When veterans come home from war,
											their way of mentally framing
the world is calibrated
											to an immensely
more dangerous environment.
											So when you try to overlay that mind frame
onto a peacetime environment,
											you get problems.
											You begin drowning in worries
about dangers that aren&#39;t present.
											You begin not trusting family or friends.
											Which is not to say there are no
dangers in civilian life; there are.
											It&#39;s just that the probability
of encountering them
											compared to combat
											is astronomically lower.

											So we never advise veterans
to turn off caution completely.
											We do train them, however,
to adjust caution
											according to where they are.
											If you find yourself
in a bad neighborhood,
											you turn it up.
											Out to dinner with family?
											You turn it way down.
											We train veterans to be fiercely rational,
											to systematically gauge
the actual statistical probability
											of encountering, say, an IED
here in peacetime America.
											With enough practice,
those recalibrations stick.

											You remember Carlos?
											This was the treatment that he chose.
											And so we started off
by giving him exercises,
											for him, challenging ones:
											going to a grocery store,
											going to a shopping mall,
going to a restaurant,
											sitting with his back to the door.
											And, critically —
											staying in these environments.
											Now, at first he was very anxious.
											He wanted to sit
where he could scan the room,
											where he could plan escape routes,
											where he could get his hands
on a makeshift weapon.
											And he wanted to leave, but he didn&#39;t.
											He remembered his training
in the Marine Corps,
											and he pushed through his discomfort.
											And every time he did this,
his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,
											and then a little bit more
and then a little bit more,
											until in the end,
											he had effectively relearned
how to sit in a public space
											and just enjoy himself.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											He also listened to recordings
of his combat experiences,
											over and over and over.
											He listened until those memories
no longer generated any anxiety.
											He processed his memories so much
											that his brain no longer needed
to return to those experiences
											in his sleep.
											And when I spoke with him
a year after treatment had finished,
											he told me,
											&quot;Doc, this is the first time in 43 years
											that I haven&#39;t had nightmares.&quot;

									<p>
											Now, this is different
than erasing a memory.
											Veterans will always remember
their traumatic experiences,
											but with enough practice,
											those memories are no longer as raw
or as painful as they once were.
											They don&#39;t feel emotionally
like they just happened yesterday,
											and that is an immensely
better place to be.

											But it&#39;s often difficult.
											And, like any training,
it may not work for everybody.
											And there are trust issues.
											Sometimes I&#39;m asked,
											&quot;If you haven&#39;t been there, Doc,
how can you help me?&quot;
											Which is understandable.
											But at the point of returning
to civilian life,
											you do not require
somebody who&#39;s been there.
											You don&#39;t require training

											For the past 10 years of my work,

that you can imagine,
											daily.
											And it hasn&#39;t always been easy.
											There have been times

											Carlos can now enjoy outings
with his grandchildren,
											which is something he couldn&#39;t even do
with his own children.
											And what&#39;s amazing to me
is that after 43 years of suffering,
											it only took him 10 weeks
of intense training to get his life back.
											And when I spoke with him, he told me,
											&quot;I know that I can&#39;t get those years back.
											But at least now, whatever days
that I have left on this Earth,
											I can live them in peace.&quot;
											He also said, &quot;I hope that these
younger veterans don&#39;t wait
											to get the help they need.&quot;
											And that&#39;s my hope, too.
											Because ...
											this life is short,
											and if you are fortunate enough
to have survived war
											or any kind of traumatic experience,
											you owe it to yourself
to live your life well.

Garcia has written a brilliant, courageous, and vitally important book about the widespread belief in a single, all-powerful god. Specifically, he has traced that belief to--brace yourselves--our primate origins. Given the fact that religious differences underlie almost all of the world's bloody conflicts, this might be one of the most important topics anyone could tackle. Garcia's research is impeccable, his thesis is staggeringly original, and he writes with breathtaking clarity and insight. It's been a long time since a book has stunned me like this one has.\r\n","whotheyare":"Hector A.
