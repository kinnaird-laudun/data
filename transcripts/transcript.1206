											As a kid, I grew up on a farm in Florida,
											and I did what most little kids do.
											I played a little baseball,
did a few other things like that,
											but I always had the sense
of being an outsider,
											and it wasn&#39;t until I saw
pictures in the magazines
											that a couple other guys skate, I thought,
											&quot;Wow, that&#39;s for me,&quot; you know?
											Because there was no coach
standing directly over you,
											and these guys,
they were just being themselves.
											There was no opponent
directly across from you.
											And I loved that sense,
so I started skating
											when I was about 10 years old, in 1977,
											and when I did,
I picked it up pretty quickly.
											In fact, here&#39;s some footage
from about 1984.
											It wasn&#39;t until 79
I won my first amateur championship,
											and then, by 81, I was 14,
and I won my first world championship,
											which was amazing to me,
											and in a very real sense,
that was the first real victory I had.

											And this one here?
											An ollie.
											So, as she mentioned,
that is overstated for sure,

the godfather of modern street skating.
											Here&#39;s some images of that.

											Now, I was about halfway
through my pro career
											in, I would say, the mid-&#39;80s.
											Freestyle itself — we developed
all these flat ground tricks, as you saw,
											but there was evolving
a new kind of skateboarding,
											where guys were taking it to the streets,
and they were using that ollie,
											like I showed you.
											They were using it to get up
onto stuff like bleachers and handrails
											and over stairwells
and all kinds of cool stuff.
											So it was evolving upwards.
											In fact, when someone tells you
they&#39;re a skater today,
											they pretty much mean a street skater,
											because freestyle, it took about
five years for it to die,
											and at that stage, I&#39;d been a &quot;champion&quot;
champion for 11 years, which —
											Phew!
											And suddenly, it was over for me,
that&#39;s it — it was gone.
											They took my pro model off the shelf,
											which was essentially
pronouncing you dead, publicly.
											That&#39;s how you make your money, you know?
											You have a signature board
and wheels and shoes and clothes.
											I had all that stuff, and it&#39;s gone.

skateboarding, the freedom,

was for me, always,
											was creating new stuff.
											The other thing that I had
was a deep well of tricks to draw from

in these flat ground tricks.

was very much different.

											So, humbling as it was, I began again.
											Here are some tricks that I started
to bring to that new terrain.
											And again, there&#39;s this undergirding
layer of influence of freestyle —
											Oh, that one?
											That&#39;s, like, the hardest
thing I&#39;ve ever done.
											OK, look at that, it&#39;s a Darkslide.
											See how it&#39;s sliding on the backside?
											Those are super fun,
and, actually, not that hard.
											You know, at the very root
of that, see, Caspers,
											see how you throw it?
											Simple as that, right? No biggie.
											And your front foot,
the way it grabs it —
											I&#39;d seen someone slide
on the back of the board like that,
											and I was like, &quot;How can I get it over?&quot;
											Because that had not yet been done.
											And then it dawned on me,
and here&#39;s part of what I&#39;m saying.
											I had an infrastructure.
I had this deep layer,
											where it was like, oh my gosh,
it&#39;s just your foot.
											It&#39;s just the way
you throw your board over.
											Just let the ledge do that, and it&#39;s easy,
											and the next thing you know,
there&#39;s 20 more tricks
											based out of the variations.

									<p>
											So that&#39;s the kind of thing —
here, check this out,
											here&#39;s another way,
and I won&#39;t overdo this.
											A little indulgent, I understand.
											There&#39;s something called a Primo slide.
											It is the funnest trick ever to do.
											It&#39;s like skimboarding.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And this one, look how it slides
sideways, every which way?
											OK, so when you&#39;re skating,
and you take a fall,
											the board slips that way or that way;
it&#39;s kind of predictable.
											This? It goes every which way —
it&#39;s like a cartoon, the falls,
											and that&#39;s what I love the most about it.
											It&#39;s so much fun to do.
											In fact, when I started doing them,
I remember, because I got hurt.
											I had to get a knee surgery, right?
											So there were a couple of weeks
where I couldn&#39;t skate at all.
											It would give out on me,
and I would watch the guys,
											I&#39;d go to this warehouse
where a lot of the guys were skating,
											my friends, and I was like,
											&quot;I&#39;ve got to do something new,
I want to do something new.
											I want to start fresh.&quot;
											And so the night before my surgery,
I&#39;d watched, and I was like,
											&quot;How am I going to do this?&quot;
											So I ran up, and I jumped on my board,
											and I Cavemanned, and I flipped it down,
											and I remember thinking,
I landed so light-footed, thinking,
											if my knee gives, they&#39;ll just have
more work to do in the morning.

to do bank tricks, right?
											But there&#39;s this other aspect
of it for wheelies,
											so check this out.
											There&#39;s a few tricks, again,
											how environment changes
the nature of your tricks.
											Freestyle oriented,
manual down — wheelie down.
											Watch, this one? Oh, I love this,
it&#39;s like surfing, this one,
											the way you catch it.
											This one, a little sketchy
going backwards,
											and watch the back foot.

											Skateboarding is such
a humbling thing, man.
											No matter how good you are,
you&#39;ve still got to deal with —
											So you hit this wall, and when I hit it,
											the first thing you do
is you fall forward,
											and I&#39;m like, all right, all right.
											As you adjust ...
											you punch it up,
and then when I would do that,
											it was throwing my shoulder this way ...
											which as I was doing it, I was like,
&quot;Oh wow, that&#39;s begging for a 360 flip,&quot;
											because that&#39;s how
you load up for a 360 flip.

									<p>
											And so this is what I want
to emphasize that, as you can imagine,
											all of these tricks are made
of submovements,
											executive motor functions,
											more granular to the degree
to which I can&#39;t quite tell you,
											but one thing I do know is,
											every trick is made of combining two
or three or four or five movements.
											And so, as I&#39;m going up,
these things are floating around,
											and you have to sort of
let the cognitive mind rest back,
											pull it back a little bit,
											and let your intuition go
as you feel these things.
											And these submovements
are kind of floating around,
											and as the wall hits you,
they connect themselves to an extent,
											and that&#39;s when the cognitive mind:
&quot;Oh, 360 flip, I&#39;m going to make that.&quot;
											So that&#39;s how that works
to me, the creative process,
											the process itself, of street skating.

											And skaters, I think
they tend to be outsiders
											who seek a sense of belonging,
											but belonging on their own terms.
											And real respect is given
by how much we take what other guys do,
											these basic tricks, 360 flips,
we take that, we make it our own,
											and then we contribute
back to the community
											the inner way that edifies
the community itself.
											The greater the contribution,
											the more we express
and form our individuality,
											which is so important to a lot of us
who feel like rejects to begin with.
											The summation of that
											gives us something we could never
achieve as an individual.
											I should say this.
											There&#39;s some sort of beautiful symmetry

we connect to a community

											Next,
											and this is something deeper.
											I think I was on tour when I was reading
one of the Feynman biographies.
											It was the red one or the blue one.
											And he made this statement
that was so profound to me.
											It was that the Nobel Prize
was the tombstone on all great work,
											and it resonated because
I had won 35 out of 36 contests
											that I&#39;d entered over 11 years,
and it made me bananas.
											In fact, winning
isn&#39;t the word, I won it once.
											The rest of the time,
you&#39;re just defending,
											and you get into this,
turtle posture, you know?
											Where you&#39;re not doing —
it usurped the joy of what I loved to do
											because I was no longer doing it
to create and have fun,
											and when it died out from under me,
											that was one of the most
liberating things,
											because I could create.

											And look, I understand that
I am on the very edge of preachy, here.
											I&#39;m not here to do that.
											It&#39;s just that I&#39;m in front
of a very privileged audience.
											If you guys aren&#39;t already
leaders in your community,
											you probably will be,
and if there&#39;s anything I can give you
											that will transcend what I&#39;ve gotten
from skateboarding,
											the only things of meaning,
I think, and of permanence,
											it&#39;s not fame, it&#39;s not all these things.
											What it is, is that there&#39;s
an intrinsic value in creating something
											for the sake of creating it,
											and better than that,
because I&#39;m 46 years old, or I&#39;ll be 46,
											and how pathetic is that
I&#39;m still skateboarding, but there is —
											there is this beauty in dropping it
into a community of your own making,
											and seeing it dispersed,
and seeing younger, more talented,
											just different talent, take it to levels
you can never imagine,
											because that lives on.
											So thank you for your time.

Despite initial objections, his father eventually gave in and purchased Rodney&#39;s first skateboard in 1977, when he was ten years old, on the condition that he would always wear his safety pads and stop skating the moment he was injured. That same year he entered his first contest and came in third; then, over the next three years, he would place first in every contest he entered -- nearly thirty in all. In 1980, after winning the Oasis Pro competition in San Diego, Rodney began his professional skating career with the Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade. He would go on to invent tricks, like the flat-ground ollie, Kicklip, Heelflip, and 360 Flip that would completely revolutionize the art of skating. In 2002, Mullen won the Transworld Readers&#39; Choice Award for Skater of the Year and founded the Almost skateboard company. In 2003, he wrote an autobiography titled&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/themutt\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Mutt: How to Skateboard and Not Kill Yourself</em></a>.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/rodney_mullen_pop_an_ollie_and_innovate","viewed_count":996423,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"Rodney Mullen is the godfather of street skating, and in this exuberant talk he shares his love of the open skateboarding community.

Despite initial objections, his father eventually gave in and purchased Rodney&#39;s first skateboard in 1977, when he was ten years old, on the condition that he would always wear his safety pads and stop skating the moment he was injured. That same year he entered his first contest and came in third; then, over the next three years, he would place first in every contest he entered -- nearly thirty in all. In 1980, after winning the Oasis Pro competition in San Diego, Rodney began his professional skating career with the Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade. He would go on to invent tricks, like the flat-ground ollie, Kicklip, Heelflip, and 360 Flip that would completely revolutionize the art of skating. In 2002, Mullen won the Transworld Readers&#39; Choice Award for Skater of the Year and founded the Almost skateboard company. In 2003, he wrote an autobiography titled&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/themutt\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Mutt: How to Skateboard and Not Kill Yourself</em></a>.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Rodney Mullen","tags":["TEDx","collaboration","innovation","open-source","skateboarding"],"title":"Pop an ollie and innovate!","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":996423}]}
