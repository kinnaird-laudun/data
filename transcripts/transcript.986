											The night before I was heading for Scotland,
											I was invited to host the final
											of &quot;China&#39;s Got Talent&quot; show in Shanghai
											with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.
											Guess who was the performing guest?
											Susan Boyle.
											And I told her, &quot;I&#39;m going to Scotland the next day.&quot;
											She sang beautifully,
											and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:
											送你葱
											So it&#39;s not like &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;thank you,&quot;
											that ordinary stuff.
											It means &quot;green onion for free.&quot;
											Why did she say that?
											Because it was a line
											from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle —
											a 50-some year-old woman,
											a vegetable vendor in Shanghai,
											who loves singing Western opera,
											but she didn&#39;t understand
											any English or French or Italian,
											so she managed to fill in the lyrics
											with vegetable names in Chinese.
											(Laughter)
											And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma
											that she was singing in the stadium
											was &quot;green onion for free.&quot;
											So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that,
											80,000 live audience sang together.
											That was hilarious.

									<p>
											So I guess both Susan Boyle
											and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai
											belonged to otherness.
											They were the least expected to be successful
											in the business called entertainment,
											yet their courage and talent brought them through.
											And a show and a platform
											gave them the stage
											to realize their dreams.
											Well, being different is not that difficult.
											We are all different
											from different perspectives.
											But I think being different is good,
											because you present a different point of view.
											You may have the chance to make a difference.

											My generation has been very fortunate
											to witness and participate
											in the historic transformation of China
											that has made so many changes
											in the past 20, 30 years.
											I remember that in the year of 1990,
											when I was graduating from college,
											I was applying for a job in the sales department
											of the first five-star hotel in Beijing,
											Great Wall Sheraton — it&#39;s still there.
											So after being interrogated
											by this Japanese manager for a half an hour,
											he finally said,
											&quot;So, Miss Yang,
											do you have any questions to ask me?&quot;
											I summoned my courage and poise and said,
											&quot;Yes, but could you let me know,
											what actually do you sell?&quot;
											I didn&#39;t have a clue what a sales department was about
											in a five-star hotel.
											That was the first day I set my foot
											in a five-star hotel.

											Around the same time,
											I was going through an audition —
											the first ever open audition
											by national television in China —
											with another thousand college girls.
											The producer told us
											they were looking for some sweet, innocent
											and beautiful fresh face.
											So when it was my turn, I stood up and said,
											&quot;Why [do] women&#39;s personalities on television
											always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent
											and, you know, supportive?
											Why can&#39;t they have their own ideas
											and their own voice?&quot;
											I thought I kind of offended them.
											But actually, they were impressed by my words.
											And so I was in the second round of competition,
											and then the third and the fourth.
											After seven rounds of competition,
											I was the last one to survive it.
											So I was on a national television prime-time show.
											And believe it or not,
											that was the first show on Chinese television
											that allowed its hosts
											to speak out of their own minds
											without reading an approved script.
											(Applause)
											And my weekly audience at that time
											was between 200 to 300 million people.

											Well after a few years,
											I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University
											to pursue my postgraduate studies,
											and then started my own media company,
											which was unthought of
											during the years that I started my career.
											So we do a lot of things.
											I&#39;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.
											And sometimes I have young people approaching me
											say, &quot;Lan, you changed my life,&quot;
											and I feel proud of that.
											But then we are also so fortunate
											to witness the transformation of the whole country.
											I was in Beijing&#39;s bidding for the Olympic Games.
											I was representing the Shanghai Expo.
											I saw China embracing the world
											and vice versa.
											But then sometimes I&#39;m thinking,
											what are today&#39;s young generation up to?
											How are they different,
											and what are the differences they are going to make
											to shape the future of China,
											or at large, the world?

											First of all, who are they? [What] do they look like?
											Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei —
											20 years old, beautiful.
											She showed off her expensive bags,
											clothes and car
											on her microblog,
											which is the Chinese version of Twitter.
											And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross
											at the Chamber of Commerce.
											She didn&#39;t realize
											that she stepped on a sensitive nerve
											and aroused national questioning,
											almost a turmoil,
											against the credibility of Red Cross.
											The controversy was so heated
											that the Red Cross had to open a press conference
											to clarify it,
											and the investigation is going on.

											So far, as of today,
											we know that she herself made up that title —
											probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.
											All those expensive items
											were given to her as gifts
											by her boyfriend,
											who used to be a board member
											in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.
											It&#39;s very complicated to explain.
											But anyway, the public still doesn&#39;t buy it.
											It is still boiling.
											It shows us a general mistrust
											of government or government-backed institutions,
											which lacked transparency in the past.
											And also it showed us
											the power and the impact of social media
											as microblog.

											Microblog boomed in the year of 2010,
											with visitors doubled
											and time spent on it tripled.
											Sina.com, a major news portal,
											alone has more than 140 million microbloggers.
											On Tencent, 200 million.
											The most popular blogger —
											it&#39;s not me —
											it&#39;s a movie star,
											and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.
											About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people,
											under 30 years old.
											And because, as you know,
											the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government,
											social media offers an opening
											to let the steam out a little bit.
											But because you don&#39;t have many other openings,
											the heat coming out of this opening
											is sometimes very strong, active
											and even violent.

											So through microblogging,
											we are able to understand Chinese youth even better.
											So how are they different?
											First of all, most of them were born
											in the 80s and 90s,
											under the one-child policy.
											And because of selected abortion
											by families who favored boys to girls,
											now we have ended up
											with 30 million more young men than women.
											That could pose
											a potential danger to the society,
											but who knows;
											we&#39;re in a globalized world,
											so they can look for girlfriends from other countries.
											Most of them have fairly good education.
											The illiteracy rate in China among this generation
											is under one percent.
											In cities, 80 percent of kids go to college.
											But they are facing an aging China
											with a population above 65 years old
											coming up with seven-point-some percent this year,
											and about to be 15 percent
											by the year of 2030.
											And you know we have the tradition
											that younger generations support the elders financially,
											and taking care of them when they&#39;re sick.
											So it means young couples
											will have to support four parents
											who have a life expectancy of 73 years old.

											So making a living is not that easy
											for young people.
											College graduates are not in short supply.
											In urban areas,
											college graduates find the starting salary
											is about 400 U.S. dollars a month,
											while the average rent
											is above $500.
											So what do they do? They have to share space —
											squeezed in very limited space
											to save money —
											and they call themselves &quot;tribe of ants.&quot;
											And for those who are ready to get married
											and buy their apartment,
											they figured out they have to work
											for 30 to 40 years
											to afford their first apartment.
											That ratio in America
											would only cost a couple five years to earn,
											but in China it&#39;s 30 to 40 years
											with the skyrocketing real estate price.

											Among the 200 million migrant workers,
											60 percent of them are young people.
											They find themselves sort of sandwiched
											between the urban areas and the rural areas.
											Most of them don&#39;t want to go back to the countryside,
											but they don&#39;t have the sense of belonging.
											They work for longer hours
											with less income, less social welfare.
											And they&#39;re more vulnerable
											to job losses,
											subject to inflation,
											tightening loans from banks,
											appreciation of the renminbi,
											or decline of demand
											from Europe or America
											for the products they produce.
											Last year, though,
											an appalling incident
											in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China:
											13 young workers
											in their late teens and early 20s
											committed suicide,
											just one by one like causing a contagious disease.
											But they died because of all different personal reasons.
											But this whole incident
											aroused a huge outcry from society
											about the isolation,
											both physical and mental,
											of these migrant workers.

											For those who do return back to the countryside,
											they find themselves very welcome locally,
											because with the knowledge, skills and networks
											they have learned in the cities,
											with the assistance of the Internet,
											they&#39;re able to create more jobs,
											upgrade local agriculture and create new business
											in the less developed market.
											So for the past few years, the coastal areas,

											These diagrams show
											a more general social background.
											The first one is the Engels coefficient,
											which explains that the cost of daily necessities
											has dropped its percentage
											all through the past decade,
											in terms of family income,
											to about 37-some percent.
											But then in the last two years,
											it goes up again to 39 percent,
											indicating a rising living cost.
											The Gini coefficient
											has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4.
											Now it&#39;s 0.5 —
											even worse than that in America —
											showing us the income inequality.
											And so you see this whole society
											getting frustrated
											about losing some of its mobility.
											And also, the bitterness and even resentment
											towards the rich and the powerful
											is quite widespread.
											So any accusations of corruption
											or backdoor dealings between authorities or business
											would arouse a social outcry
											or even unrest.

											So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging,
											we can see what young people care most about.
											Social justice and government accountability
											runs the first in what they demand.
											For the past decade or so,
											a massive urbanization and development
											have let us witness a lot of reports
											on the forced demolition
											of private property.
											And it has aroused huge anger and frustration
											among our young generation.
											Sometimes people get killed,
											and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest.
											So when these incidents are reported
											more and more frequently on the Internet,
											people cry for the government to take actions to stop this.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

											So the good news is that earlier this year,
											the state council passed a new regulation
											on house requisition and demolition
											and passed the right
											to order forced demolition from local governments
											to the court.
											Similarly, many other issues concerning public safety
											is a hot topic on the Internet.
											We heard about polluted air,
											polluted water, poisoned food.
											And guess what, we have faked beef.
											They have sorts of ingredients
											that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish,
											and it turns it to look like beef.
											And then lately,
											people are very concerned about cooking oil,
											because thousands of people have been found
											[refining] cooking oil
											from restaurant slop.
											So all these things
											have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet.
											And fortunately,
											we have seen the government
											responding more timely and also more frequently
											to the public concerns.

											While young people seem to be very sure
											about their participation
											in public policy-making,
											but sometimes they&#39;re a little bit lost
											in terms of what they want for their personal life.
											China is soon to pass the U.S.
											as the number one market
											for luxury brands —
											that&#39;s not including the Chinese expenditures
											in Europe and elsewhere.
											But you know what, half of those consumers
											are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.
											They&#39;re not rich at all.
											They&#39;re taking those bags and clothes
											as a sense of identity and social status.
											And this is a girl explicitly saying
											on a TV dating show
											that she would rather cry in a BMW
											than smile on a bicycle.
											But of course, we do have young people
											who would still prefer to smile,
											whether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle.

											So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon
											called &quot;naked&quot; wedding, or &quot;naked&quot; marriage.
											It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding,
											but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married
											without a house, without a car, without a diamond ring
											and without a wedding banquet,
											to show their commitment to true love.
											And also, people are doing good through social media.
											And the first picture showed us
											that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs
											for food processing
											was spotted and stopped on the highway
											with the whole country watching
											through microblogging.
											People were donating money, dog food
											and offering volunteer work to stop that truck.
											And after hours of negotiation,
											500 dogs were rescued.
											And here also people are helping to find missing children.
											A father posted his son&#39;s picture onto the Internet.
											After thousands of resends in relay,
											the child was found,
											and we witnessed the reunion of the family
											through microblogging.

											So happiness is the most popular word
											we have heard through the past two years.
											Happiness is not only related
											to personal experiences and personal values,
											but also, it&#39;s about the environment.
											People are thinking about the following questions:
											Are we going to sacrifice our environment further
											to produce higher GDP?
											How are we going to perform our social and political reform
											to keep pace with economic growth,
											to keep sustainability and stability?
											And also, how capable is the system
											of self-correctness
											to keep more people content
											with all sorts of friction going on at the same time?
											I guess these are the questions people are going to answer.
											And our younger generation
											are going to transform this country
											while at the same time being transformed themselves.
