<title>Caitlin Quattromani and Lauran Arledge: How our friendship survives our opposing politics | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Can you still be friends with someone who doesn&#39;t vote the same way as you? For Caitlin Quattromani and Lauran Arledge, two best friends who think very differently about politics, the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election could have resulted in hostility and disrespect. Hear about how they chose to engage in dialogue instead -- and learn some simple tactics they&#39;re using to maintain their bipartisan friendship." />

											Caitlin Quattromani: The election
of 2016 felt different.
											Political conversations
with our family and friends
											uncovered a level of polarization
											that many of us had not
previously experienced.
											People who we always thought
were reasonable and intelligent
											seemed like strangers.
											We said to ourselves,
&quot;How could you think that?
											I thought you were smart.&quot;

											Lauran Arledge: Caitlin and I met
in the summer of 2011,
											and we bonded around being working moms

our very energetic boys busy.
											And we soon found out
we had almost everything in common.
											From our love of Colorado
to our love of sushi,
											there wasn&#39;t much we didn&#39;t agree on.
											We also discovered that we share
a deep love of this country
											and feel a responsibility
to be politically active.

were getting to know each other,

of that 2012 presidential campaign,

political conversations

in jokes and pranks.

are a zero-sum game.

a weakness in someone&#39;s argument.

											we tend to take every comment
or opinion that&#39;s expressed
											as a personal affront
to our own values and beliefs.
											But what if changed the way
we think about these conversations?
											What if, in these heated moments,
											we chose dialogue over debate?
											When we engage in dialogue,
we flip the script.
											We replace our ego and our desire to win

											and a desire to learn.

from a place of judgment,

of true dialogue is hard,

about politics.
											It is so easy to get emotionally fired up
											about issues that we&#39;re passionate about,
											and we can let our ego
get in the way of truly hearing
											the other person&#39;s perspective.
											And in this crazy political climate
we&#39;re in right now,
											unfortunately, we&#39;re seeing
an extreme result
											of those heated political conversations,
											to the point where people are willing
to walk away from their relationships.
											In fact, Rasmussen released
a poll earlier this year
											that said 40 percent of people
reported that the 2016 election
											negatively impacted
a personal relationship,
											and the Journal of Cognitive
Neuroscience tells us
											that people tend to feel
their way to their beliefs
											rather than using reasoning,
											and that when reason and emotion collide,
											it&#39;s emotion that invariably wins.

to talk about these issues.

											As a conservative woman,
											the march&#39;s platform of issues
didn&#39;t represent me,

											but hearing it talked about
as this demonstration of sisterhood
											and solidarity for all women
											didn&#39;t ring true for me.
											The other piece
was the timing of the event,
											the fact that it was the day
after the presidential inauguration.
											It felt like we weren&#39;t even
giving the new administration
											to actually do anything, good or bad,

to demonstrate against it.

does deserve the benefit of the doubt.

to show my concern

very interesting family conversations.

we have the right and the privilege

something we don&#39;t agree with,

why he thought it was so important

we marched as a family
											is that it was a way for us to honor
my parents&#39; legacy.
											They spent their careers
											working to defend the rights
of some of our most vulnerable citizens,

down to me and my brother,
