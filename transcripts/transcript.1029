											My subject today is learning.
											And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.
											Ready?
											When does learning begin?
											Now as you ponder that question,
											maybe you&#39;re thinking about the first day of preschool
											or kindergarten,
											the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.
											Or maybe you&#39;ve called to mind the toddler phase
											when children are learning how to walk and talk
											and use a fork.
											Maybe you&#39;ve encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,
											which asserts that the most important years for learning
											are the earliest ones.
											And so your answer to my question would be:
											Learning begins at birth.

											Well today I want to present to you
											an idea that may be surprising
											and may even seem implausible,
											but which is supported by the latest evidence
											from psychology and biology.
											And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do
											happens before we&#39;re born,
											while we&#39;re still in the womb.
											Now I&#39;m a science reporter.
											I write books and magazine articles.
											And I&#39;m also a mother.
											And those two roles came together for me
											in a book that I wrote called &quot;Origins.&quot;
											&quot;Origins&quot; is a report from the front lines
											of an exciting new field
											called fetal origins.
											Fetal origins is a scientific discipline
											that emerged just about two decades ago,
											and it&#39;s based on the theory
											that our health and well-being throughout our lives
											is crucially affected
											by the nine months we spend in the womb.
											Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.
											I was myself pregnant
											while I was doing the research for the book.
											And one of the most fascinating insights
											I took from this work
											is that we&#39;re all learning about the world
											even before we enter it.

											When we hold our babies for the first time,
											we might imagine that they&#39;re clean slates,
											unmarked by life,
											when in fact, they&#39;ve already been shaped by us
											and by the particular world we live in.
											Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things
											that scientists are discovering
											about what fetuses learn
											while they&#39;re still in their mothers&#39; bellies.

											First of all,
											they learn the sound of their mothers&#39; voices.
											Because sounds from the outside world
											have to travel through the mother&#39;s abdominal tissue
											and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus,
											the voices fetuses hear,
											starting around the fourth month of gestation,
											are muted and muffled.
											One researcher says
											that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown&#39;s teacher
											in the old &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoon.
											But the pregnant woman&#39;s own voice
											reverberates through her body,
											reaching the fetus much more readily.
											And because the fetus is with her all the time,
											it hears her voice a lot.
											Once the baby&#39;s born, it recognizes her voice
											and it prefers listening to her voice
											over anyone else&#39;s.

											How can we know this?
											Newborn babies can&#39;t do much,
											but one thing they&#39;re really good at is sucking.
											Researchers take advantage of this fact
											by rigging up two rubber nipples,
											so that if a baby sucks on one,
											it hears a recording of its mother&#39;s voice
											on a pair of headphones,
											and if it sucks on the other nipple,
											it hears a recording of a female stranger&#39;s voice.
											Babies quickly show their preference
											by choosing the first one.
											Scientists also take advantage of the fact
											that babies will slow down their sucking
											when something interests them
											and resume their fast sucking
											when they get bored.
											This is how researchers discovered
											that, after women repeatedly read aloud
											a section of Dr. Seuss&#39; &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; while they were pregnant,
											their newborn babies recognized that passage
											when they hear it outside the womb.
											My favorite experiment of this kind
											is the one that showed that the babies
											of women who watched a certain soap opera
											every day during pregnancy
											recognized the theme song of that show
											once they were born.
											So fetuses are even learning
											about the particular language that&#39;s spoken
											in the world that they&#39;ll be born into.

											A study published last year
											found that from birth, from the moment of birth,
											babies cry in the accent
											of their mother&#39;s native language.
											French babies cry on a rising note
											while German babies end on a falling note,
											imitating the melodic contours
											of those languages.
											Now why would this kind of fetal learning
											be useful?
											It may have evolved to aid the baby&#39;s survival.
											From the moment of birth,
											the baby responds most to the voice
											of the person who is most likely to care for it —
											its mother.
											It even makes its cries
											sound like the mother&#39;s language,
											which may further endear the baby to the mother,
											and which may give the baby a head start
											in the critical task
											of learning how to understand and speak
											its native language.

											But it&#39;s not just sounds
											that fetuses are learning about in utero.
											It&#39;s also tastes and smells.
											By seven months of gestation,
											the fetus&#39; taste buds are fully developed,
											and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,
											are functioning.
											The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats
											find their way into the amniotic fluid,
											which is continuously swallowed
											by the fetus.
											Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes
											once they&#39;re out in the world.
											In one experiment, a group of pregnant women
											was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice
											during their third trimester of pregnancy,
											while another group of pregnant women
											drank only water.
											Six months later, the women&#39;s infants
											were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice,
											and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.
											The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women
											ate more carrot-flavored cereal,
											and from the looks of it,
											they seemed to enjoy it more.

											A sort of French version of this experiment
											was carried out in Dijon, France
											where researchers found
											that mothers who consumed food and drink
											flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy
											showed a preference for anise
											on their first day of life,
											and again, when they were tested later,
											on their fourth day of life.
											Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy
											showed a reaction that translated roughly as &quot;yuck.&quot;
											What this means
											is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers
											about what is safe and good to eat.
											Fetuses are also being taught
											about the particular culture that they&#39;ll be joining
											through one of culture&#39;s most powerful expressions,
											which is food.
											They&#39;re being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices

											Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.
											But before I get to that,
											I want to address something that you may be wondering about.
											The notion of fetal learning
											may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus —
											like playing Mozart through headphones
											placed on a pregnant belly.
											But actually, the nine-month-long process
											of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb
											is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.
											Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life —
											the air she breathes,
											the food and drink she consumes,
											the chemicals she&#39;s exposed to,
											even the emotions she feels —
											are shared in some fashion with her fetus.
											They make up a mix of influences
											as individual and idiosyncratic
											as the woman herself.
											The fetus incorporates these offerings
											into its own body,
											makes them part of its flesh and blood.
											And often it does something more.
											It treats these maternal contributions
											as information,
											as what I like to call biological postcards
											from the world outside.

									<p>
											So what a fetus is learning about in utero
											is not Mozart&#39;s &quot;Magic Flute&quot;
											but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.
											Will it be born into a world of abundance
											or scarcity?
											Will it be safe and protected,
											or will it face constant dangers and threats?
											Will it live a long, fruitful life
											or a short, harried one?
											The pregnant woman&#39;s diet and stress level in particular
											provide important clues to prevailing conditions
											like a finger lifted to the wind.
											The resulting tuning and tweaking
											of a fetus&#39; brain and other organs
											are part of what give us humans
											our enormous flexibility,
											our ability to thrive
											in a huge variety of environments,
											from the country to the city,
											from the tundra to the desert.

											To conclude, I want to tell you two stories
											about how mothers teach their children about the world
											even before they&#39;re born.
											In the autumn of 1944,
											the darkest days of World War II,
											German troops blockaded Western Holland,
											turning away all shipments of food.
											The opening of the Nazi&#39;s siege
											was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades —
											so cold the water in the canals froze solid.
											Soon food became scarce,
											with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day —
											a quarter of what they consumed before the war.
											As weeks of deprivation stretched into months,
											some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.
											By the beginning of May,
											the nation&#39;s carefully rationed food reserve
											was completely exhausted.
											The specter of mass starvation loomed.
											And then on May 5th, 1945,
											the siege came to a sudden end
											when Holland was liberated
											by the Allies.

									<p>
											The &quot;Hunger Winter,&quot; as it came to be known,
											killed some 10,000 people
											and weakened thousands more.
											But there was another population that was affected —
											the 40,000 fetuses
											in utero during the siege.
											Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy
											were immediately apparent
											in higher rates of stillbirths,
											birth defects, low birth weights
											and infant mortality.
											But others wouldn&#39;t be discovered for many years.
											Decades after the &quot;Hunger Winter,&quot;
											researchers documented
											that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege
											have more obesity, more diabetes
											and more heart disease in later life
											than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.
											These individuals&#39; prenatal experience of starvation
											seems to have changed their bodies
											in myriad ways.
											They have higher blood pressure,
											poorer cholesterol profiles
											and reduced glucose tolerance —
											a precursor of diabetes.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Why would undernutrition in the womb
											result in disease later?
											One explanation
											is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.
											When food is scarce,
											they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,
											and away from other organs
											like the heart and liver.
											This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,
											but the bill comes due later on in life
											when those other organs, deprived early on,
											become more susceptible to disease.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But that may not be all that&#39;s going on.
											It seems that fetuses are taking cues
											from the intrauterine environment
											and tailoring their physiology accordingly.
											They&#39;re preparing themselves
											for the kind of world they will encounter
											on the other side of the womb.
											The fetus adjusts its metabolism
											and other physiological processes
											in anticipation of the environment that awaits it.
											And the basis of the fetus&#39; prediction
											is what its mother eats.
											The meals a pregnant woman consumes
											constitute a kind of story,
											a fairy tale of abundance
											or a grim chronicle of deprivation.
											This story imparts information
											that the fetus uses
											to organize its body and its systems —
											an adaptation to prevailing circumstances
											that facilitates its future survival.
											Faced with severely limited resources,
											a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements
											will, in fact, have a better chance
											of living to adulthood.

											The real trouble comes
											when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,
											when fetuses are led
											to expect a world of scarcity
											and are born instead into a world of plenty.
											This is what happened to the children of the Dutch &quot;Hunger Winter.&quot;
											And their higher rates of obesity,
											diabetes and heart disease
											are the result.
											Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie
											found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories
											of the post-war Western diet.
											The world they had learned about while in utero
											was not the same
											as the world into which they were born.

											Here&#39;s another story.
											At 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001,
											there were tens of thousands of people
											in the vicinity of the World Trade Center
											in New York —
											commuters spilling off trains,
											waitresses setting tables for the morning rush,
											brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.
											1,700 of these people were pregnant women.
											When the planes struck and the towers collapsed,
											many of these women experienced the same horrors
											inflicted on other survivors of the disaster —
											the overwhelming chaos and confusion,
											the rolling clouds
											of potentially toxic dust and debris,
											the heart-pounding fear for their lives.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											About a year after 9/11,
											researchers examined a group of women
											who were pregnant
											when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.
											In the babies of those women
											who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD,
											following their ordeal,
											researchers discovered a biological marker
											of susceptibility to PTSD —
											an effect that was most pronounced
											in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe
											in their third trimester.
											In other words,
											the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome
											had passed on a vulnerability to the condition
											to their children while they were still in utero.

									<p>
											Now consider this:
											post-traumatic stress syndrome
											appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,
											causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.
											But there&#39;s another way of thinking about PTSD.
											What looks like pathology to us
											may actually be a useful adaptation
											in some circumstances.
											In a particularly dangerous environment,
											the characteristic manifestations of PTSD —
											a hyper-awareness of one&#39;s surroundings,
											a quick-trigger response to danger —
											could save someone&#39;s life.
											The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive
											is still speculative,
											but I find it rather poignant.
											It would mean that, even before birth,
											mothers are warning their children
											that it&#39;s a wild world out there,
											telling them, &quot;Be careful.&quot;

											Let me be clear.
											Fetal origins research is not about blaming women
											for what happens during pregnancy.
											It&#39;s about discovering how best to promote
											the health and well-being of the next generation.
											That important effort must include a focus
											on what fetuses learn
											during the nine months they spend in the womb.
											Learning is one of life&#39;s most essential activities,
											and it begins much earlier
