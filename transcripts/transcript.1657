											On the basis that a picture
is worth a thousand words,

											Melinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?
											This is in Africa, our very first trip,
											the first time either of us had ever been to Africa,
											in the fall of 1993.
											We were already engaged to be married.
											We married a few months later,
											and this was the trip where we really went to see
											the animals and to see the savanna.
											It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time
											off from work.
											But what really touched us, actually, were the people,
											and the extreme poverty.
											We started asking ourselves questions.
											Does it have to be like this?
											And at the end of the trip,
											we went out to Zanzibar,
											and took some time to walk on the beach,
											which is something we had done a lot
											while we were dating.
											And we&#39;d already been talking about during that time
											that the wealth that had come from Microsoft
											would be given back to society,
											but it was really on that beach walk
											that we started to talk about, well,
											what might we do and how might we go about it?

lots of countries in Africa,
											and I go in as a Western woman without a name.
											I don&#39;t tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.

about childhood vaccines,

getting called Depo-Provera,
											which is a contraceptive.
											And I would come back and
talk to global health experts,
											and they&#39;d say, &quot;Oh no, contraceptives
											are stocked in in the developing world.&quot;
											Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports,
											and this is what the team came to me with,

											that women tell you in Africa they want to use
											stocked out more than 200 days a year
											explains why women were saying to me,
											&quot;I walked 10 kilometers without
my husband knowing it,
											and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there.&quot;
											And so condoms were stocked in in Africa
											because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.

here in the United States,

women in the United States

											They bring down the dropout rate.

											But the thing that we learned from that work,

											MG: So we went to Tanzania.
											Jenn&#39;s been to Tanzania.
											All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.
											And we did something very different,
											which is, we decided to go spend
											two nights and three days with a family.
											Anna and Sanare are the parents.
											They invited us to come and stay in their boma.
											Actually, the goats had been there, I think,
											living in that particular little hut
											on their little compound before we got there.
											And we stayed with their family,
											and we really, really learned
											what life is like in rural Tanzania.
											And the difference between just going
											and visiting for half a day
											or three quarters of a day
											versus staying overnight was profound,
											and so let me just give you one explanation of that.
											They had six children, and as I talked to Anna
											in the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours
											in the cooking hut that day,
											and as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned
											and spaced with her husband
											the births of their children.
											It was a very loving relationship.
											This was a Maasai warrior and his wife,
											but they had decided to get married,
											they clearly had respect and love in the relationship.
											Their children, their six children,
											the two in the middle were twins, 13,
											a boy, and a girl named Grace.
											And when we&#39;d go out to chop wood
											and do all the things that Grace
and her mother would do,
											Grace was not a child, she was an adolescent,
											but she wasn&#39;t an adult.
											She was very, very shy.
											So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.
											We kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.
											And at night, though,
											when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania,
											and there was no moon that night,
											the first night, and no stars,
											and Jenn came out of our hut
											with her REI little headlamp on,
											Grace went immediately,
											and got the translator,
											came straight up to my Jenn and said,
											&quot;When you go home,
											can I have your headlamp
											so I can study at night?&quot;

French Gates is co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where she puts into practice the idea that every life has equal value.","whylisten":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>  works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives. As co-chair, Melinda French Gates helps shape and approve strategies, review results, advocate for foundation issues and set the overall direction. In developing countries, the foundation focuses on improving people&#39;s health with vaccines and other life-saving tools and giving them a chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to dramatically improve education so that all young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.</p><p>In recent years, Melinda French Gates has become a vocal advocate for access to contraception, advancing the idea that empowering women to decide whether and when to have children can have transformational effects on societies. In 2012, Gates spearheaded the London Summit on Family Planning, with the goal of delivering contraceptives to 120 million women in developing countries by 2020. When asked why she got involved in this issue, Gates said, &quot;We knew that 210 million women were saying they wanted access to the contraceptives we have here in the United States and we weren&#39;t providing them because of political controversy in our country. To me, that was just a crime. I kept looking around trying to find the person to get this back on the global stage. I realized I just had to do it.&quot;</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"339","slug":"bill_gates","is_published":true,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"Gates","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"Philanthropist","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/1d1b89d8a6ce5dfa5a8b8adc5486d0f97e066029_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"When Gates looks at the world, a world in which millions of preventable deaths occur each year, he sees an irrational, inefficient, broken system, an application that needs to be debugged. It shocks him -- his word -- that people don't see this, the same way it shocked him that nobody but he and [Paul] Allen saw the microchip for what it was.","whotheyare":"A passionate techie and a shrewd businessman, Bill Gates changed the world while leading Microsoft to dizzying success. Now he's doing it again with his own style of philanthropy and passion for innovation.","whylisten":"<p>Bill Gates is the founder and former CEO of Microsoft. A geek icon, tech visionary and business trailblazer, Gates&#39; leadership -- fueled by his long-held dream that <strong>millions might realize their potential through great software</strong> -- made Microsoft a personal computing powerhouse and a trendsetter in the Internet dawn. Whether you&#39;re a suit, chef, quant, artist, media maven, nurse or gamer, you&#39;ve probably used a Microsoft product today.<br /><br />In summer of 2008, Gates left his day-to-day role with Microsoft to focus on philanthropy. Holding that <strong>all lives have equal value (no matter where they&#39;re being lived)</strong>, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has now donated staggering sums to HIV/AIDS programs, libraries, agriculture research and disaster relief -- and offered vital guidance and creative funding to programs in global health and education. Gates believes his tech-centric strategy for giving will prove the killer app of planet Earth&#39;s next big upgrade. </p><p>Read a collection of Bill and Melinda Gates&#39; <a href=\"http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">annual letters</a>, where they take stock of the Gates Foundation and the world.
