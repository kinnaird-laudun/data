											In the last 50 years,
											we&#39;ve been building the suburbs
											with a lot of unintended consequences.
											And I&#39;m going to talk about some of those consequences
											and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects
											that I think give us tremendous reasons
											to be really optimistic
											that the big design and development project of the next 50 years
											is going to be retrofitting suburbia.
											So whether it&#39;s redeveloping dying malls
											or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores
											or reconstructing wetlands
											out of parking lots,
											I think the fact is
											the growing number
											of empty and under-performing,
											especially retail, sites
											throughout suburbia
											gives us actually a tremendous opportunity
											to take our least-sustainable
											landscapes right now
											and convert them into
											more sustainable places.
											And in the process, what that allows us to do
											is to redirect a lot more of our growth
											back into existing communities
											that could use a boost,
											and have the infrastructure in place,
											instead of continuing
											to tear down trees
											and to tear up the green space out at the edges.

									<p>
											So why is this important?
											I think there are any number of reasons,
											and I&#39;m just going to not get into detail but mention a few.
											Just from the perspective of climate change,
											the average urban dweller in the U.S.
											has about one-third the carbon footprint
											of the average suburban dweller,
											mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,
											and living in detached buildings,
											you have that much more exterior surface
											to leak energy out of.
											So strictly from
											a climate change perspective,
											the cities are already
											relatively green.
											The big opportunity
											to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
											is actually in urbanizing
											the suburbs.
											All that driving that we&#39;ve been doing out in the suburbs,
											we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.
											It&#39;s increased our dependence
											on foreign oil
											despite the gains in fuel efficiency.
											We&#39;re just driving so much more;
											we haven&#39;t been able to keep up technologically.

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Public health is another reason
											to consider retrofitting.
											Researchers at the CDC and other places
											have increasingly been linking
											suburban development patterns
											with sedentary lifestyles.
											And those have been linked then
											with the rather alarming,
											growing rates of obesity,
											shown in these maps here,
											and that obesity has also been triggering
											great increases in heart disease
											and diabetes
											to the point where a child born today
											has a one-in-three chance
											of developing diabetes.
											And that rate has been escalating at the same rate
											as children not walking
											to school anymore,
											again, because of our development patterns.

									<p>
											And then there&#39;s finally — there&#39;s the affordability question.
											I mean, how affordable is it
											to continue to live in suburbia
											with rising gas prices?
											Suburban expansion to cheap land,
											for the last 50 years —
											you know the cheap land out on the edge —
											has helped generations of families
											enjoy the American dream.
											But increasingly,
											the savings promised
											by drive-till-you-qualify affordability —
											which is basically our model —
											those savings are wiped out
											when you consider the transportation costs.
											For instance, here in Atlanta,
											about half of households
											make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,
											and they are spending 29 percent of their income
											on housing
											and 32 percent
											on transportation.
											I mean, that&#39;s 2005 figures.
											That&#39;s before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.
											You know, none of us
											really tend to do the math on our transportation costs,
											and they&#39;re not going down
											any time soon.

											Whether you love suburbia&#39;s leafy privacy
											or you hate its soulless commercial strips,
											there are reasons why it&#39;s important to retrofit.
											But is it practical?
											I think it is.
											June Williamson and I have been researching this topic
											for over a decade,
											and we&#39;ve found over 80
											varied projects.
											But that they&#39;re really all market driven,
											and what&#39;s driving the market in particular —
											number one — is major demographic shifts.
											We all tend to think of suburbia
											as this very family-focused place,
											but that&#39;s really not the case anymore.
											Since 2000,
											already two-thirds of households in suburbia
											did not have kids in them.
											We just haven&#39;t caught up with the actual realities of this.
											The reasons for this have a lot to with
											the dominance of the two big
											demographic groups right now:
											the Baby Boomers retiring —
											and then there&#39;s a gap,
											Generation X, which is a small generation.
											They&#39;re still having kids —
											but Generation Y hasn&#39;t even started
											hitting child-rearing age.
											They&#39;re the other big generation.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So as a result of that,
											demographers predict
											that through 2025,
											75 to 85 percent of new households
											will not have kids in them.
											And the market research, consumer research,
											asking the Boomers and Gen Y
											what it is they would like,
											what they would like to live in,
											tells us there is going to be a huge demand —
											and we&#39;re already seeing it —
											for more urban lifestyles
											within suburbia.
											That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place,
											and Gen Y would like to live
											an urban lifestyle,
											but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.

											The other big dynamic of change
											is the sheer performance of
											underperforming asphalt.
											Now I keep thinking this would be a great name
											for an indie rock band,
											but developers generally use it
											to refer to underused parking lots —
											and suburbia is full of them.
											When the postwar suburbs were first built
											out on the cheap land
											away from downtown,
											it made sense to just build
											surface parking lots.
											But those sites have now been leapfrogged
											and leapfrogged again,
											as we&#39;ve just continued to sprawl,
											and they now have
											a relatively central location.
											It no longer just makes sense.
											That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.
											It now makes sense to go back in,
											build a deck and build up
											on those sites.
											So what do you do
											with a dead mall,
											dead office park?
											It turns out, all sorts of things.
											In a slow economy like ours,
											re-inhabitation is
											one of the more popular strategies.

											So this happens to be
											a dead mall in St. Louis
											that&#39;s been re-inhabited as art-space.
											It&#39;s now home to artist studios,
											theater groups, dance troupes.
											It&#39;s not pulling in as much tax revenue
											as it once was,
											but it&#39;s serving its community.
											It&#39;s keeping the lights on.
											It&#39;s becoming, I think, a really great institution.
											Other malls have been re-inhabited
											as nursing homes,
											as universities,
											and as all variety of office space.
											We also found a lot of examples
											of dead big-box stores
											that have been converted into
											all sorts of community-serving uses as well —
											lots of schools, lots of churches
											and lots of libraries like this one.

											This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store,
											that is now a public library.
											In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse,
											they tore up some of the parking spaces,
											put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff,
											put in a lot more sidewalks
											to connect to the neighborhoods.
											And they&#39;ve made this,
											what was just a store along a commercial strip,
											into a community gathering space.
											This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center
											in Phoenix, Arizona.
											Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,
											a gourmet grocery,
											and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.
											Never underestimate the power of food
											to turn a place around
											and make it a destination.
											It&#39;s been so successful, they&#39;ve now taken over the strip across the street.
											The real estate ads in the neighborhood
											all very proudly proclaim,
											&quot;Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,&quot;
											because it provided its neighborhood
											with what sociologists like to call
											&quot;a third place.&quot;
											If home is the first place
											and work is the second place,
											the third place is where you go to hang out
											and build community.
											And especially as suburbia is becoming
											less centered on the family,
											the family households,
											there&#39;s a real hunger
											for more third places.

											So the most dramatic retrofits
											are really those in the next category,
											the next strategy: redevelopment.
											Now, during the boom, there were several
											really dramatic redevelopment projects
											where the original building
											was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt
											at significantly greater density,
											a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.
											But some of them have been much more incremental.
											This is Mashpee Commons,
											the oldest retrofit that we&#39;ve found.
											And it&#39;s just incrementally, over the last 20 years,
											built urbanism
											on top of its parking lots.
											So the black and white photo shows
											the simple 60&#39;s strip shopping center.
											And then the maps above that
											show its gradual transformation
											into a compact,
											mixed-use New England village,
											and it has plans now that have been approved
											for it to connect
											to new residential neighborhoods
											across the arterials
											and over to the other side.
											So, you know, sometimes it&#39;s incremental.
											Sometimes, it&#39;s all at once.

											This is another infill project on the parking lots,
											this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
											When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs
											and opened a station nearby to this site,
											the owners decided
											to build a new parking deck
											and then insert on top of their surface lots
											a new Main Street, several apartments
											and condo buildings,
											while keeping the existing office buildings.
											Here is the site in 1940:
											It was just a little farm
											in the village of Hyattsville.
											By 1980, it had been subdivided
											into a big mall on one side
											and the office park on the other
											and then some buffer sites for a library
											and a church to the far right.
											Today, the transit,
											the Main Street and the new housing
											have all been built.
											Eventually, I expect that the streets
											will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.
											Plans have already been announced
											for a lot of those garden apartments
											above the mall to be redeveloped.
											Transit is a big driver of retrofits.
											So here&#39;s what it looks like.
											You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings
											in between the office buildings
											and the public space and the new Main Street.

											This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.
											I think they really built an attractive place here
											and have just employed all-green construction.
											There&#39;s massive P.V. arrays on the roofs
											as well as wind turbines.
											This was a very large mall
											on a hundred-acre superblock.
											It&#39;s now 22
											walkable urban blocks
											with public streets,
											two public parks, eight bus lines
											and a range of housing types,
											and so it&#39;s really given Lakewood, Colorado
											the downtown
											that this particular suburb never had.
											Here was the mall in its heyday.
											They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.
											So here&#39;s the site in 1975
											with the mall.
											By 1995, the mall has died.
											The department store has been kept —
											and we found this was true in many cases.
											The department stores are multistory; they&#39;re better built.
											They&#39;re easy to be re-adapted.
											But the one story stuff ...
											that&#39;s really history.

											So here it is at projected build-out.
											This project, I think, has great connectivity
											to the existing neighborhoods.
											It&#39;s providing 1,500 households with the option
											of a more urban lifestyle.
											It&#39;s about two-thirds built out right now.
											Here&#39;s what the new Main Street looks like.
											It&#39;s very successful,
											and it&#39;s helped to prompt —
											eight of the 13
											regional malls in Denver
											have now, or have announced plans to
											be, retrofitted.
											But it&#39;s important to note that all of this retrofitting
											is not occurring —
											just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.
											No, it&#39;s pockets of walkability
											on the sites of
											under-performing properties.
											And so it&#39;s giving people more choices,
											but it&#39;s not taking away choices.

									<p>
											But it&#39;s also not really enough
											to just create pockets of walkability.
											You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.
											We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.
											So this is one that has been
											retrofitted in California.
											They took the commercial strip
											shown on the black-and-white images below,
											and they built a boulevard
											that has become the Main Street for their town.
											And it&#39;s transformed from being
											an ugly, unsafe,
											undesirable address,
											to becoming a beautiful,
											attractive, dignified sort of good address.
											I mean now we&#39;re hoping we start to see it;
											they&#39;ve already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.
											I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there
											without tearing down another tree.
											So there&#39;s a lot of great things,
											but I&#39;d love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.

											But densification
											is not going to work everywhere.
											Sometimes re-greening
											is really the better answer.
											There&#39;s a lot to learn from successful
											landbanking programs
											in cities like Flint, Michigan.
											There&#39;s also a burgeoning suburban farming movement —
											sort of victory gardens meets the Internet.
											But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects
											is the opportunity to restore
											the local ecology,
											as in this example outside of Minneapolis.
											When the shopping center died,
											the city restored the site&#39;s
											original wetlands,
											creating lakefront property,
											which then attracted private investment,
											the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood
											in over 40 years.
											So they&#39;ve managed to both restore the local ecology
											and the local economy at the same time.
											This is another re-greening example.
											It also makes sense in very strong markets.
											This one in Seattle
											is on the site of a mall parking lot
											adjacent to a new transit stop.
											And the wavy line
											is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.
											The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.
											But daylighting our creeks
											really improves their water quality
											and contributions to habitat.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I&#39;ve shown you some of
											the first generation of retrofits.
											What&#39;s next?
											I think we have three challenges for the future.
											The first is to plan retrofitting
											much more systemically
											at the metropolitan scale.
											We need to be able to target
											which areas really should be re-greened.
											Where should we be redeveloping?
											And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?
											These slides just show two images
											from a larger project
											that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.
											I led a team that was asked to imagine
											Atlanta 100 years from now.
											And we chose to try to reverse sprawl
											through three simple moves — expensive, but simple.
											One, in a hundred years,
											transit on all major
											rail and road corridors.
											Two, in a hundred years,
											thousand foot buffers
											on all stream corridors.
											It&#39;s a little extreme, but we&#39;ve got a little water problem.
											In a hundred years,
											subdivisions that simply end up too close to water
											or too far from transit won&#39;t be viable.
											And so we&#39;ve created the eco-acre
											transfer-to-transfer development rights
											to the transit corridors
											and allow the re-greening
											of those former subdivisions
											for food and energy production.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the second challenge
											is to improve the architectural design quality
											of the retrofits.
											And I close with this image
											of democracy in action:
											This is a protest that&#39;s happening
											on a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland
											on an Astroturf town green.
											Now, retrofits are often accused
											of being examples of faux downtowns
											and instant urbanism,
											and not without reason; you don&#39;t get much more phony
											than an Astroturf town green.
											I have to say, these are very hybrid places.
											They are new but trying to look old.
											They have urban streetscapes,
											but suburban parking ratios.
											Their populations are
											more diverse than typical suburbia,
											but they&#39;re less diverse than cities.
											And they are
											public places,
											but that are managed by private companies.
											And just the surface appearance
											are often — like the Astroturf here —
											they make me wince.
											So, you know, I mean I&#39;m glad that
											the urbanism is doing its job.
											The fact that a protest is happening
											really does mean
											that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space,
											compromised as it may be,
											is still a really great thing.
											But we&#39;ve got to get the architecture better.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The final challenge is for all of you.
											I want you to join the protest
											and start demanding
											more sustainable suburban places —
											more sustainable places, period.
											But culturally,
											we tend to think that downtowns
											should be dynamic, and we expect that.
											But we seem to have an expectation
											that the suburbs should forever remain frozen
											in whatever adolescent form
											they were first given birth to.
											It&#39;s time to let them grow up,
											so I want you
											to all support the zoning changes,
											the road diets, the infrastructure improvements
											and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you.
