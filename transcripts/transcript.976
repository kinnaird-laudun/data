<title>Niall Ferguson: The 6 killer apps of prosperity | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Over the past few centuries, Western cultures have been very good at creating general prosperity for themselves. Historian Niall Ferguson asks: Why the West, and less so the rest? He suggests half a dozen big ideas from Western culture -- call them the 6 killer apps -- that promote wealth, stability and innovation. And in this new century, he says, these apps are all shareable." />

<meta content='Over the past few centuries, Western cultures have been very good at creating general prosperity for themselves. Historian Niall Ferguson asks: Why the West, and less so the rest? He suggests half a dozen big ideas from Western culture — call them the 6 killer apps — that promote wealth, stability and innovation. And in this new century, he says, these apps are all shareable.' itemprop='description'>

											Let&#39;s talk about billions.

											have ever lived.
											And we know that most of them are dead.
											And we also know
											that most of them live or lived in Asia.
											And we also know
											that most of them were or are very poor —
											did not live for very long.
											Let&#39;s talk about billions.
											Let&#39;s talk about
											the 195,000 billion dollars of wealth
											in the world today.
											We know that most of that wealth
											was made after the year 1800.
											And we know that most of it
											is currently owned
											by people we might call Westerners:
											Europeans, North Americans, Australasians.
											19 percent of the world&#39;s population today,
											Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth.

											Economic historians
											call this &quot;The Great Divergence.&quot;
											And this slide here
											is the best simplification
											of the Great Divergence story
											I can offer you.
											It&#39;s basically two ratios
											of per capita GDP,
											per capita gross domestic product,
											so average income.
											One, the red line,
											is the ratio of British to Indian
											per capita income.
											And the blue line
											is the ratio of American to Chinese.
											And this chart goes back to 1500.
											And you can see here
											that there&#39;s an exponential Great Divergence.
											They start off pretty close together.
											In fact, in 1500,
											the average Chinese was richer than the average North American.
											When you get to the 1970s,
											which is where this chart ends,
											the average Briton is more than 10 times richer
											than the average Indian.
											And that&#39;s allowing
											for differences in the cost of living.
											It&#39;s based on purchasing power parity.
											The average American
											is nearly 20 times richer
											than the average Chinese
											by the 1970s.

											So why?
											This wasn&#39;t just an economic story.
											If you take the 10 countries
											that went on to become
											the Western empires,
											in 1500 they were really quite tiny —
											five percent of the world&#39;s land surface,
											16 percent of its population,
											maybe 20 percent of its income.
											By 1913,
											these 10 countries, plus the United States,
											controlled vast global empires —
											58 percent of the world&#39;s territory,
											about the same percentage of its population,
											and a really huge, nearly three-quarters share
											of global economic output.
											And notice, most of that went to the motherland,
											to the imperial metropoles,
											not to their colonial possessions.

									<p>
											Now you can&#39;t just blame this on imperialism —
											though many people have tried to do so —
											for two reasons.
											One, empire was the least original thing
											that the West did after 1500.
											Everybody did empire.
											They beat preexisting Oriental empires
											like the Mughals and the Ottomans.
											So it really doesn&#39;t look like empire is a great explanation
											for the Great Divergence.
											In any case, as you may remember,
											the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s,
											some considerable time after decolonization.
											This is not a new question.

											That&#39;s a great question.

											an Ottoman official,

											&quot;Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past

											begin to dominate so many lands in modern times
											and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?&quot;
											Unlike Rasselas,

											You may think we can explain the Great Divergence
											in terms of geography.
											We know that&#39;s wrong,
											because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century
											to see if geography mattered more than institutions.
											We took all the Germans,
											we divided them roughly in two,
											and we gave the ones in the East communism,
											and you see the result.
											Within an incredibly short period of time,
											people living in the German Democratic Republic
											produced Trabants, the Trabbi,
											one of the world&#39;s worst ever cars,
											while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.
											If you still don&#39;t believe me,
											we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.
											And we decided we&#39;d take Koreans
											in roughly the same geographical place
											with, notice, the same basic traditional culture,
											and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.
											And the result is an even bigger divergence
											in a very short space of time
											than happened in Germany.
											Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly,
											but in almost every other respect,
											it&#39;s a huge divergence.
											Which leads me to think
											that neither geography nor national character,
											popular explanations for this kind of thing,
											are really significant.

											Let&#39;s call them the killer apps.

											that set the West apart from the rest.
											And they&#39;re kind of like the apps on your phone,

											They&#39;re just icons; you click on them.

											There are six
											which I think explain the Great Divergence.
											One, competition.
											Two, the scientific revolution.
											Three, property rights.
											Four, modern medicine.
											Five, the consumer society.
											And six, the work ethic.

											Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this,
											synthesizing the work of many economic historians
											in the process.
											Competition means,
											not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500,
											but within each of these units,
											there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.
											The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation,
											existed in the 12th century.
											Nothing like this existed in China,
											where there was one monolithic state
											covering a fifth of humanity,
											and anyone with any ambition
											had to pass one standardized examination,
											which took three days and was very difficult
											and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters
											and very complex Confucian essay writing.

									<p>
											The scientific revolution was different
											from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world
											in a number of crucial ways,
											the most important being
											that, through the experimental method,
											it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.
											Example: Benjamin Robins&#39;s extraordinary application
											of Newtonian physics to ballistics.
											Once you do that,
											your artillery becomes accurate.
											Think of what that means.
											That really was a killer application.
											(Laughter)
											Meanwhile, there&#39;s no scientific revolution anywhere else.
											The Ottoman Empire&#39;s not that far from Europe,
											but there&#39;s no scientific revolution there.
											In fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din&#39;s observatory,
											because it&#39;s considered blasphemous
											to inquire into the mind of God.

											Property rights: It&#39;s not the democracy, folks;
											it&#39;s having the rule of law based on private property rights.
											That&#39;s what makes the difference
											between North America and South America.
											You could turn up in North America
											having signed a deed of indenture
											saying, &quot;I&#39;ll work for nothing for five years.
											You just have to feed me.&quot;
											But at the end of it, you&#39;ve got a hundred acres of land.
											That&#39;s the land grant
											on the bottom half of the slide.
											That&#39;s not possible in Latin America
											where land is held onto
											by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors.
											And you can see here the huge divergence
											that happens in property ownership between North and South.
											Most people in rural North America
											owned some land by 1900.
											Hardly anyone in South America did.
											That&#39;s another killer app.

											Modern medicine in the late 19th century
											began to make major breakthroughs
											against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.
											And this was another killer app —
											the very opposite of a killer,
											because it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy.
											It even did that
											in the European empires.
											Even in places like Senegal,
											beginning in the early 20th century,
											there were major breakthroughs in public health,

											The consumer society is what you need

											That&#39;s the consumer society,

											Japan was the first non-Western society

											Finally, the work ethic.
											Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.

											Any culture can get the work ethic
											if the institutions are there
											to create the incentive to work.
											We know this
											because today the work ethic
											is no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon.
											In fact, the West has lost its work ethic.
											Today, the average Korean
											works a thousand hours more a year
											than the average German —
											a thousand.
											And this is part
											of a really extraordinary phenomenon,

											is the Shanghai district of China.
											The gap between Shanghai
											and the United Kingdom and the United States
											is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.

											You probably assume
											that because the iPhone was designed in California
											but assembled in China
											that the West still leads in terms of technological innovation.
											You&#39;re wrong.
											In terms of patents,
											there&#39;s no question that the East is ahead.
											Not only has Japan been ahead for some time,
											South Korea has gone into third place,
											and China is just about to overtake Germany.
											Why?
											Because the killer apps can be downloaded.
											It&#39;s open source.
											Any society can adopt these institutions,
											and when they do,
											they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 —
											only faster.

											So I want to end with three questions
											for the future billions,
											just ahead of 2016,
											when the United States will lose its place
											as number one economy to China.
											The first is, can you delete these apps,
											and are we in the process of doing so
											in the Western world?
											The second question is,
											does the sequencing of the download matter?
											And could Africa get that sequencing wrong?
											One obvious implication of modern economic history
											is that it&#39;s quite hard to transition to democracy
											before you&#39;ve established
											secure private property rights.
											Warning: that may not work.
											And third, can China do without
											killer app number three?
											That&#39;s the one that John Locke systematized
											when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights
											and the protection of law.
											That&#39;s the basis
											for the Western model
											of representative government.
											Now this picture shows the demolition
											of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei&#39;s studio
											in Shanghai earlier this year.
											He&#39;s now free again,
											having been detained, as you know, for some time.
											But I don&#39;t think his studio has been rebuilt.

											Winston Churchill once defined civilization
											in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938.
											And I think these words really nail it:
											&quot;It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians.
											It means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs,
											the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny,
											give place to parliaments where laws are made,
											and independent courts of justice
											in which over long periods those laws are maintained.
											That is civilization —
											and in its soil grow continually
											freedom, comfort and culture,&quot;
											what all TEDsters care about most.
											&quot;When civilization reigns in any country,
											a wider and less harassed life
											is afforded to the masses of the people.&quot;

											I don&#39;t think the decline of Western civilization
											is inevitable,
											because I don&#39;t think history operates
											in this kind of life-cycle model,
											beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole&#39;s
											&quot;Course of Empire&quot; paintings.
											That&#39;s not the way history works.
											That&#39;s not the way the West rose,
											and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the way the West will fall.
											The West may collapse very suddenly.
											Complex civilizations do that,
											because they operate, most of the time,
											on the edge of chaos.
											That&#39;s one of the most profound insights
											to come out of the historical study of complex institutions
											like civilizations.
											No, we may hang on,
											despite the huge burdens of debt that we&#39;ve accumulated,
											despite the evidence that we&#39;ve lost our work ethic
											and other parts of our historical mojo.

His books chronicle a wide range of political and socio-economic events; he has written about everything from German politics during the era of inflation to a financial history of the world. He&rsquo;s now working on a biography of former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. <br /><br />Ferguson is a prolific and often controversial commentator on contemporary politics and economics. He frequently writes, reviews, and hosts for the British and American press. His latest book and TV series, Civilization: The West and the Rest, aims to help 21st-century audiences understand the past and the present. In it, he asks how, since the 1500s, Western nations have surpassed their Eastern counterparts and came to dominate the world (his answer: thanks to six &ldquo;killer apps&rdquo;: science, medicine, protestant work ethic, competition, property rights, consumer society). And he wonders whether that domination is now threatened by the rise of Asia. His theories have drawn criticism and prompted discussions, which he says was his intent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s designed to be slightly annoying, so that you talk about it,&rdquo; he told The Observer. </p><p>He says: &quot;If a majority of people subscribe to a particular view, it pays to question it.
