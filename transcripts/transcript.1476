<title>Peter Attia: Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As a young surgeon, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war." />

<meta content='As a young surgeon, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.' itemprop='description'>

									<p>
											I&#39;ll never forget that day
											back in the spring of 2006.
											I was a surgical resident
											at The Johns Hopkins Hospital,
											taking emergency call.
											I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning
											to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer
											on her foot.
											I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh
											as I pulled the curtain back to see her.
											And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick
											and she needed to be in the hospital.
											That wasn&#39;t being asked.
											The question that was being asked of me was a different one,
											which was, did she also need an amputation?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, looking back on that night,
											I&#39;d love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman
											on that night with the same empathy and compassion
											I&#39;d shown the 27-year-old newlywed
											who came to the E.R. three nights earlier
											with lower back pain
											that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.
											In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do
											that was actually going to save her life.
											The cancer was too advanced.
											But I was committed to making sure that
											I could do anything possible to make her stay
											more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket
											and a cup of a coffee.
											I brought some for her parents.
											But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her,
											because obviously she had done nothing
											to bring this on herself.
											So why was it that, just a few nights later,
											as I stood in that same E.R. and determined
											that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation,
											why did I hold her in such bitter contempt?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											You see, unlike the woman the night before,
											this woman had type 2 diabetes.
											She was fat.
											And we all know that&#39;s from eating too much
											and not exercising enough, right?
											I mean, how hard can it be?
											As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself,
											if you just tried caring even a little bit,
											you wouldn&#39;t be in this situation at this moment
											with some doctor you&#39;ve never met
											about to amputate your foot.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Why did I feel justified in judging her?
											I&#39;d like to say I don&#39;t know.
											But I actually do.
											You see, in the hubris of my youth,

											You can think of insulin as this master hormone
											that controls what our body does with the foods we eat,
											whether we burn it or store it.
											This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.
											Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.
											And insulin resistance, as its name suggests,
											is when your cells get increasingly resistant
											to the effect of insulin trying to do its job.
											Once you&#39;re insulin-resistant,
											you&#39;re on your way to getting diabetes,
											which is what happens when your pancreas
											can&#39;t keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.
											Now your blood sugar levels start to rise,
											and an entire cascade of pathologic events
											sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease,
											cancer, even Alzheimer&#39;s disease,
											and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.

											Now, most researchers believe obesity

											Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance,

											You treat the obesity.
											But what if we have it backwards?
											What if obesity isn&#39;t the cause of insulin resistance at all?
											In fact, what if it&#39;s a symptom of a much deeper problem,
											the tip of a proverbial iceberg?
											I know it sounds crazy because we&#39;re obviously in the midst
											of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.
											What if obesity is a coping mechanism
											for a far more sinister problem going on
											underneath the cell?
											I&#39;m not suggesting that obesity is benign,

											of two metabolic evils.

											You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity
											of our cells to partition fuel,
											as I alluded to a moment ago,
											taking those calories that we take in
											and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.
											When we become insulin-resistant,
											the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.
											So now, when insulin says to a cell,
											I want you to burn more energy
											than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says,
											&quot;No thanks, I&#39;d actually rather store this energy.&quot;
											And because fat cells are actually missing most of
											the complex cellular machinery found in other cells,
											it&#39;s probably the safest place to store it.
											So for many of us, about 75 million Americans,
											the appropriate response to insulin resistance
											may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse,
											getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.

											This is a really subtle distinction,
											but the implication could be profound.
											Consider the following analogy:
											Think of the bruise you get on your shin
											when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.
											Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly
											don&#39;t like the discolored look, but we all know
											the bruise per Se is not the problem.
											In fact, it&#39;s the opposite. It&#39;s a healthy response to the trauma,
											all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury
											to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread
											of infection to elsewhere in the body.
											Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem,
											and we evolved a giant medical establishment
											and a culture around treating bruises:
											masking creams, painkillers, you name it,
											all the while ignoring the fact that people
											are still banging their shins into coffee tables.
											How much better would we be if we treated the cause —
											telling people to pay attention
											when they walk through the living room —
											rather than the effect?
											Getting the cause and the effect right
											makes all the difference in the world.
											Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry
											can still do very well for its shareholders
											but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.

											So what I&#39;m suggesting is

											on obesity and insulin resistance.
											Maybe we should be asking ourselves,
											is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain
											and the diseases associated with obesity,
											at least in most people?
											What if being obese is just a metabolic response

											an underlying epidemic,

											Let&#39;s look at some suggestive facts.
											We know that 30 million obese Americans
											in the United States don&#39;t have insulin resistance.
											And by the way, they don&#39;t appear to be at any
											greater risk of disease than lean people.
											Conversely, we know that six million lean people
											in the United States are insulin-resistant,
											and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk
											for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago
											than their obese counterparts.
											Now I don&#39;t know why, but it might be because,
											in their case, their cells haven&#39;t actually figured out
											the right thing to do with that excess energy.
											So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance,
											and you can be lean and have it,
											this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy
											for what&#39;s going on.

											Personally, I can&#39;t afford the luxury of arrogance anymore,
											let alone the luxury of certainty.
											I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this,
											but I&#39;m wide open to others.
											Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me,
											is this.
											If you ask yourself, what&#39;s a cell trying to protect itself from
											when it becomes insulin resistant,
											the answer probably isn&#39;t too much food.
											It&#39;s more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.
											Now, we know that refined grains and starches
											elevate your blood sugar in the short run,
											and there&#39;s even reason to believe that sugar
											may lead to insulin resistance directly.
											So if you put these physiological processes to work,
											I&#39;d hypothesize that it might be our increased intake
											of refined grains, sugars and starches that&#39;s driving
											this epidemic of obesity and diabetes,
											but through insulin resistance,

											When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago,

											For the past year, I&#39;ve been fortunate enough

											We&#39;ve recruited a team of scientific rivals,

											do agree on two things.
											First, this problem is just simply too important

											And two, if we&#39;re willing to be wrong,
											if we&#39;re willing to challenge the conventional wisdom

											Briefly, to address this, our research program
											is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.
											First, how do the various foods we consume
											impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes,
											and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?
											Second, based on these insights,
											can people make the necessary changes in their diets
											in a way that&#39;s safe and practical to implement?
											And finally, once we identify what safe
											and practical changes people can make to their diet,
											how can we move their behavior in that direction
											so that it becomes more the default
											rather than the exception?
											Just because you know what to do doesn&#39;t mean
											you&#39;re always going to do it.
											Sometimes we have to put cues around people
											to make it easier, and believe it or not,
											that can be studied scientifically.

											I don&#39;t know how this journey is going to end,
											but this much seems clear to me, at least:
											We can&#39;t keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients
											like I did.
											Most of them actually want to do the right thing,
											but they have to know what that is,
											and it&#39;s got to work.
											I dream of a day when our patients can
											shed their excess pounds
											and cure themselves of insulin resistance,
											because as medical professionals,
											we&#39;ve shed our excess mental baggage
											and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently
											to go back to our original ideals:
											open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday&#39;s ideas
											when they don&#39;t appear to be working,
											and the understanding that scientific truth isn&#39;t final,
											but constantly evolving.
											Staying true to that path will be better for our patients
											and better for science.
											If obesity is nothing more than a proxy

a surgeon and a self-experimenter, Peter Attia hopes to ease the diabetes epidemic by challenging what we think we know and improving the scientific rigor in nutrition and obesity research. ","whylisten":"<p class=\"p1\">Peter Attia has dedicated his medical career to investigating the relationship between nutrition, obesity and diabetes. A surgeon who developed metabolic syndrome himself despite the fact that he ate well and exercised often, Attia realized that our understanding of these important health issues may not actually be correct. From 2012-2015, he devoted himself to using vigorous scientific inquiry to test both our assumptions and new hypotheses through the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nusi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrition Science Initiative</a>, the nonprofit he co-founded with journalist Gary Taubes. Now in private practice, Attia writes the blog&nbsp;<a href=\"http://eatingacademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eating Academy</a>, which charts his own adventures in nutrition and examines scientific evidence surrounding food, weight loss and disease risk. Overall, he hopes to convince others that sharp increases in the rates of obesity and diabetes -- despite the fact that we are more culturally aware of these problems than ever -- might be a result of people being given the wrong information.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Attia came to this calling through an unusual path. While he was studying mechanical engineering as an undergrad, a personal experience led him to discover his passion for medicine. He enrolled at Stanford Medical School, and went on to a residency in general surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital and a post-doctoral fellowship at the National Cancer Institute. After his residency, he joined the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company, where he worked on healthcare and financial system problems. The most valuable skill he learned along the way: to ask bold questions about medical assumptions.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Peter Attia","tags":["health","health care","medical research","medicine","obesity","public health"],"title":"Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem?","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2634772}]}
