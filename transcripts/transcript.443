											So after being at MIT for a few years,
											I realized that writing academic papers
is not that exciting.
											You know, I don&#39;t know
how many of those you read,
											but it&#39;s not fun to read
and often not fun to write —
											even worse to write.
											So I decided to try and write
something more fun.
											And I came up with an idea
that I would write a cookbook.
											And the title for my cookbook
was going to be,
											&quot;Dining Without Crumbs:
The Art of Eating Over the Sink.&quot;

											I will tell you a little bit
about irrational behavior,
											and I want to start by giving you
some examples of visual illusion
											as a metaphor for rationality.
											So think about these two tables.
											And you must have seen this illusion.
											If I asked you what&#39;s longer, the vertical
line on the table on the left,
											or the horizontal line
on the table on the right,
											which one seems longer?
											Can anybody see anything
but the left one being longer?
											No, right? It&#39;s impossible.
											But the nice thing about visual illusion
is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.
											So I can put some lines
on; it doesn&#39;t help.
											I can animate the lines.
											And to the extent you believe
I didn&#39;t shrink the lines,
											which I didn&#39;t, I&#39;ve proven to you
that your eyes were deceiving you.
											Now, the interesting thing about this

											So I want to show you
some cognitive illusions,
											or decision-making illusions,
in the same way.
											And this is one of my favorite
plots in social sciences.
											It&#39;s from a paper
by Johnson and Goldstein.
											It basically shows the percentage
of people who indicated
											they would be interested
in donating their organs.
											These are different countries in Europe.
											You basically see two types of countries:
											countries on the right,
that seem to be giving a lot;
											and countries on the left
that seem to giving very little,
											or much less.
											The question is, why?
											Why do some countries give a lot
and some countries give a little?

											When you ask people this question,
											they usually think that it has
to be about culture.
											How much do you care about people?
											Giving organs to somebody else
											is probably about how much you care
about society, how linked you are.
											Or maybe it&#39;s about religion.
											But if you look at this plot,
											you can see that countries
that we think about as very similar,
											actually exhibit very different behavior.
											For example, Sweden
is all the way on the right,
											and Denmark, which we think
is culturally very similar,
											is all the way on the left.
											Germany is on the left,
and Austria is on the right.
											The Netherlands is on the left,
and Belgium is on the right.
											And finally, depending
on your particular version
											of European similarity,
											you can think about the U.K. and France
as either similar culturally or not,
											but it turns out that with organ
donation, they are very different.

											By the way, the Netherlands
is an interesting story.
											You see, the Netherlands is kind
of the biggest of the small group.
											It turns out that they got to 28 percent
											after mailing every household
in the country a letter,
											begging people to join
this organ donation program.
											You know the expression,
&quot;Begging only gets you so far.&quot;
											It&#39;s 28 percent in organ donation.

											But whatever the countries
on the right are doing,
											they&#39;re doing a much
better job than begging.
											So what are they doing?
											Turns out the secret has to do
with a form at the DMV.
											And here is the story.
											The countries on the left
have a form at the DMV
											that looks something like this.
											&quot;Check the box below if you want to
participate in the organ donor program.&quot;
											And what happens?
											People don&#39;t check, and they don&#39;t join.
											The countries on the right,
the ones that give a lot,
											have a slightly different form.
											It says, &quot;Check the box below
if you don&#39;t want to participate ...&quot;
											Interestingly enough,
when people get this,
											they again don&#39;t check, but now they join.

											we open the refrigerator and we feel

											What this is actually saying,
											is that many of these decisions
are not residing within us.
											They are residing in the person

your license tomorrow,

											and you encountered one of these forms,
											that it would actually
change your own behavior?
											Very hard to think
that it would influence us.
											We can say, &quot;Oh, these funny Europeans,
of course it would influence them.&quot;
											But when it comes to us,
											we have such a feeling
that we&#39;re in the driver&#39;s seat,
											such a feeling that we&#39;re in control
and we are making the decision,
											that it&#39;s very hard

											Now in some ways,

											The moment you add Rome without coffee,
											Rome with coffee becomes more popular,

											The fact that you have Rome without coffee

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Here are two examples of this principle.
											This was an ad in The Economist
a few years ago
											that gave us three choices:
											an online subscription for 59 dollars,
											a print subscription for 125 dollars,
											or you could get both for 125.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now I looked at this,
and I called up The Economist,
											and I tried to figure out
what they were thinking.
											And they passed me from one person
to another to another,
											until eventually I got to the person
who was in charge of the website,
											and I called them up, and they went
to check what was going on.
											The next thing I know,
the ad is gone, no explanation.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I decided to do the experiment
											that I would have loved
The Economist to do with me.
											I took this and I gave it
to 100 MIT students.
											I said, &quot;What would you choose?&quot;
											These are the market shares —
most people wanted the combo deal.
											Thankfully, nobody wanted
the dominant option.
											That means our students can read.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But now, if you have an option
that nobody wants,
											you can take it off, right?
											So I printed another version of this,
											where I eliminated the middle option.
											I gave it to another 100 students.
Here is what happened:
											Now the most popular option
became the least popular,
											and the least popular
became the most popular.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What was happening
was the option that was useless,
											in the middle, was useless
in the sense that nobody wanted it.
											But it wasn&#39;t useless in the sense
that it helped people figure out
											what they wanted.
											In fact, relative
to the option in the middle,
											which was get only the print for 125,
											the print and web for 125
looked like a fantastic deal.
											And as a consequence, people chose it.
											The general idea here, by the way,
											is that we actually don&#39;t know
our preferences that well.
											And because we don&#39;t know
our preferences that well,
											we&#39;re susceptible to all of these
influences from the external forces:
											the defaults, the particular options
that are presented to us, and so on.

											One more example of this.
											People believe that when we deal
with physical attraction,
											we see somebody, and we know immediately
whether we like them or not,
											if we&#39;re attracted or not.
											This is why we have
these four-minute dates.
											So I decided to do
this experiment with people.
											I&#39;ll show you images here, no real people,
but the experiment was with people.
											I showed some people a picture
of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.
											and I said, &quot;Who do you want to date?
											Tom or Jerry?&quot;
											But for half the people,
I added an ugly version of Jerry.
											I took Photoshop and I made
Jerry slightly less attractive.

									<p>
											For the other people, I added
an ugly version of Tom.
											And the question was,
will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom
											help their respective,
more attractive brothers?
											The answer was absolutely yes.
											When ugly Jerry was around,
Jerry was popular.
											When ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.

											What is the general point?
											The general point is that,

this beautiful view of human nature.
											&quot;What a piece of work is a man!

											We have this view of ourselves, of others.
