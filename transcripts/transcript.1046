											Think about this:
food is a form of energy.
											It&#39;s what our body runs on,
											but it&#39;s also a form of power.
											And when we encourage people
to grow some of their own food,
											we&#39;re encouraging them
to take power into their hands,
											power over their diet,
											power over their health
											and some power over their pocketbooks.
											So I think that&#39;s quite subversive,
because we&#39;re also necessarily
											talking about taking that power away
											from someone else,
											from other actors in society
that currently have power
											over food and health.
											You can think about
who those actors might be.

											The reality is that we are in the midst
of an obesity epidemic,
											and it&#39;s not simply
limited to our country.
											It&#39;s spreading around the world right now.
											And in a sort of parallel universe,
											we&#39;re also seeing
that hunger is on the rise.
											Over 900 million people
right now are affected by it.
											That&#39;s three times the population
of the United States.

											world food prices are rising

											Now, another thing about the population
is we know that it&#39;s increasing,
											but a lot of us don&#39;t realize
that it&#39;s also changing.
											There&#39;s a fundamental shift taking place.
											As of 2007, we went from being
a primarily rural planet
											to being a primarily urban one,
											and that has implications
for how we&#39;re going to feed these people,
											how we&#39;re going to get the food
to the people in the cities.
											Now, I imagine that there are
some Stephen King fans
											in the audience here,
											and I&#39;m one of them.
											But I can tell you, I haven&#39;t read
anything scarier than this here,
											and that&#39;s this statistic:
											in order to keep up
with the growing population,
											we&#39;re going to need to grow more food
over the course of the next 50 years
											than we have grown over the course
of the past 10,000 years combined.

											What makes this even more challenging
											is that we&#39;re going to need
to grow all this food with less,
											and when I say less,
											I mean a number of things.
											Less oil, for example.
											Most reputable geologists believe
that we&#39;ve already reached
											peak oil production in the world.
											Now, you might not think in terms
of oil and food as being linked,
											but there&#39;s a very strong link, in fact.
											It takes 10 calories of fossil fuel energy
											in our highly industrialized food system
											in order to produce
one calorie of food energy.
											We&#39;ll also need to grow
more food with less water.
											These three images come from three
very different parts of the planet,

of catastrophic drought.

against climate change.
											We heard earlier today

about the ticking time bomb

the amount of time we all have
											in order to put
a decent meal on the table.

is not something arbitrary.
											That&#39;s the average amount of time
the American family spends

to need to also fit in growing food.
											Alright?
											And I think we do need to do that,

that somewhere along the way,
											something&#39;s going to have to give.

											So we have this sort of
shopper&#39;s dilemma right now.
											We have all of these different foods —
											30,000 foods in the average
big-box grocery store —
											but we have less confidence
in those foods,
											and we have less confidence in the actors
											that are putting those foods
on the shelves.
											I think we need to redefine
what good food is.
											This is an interesting image
from Berlin, Germany,
											where somebody started planting
shopping carts and leaving them around.
											Those are potatoes, by the way.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But in addition to redefining
what good food is,
											I think we need to redefine
our living spaces.
											Instead of seeing this as a yard,
											we need to think of it more
as like a full-service greengrocer.
											That&#39;s, in fact, my yard,
and that&#39;s how I look at it.
											That&#39;s what we transformed our yard into,
											and I think a really key
message is this one:
											gardens grow good food.
											And when I say good food,
											I mean a number of different things.
											I mean food that is safe,
											food that is healthy,
											food that is absolutely gorgeous

											Another important message is this one:
											gardens grow healthy kids and families.
											Those happen to be my two youngest sons,
											and they look healthy
and they are healthy,
											and I think it has to do with the fact
that they grew up in gardens
											and they know where good food comes from.
											And in fact, they know how
to grow some of it themselves.
											But in the current economy,
I think it&#39;s key to get this message out,
											that gardens also grow
important economic savings for families.
											And you can pretty much
take my word on this one,
											because in addition to crunching
the vegetables a couple of years ago,
											my wife and I also crunched the numbers,
											and we found out that at the end,
											we had saved well over 2,000 dollars
by growing our own food.

											So you could be asking this question now:
											If gardens grow all of these great things,
how do we grow more gardens?
											That&#39;s, in fact, the question
that my organization,
											Kitchen Gardens International,
											is both asking and answering.
											And our answer is essentially this one:
											we&#39;re going to need to leverage
the resources and power that we have,
											the gardens and gardeners that we have,
											in order to grow and inspire even more.
											And as I said before, you never know
who you might inspire.

											Now if this campaign was successful,
											I think it wasn&#39;t simply because we had
a visionary First Lady
											taking up residence at the White House —
											that certainly was a major part of it —
											and it wasn&#39;t simply because we had
some celebrity chefs and authors
											saying this would be a good idea to do.
											I think it was ultimately made possible
											by the fact that there were
a lot of people who wanted it to happen.
											There was a movement that made it happen.
											And my organization tried
to sort of channel some of that energy
											of the movement
											and direct it towards the White House.
											And we had a lot of luck
											in terms of getting our message
out there to the media.
											We had a petition on Facebook,
110,000 signatures.
											We had viral images and videos,
											and we did crazy things like
symbolically putting the White House lawn

											But we need to do even more,
											and what we&#39;re trying to do
in my organization
											is to connect people online,
											but also to connect people in person.
											This is an image from a little
holiday we invented
											called &quot;World Kitchen Garden Day.&quot;
											It&#39;s at the end of August each year,
											and it&#39;s just about bringing
people together in gardens
											to learn from one another,
											to experience a garden
as a community experience.
											We also need to grow

									<p>
											But there&#39;s still so much more
that needs to be done,
											and I think this slide sort of captures
where we need to go.
											We need a road map,
											and I picked this slide for a reason.
											We&#39;ve got a bike garden on the left
											and a map of the Netherlands on the right.
											I was in the Netherlands early this year
											and was absolutely amazed
by the amount of bikes on the road;
											26 percent of all trips taken
in the Netherlands are by bicycle,
											and it&#39;s gotten me thinking:
											How do we get that happening
in terms of food and gardens?
											How would we get 26 percent of all produce
coming from backyard gardens?
											That might sound like a lot,
											because we&#39;re probably at about
two percent at the most right now.
											But if you take into consideration
											that at the peak of the victory garden
movement last century,
											40 percent of all produce
was coming from gardens.
											We can get there again.
											And I think this is a really good start.
											The White House garden
is certainly very inspirational.
											That&#39;s actually sort of a snapshot
of what the garden looked like
											when it was planted earlier this spring —
											lots of diversity, lots of healthy crops.
											However, this is not a good representation
											of our federal agriculture policy.

											In terms of other things
that we need to be doing,

At least it was.
											It&#39;s from Michigan earlier this year.

a mother of four,

a 93-day jail sentence

											We still have laws from the 20th century.

to the realities that we are facing now.
											We need to figure out also
new ways of getting people into gardens,
											people who don&#39;t have yards.
											I think we also need to set
garden entrepreneurism free,
											and I&#39;m happy to say, as a Mainer,
											that we are leading the way in this area.
											Earlier this year, a number of Maine towns
											passed local food sovereignty laws
											that allow town residents
to not only grow food
											where they want to grow it
											but to also sell it
the way they want to sell it
											and to the people they want to sell it to.
											I think that&#39;s an incentive.

											But beyond that, I think we need
to reexamine the infrastructure
											that we have in place for gardens.
											I think we need to create
new infrastructure.
											And this is one of the things
my organization is working on right now,
											sort of a local communications
infrastructure, very place-based,
											that allows people in the same area
to connect with one another
											and to help each other out.
											I think we&#39;re lacking this
at the moment —

											In addition to that, I think we need
another type of infrastructure.
											It would be good if we could
all get together.
											I think if we&#39;ve learned anything
through the TED experience,
											it&#39;s that there is power
when we bring people together,
											and I think we need to bring people
together at the local level as well.
											And I think we can take some inspiration
from a previous movement,
											which was the grange movement,
											a rural movement which brought farmers
together in a single building
											to meet and to recreate
and learn how to become better farmers.
											I think we need a network
											of suburban granges now.

											I think one of the last
things that we need
											is to not lose the fun of food.
											Food is at its best when it&#39;s delicious
but shared as part of a community,
											and I think that gardens can get
some of that community vibe back as well.
											So I&#39;m going to leave with one last video,
											and I&#39;m going to revisit the short video
that I showed you before,
											but I&#39;m going to suggest
an alternative ending.
											And I think this ending
is well within our reach,
											but it&#39;s really going to require
that we all pull together.
											So here&#39;s the new history of gastronomy.
