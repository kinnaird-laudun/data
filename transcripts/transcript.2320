											I would actually argue
that we&#39;re already augmented.
											Imagine you&#39;re at a party,
											and somebody asks you a question
that you don&#39;t know the answer to.
											If you have one of these,
in a few seconds, you can know the answer.
											But this is just a primitive beginning.
											Even Siri is just a passive tool.
											In fact, for the last
three-and-a-half million years,
											the tools that we&#39;ve had
have been completely passive.
											They do exactly what we tell them
and nothing more.
											Our very first tool only cut
where we struck it.
											The chisel only carves
where the artist points it.
											And even our most advanced tools
do nothing without our explicit direction.
											In fact, to date, and this
is something that frustrates me,
											we&#39;ve always been limited
											by this need to manually
push our wills into our tools —
											like, manual,
literally using our hands,
											even with computers.
											But I&#39;m more like Scotty in &quot;Star Trek.&quot;

											That conversation might be
a little ways off,
											probably less than many of us think,
											but right now,
											we&#39;re working on it.
											Tools are making this leap
from being passive to being generative.
											Generative design tools
use a computer and algorithms
											to synthesize geometry
											to come up with new designs
all by themselves.
											All it needs are your goals
and your constraints.

											I&#39;ll give you an example.
											In the case of this aerial drone chassis,
											all you would need to do
is tell it something like,
											it has four propellers,
											you want it to be
as lightweight as possible,
											and you need it to be
aerodynamically efficient.
											Then what the computer does
is it explores the entire solution space:
											every single possibility that solves
and meets your criteria —
											millions of them.
											It takes big computers to do this.
											But it comes back to us with designs
											that we, by ourselves,
never could&#39;ve imagined.
											And the computer&#39;s coming up
with this stuff all by itself —
											no one ever drew anything,
											and it started completely from scratch.
											And by the way, it&#39;s no accident
											that the drone body looks just like
the pelvis of a flying squirrel.

											What&#39;s exciting is we&#39;re starting
to see this technology
											out in the real world.
											We&#39;ve been working with Airbus
for a couple of years

											It&#39;s a ways out still.

a generative-design AI
											to come up with this.
											This is a 3D-printed cabin partition
that&#39;s been designed by a computer.
											It&#39;s stronger than the original
yet half the weight,
											and it will be flying
in the Airbus A320 later this year.
											So computers can now generate;

											But they&#39;re not intuitive.
											They still have to start from scratch

											If her owner picks up that leash,
											Maggie knows with a fair
degree of certainty
											it&#39;s time to go for a walk.

											Well, every time the owner picked up

											Interestingly, that&#39;s exactly what
											computer scientists
have been trying to get AIs to do
											for the last 60 or so years.
											Back in 1952,
											they built this computer
that could play Tic-Tac-Toe.
											Big deal.
											Then 45 years later, in 1997,
											Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.
											2011, Watson beats these two
humans at Jeopardy,
											which is much harder for a computer
to play than chess is.
											In fact, rather than working
from predefined recipes,
											Watson had to use reasoning
to overcome his human opponents.
											And then a couple of weeks ago,
											DeepMind&#39;s AlphaGo beats
the world&#39;s best human at Go,
											which is the most difficult
game that we have.
											In fact, in Go, there are more
possible moves
											than there are atoms in the universe.
											So in order to win,
											what AlphaGo had to do
was develop intuition.
											And in fact, at some points,
AlphaGo&#39;s programmers didn&#39;t understand

											Here&#39;s another cool project
that Bishop worked on.
											The goal of this project,
which we called the HIVE,
											was to prototype the experience
of humans, computers and robots
											all working together to solve
a highly complex design problem.
											The humans acted as labor.
											They cruised around the construction site,
they manipulated the bamboo —
											which, by the way,
because it&#39;s a non-isomorphic material,
											is super hard for robots to deal with.
											But then the robots
did this fiber winding,
											which was almost impossible
for a human to do.
											And then we had an AI
that was controlling everything.
											It was telling the humans what to do,
telling the robots what to do
											and keeping track of thousands
of individual components.
											What&#39;s interesting is,
											building this pavilion
was simply not possible
											without human, robot and AI
augmenting each other.

											OK, I&#39;ll share one more project.
This one&#39;s a little bit crazy.
											We&#39;re working with Amsterdam-based artist
Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D
											to generatively design
and robotically print
											the world&#39;s first autonomously
manufactured bridge.
											So, Joris and an AI are designing
this thing right now, as we speak,
											in Amsterdam.
											And when they&#39;re done,
we&#39;re going to hit &quot;Go,&quot;
											and robots will start 3D printing
in stainless steel,
											and then they&#39;re going to keep printing,
without human intervention,

											So, as computers are going
to augment our ability
											to imagine and design new stuff,
											robotic systems are going to help us
build and make things
											that we&#39;ve never been able to make before.
											But what about our ability

											Our nervous system,
the human nervous system,

we make is rudimentary at best.
											For instance, a car doesn&#39;t tell
the city&#39;s public works department

of Broadway and Morrison.
											A building doesn&#39;t tell its designers
											whether or not the people inside
like being there,
											and the toy manufacturer doesn&#39;t know
											if a toy is actually being played with —
											how and where and whether
or not it&#39;s any fun.

											If the designers had known
											what was really happening
in the real world
											with their designs — the road,

											they could&#39;ve used that knowledge
to create an experience
											that was better for the user.
											What&#39;s missing is a nervous system

											What if all of you had that kind

											With all of the stuff we make,
											we spend a tremendous amount
of money and energy —
											in fact, last year,
about two trillion dollars —

to the things that you design and create
