											So it was the fall of 1902,
											and President Theodore Roosevelt
											needed a little break from the White House,
											so he took a train to Mississippi
											to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town
											called Smedes.
											The first day of the hunt,
they didn&#39;t see a single bear,
											so it was a big bummer for everyone,
											but the second day, the dogs cornered one
											after a really long chase, but by that point,
											the president had given up
											and gone back to camp for lunch,
											so his hunting guide cracked the animal
											on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,
											and then tied it up to a tree
											and started tooting away on his bugle
											to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor
											of shooting it.
											The bear was a female.
											It was dazed, injured,
											severely underweight, a little mangy-looking,
											and when Roosevelt saw this animal
											tied up to the tree,
											he just couldn&#39;t bring himself to fire at it.
											He felt like that would go against his code
											as a sportsman.

											A few days later, the scene was memorialized
											in a political cartoon back in Washington.
											It was called &quot;Drawing a Line in Mississippi,&quot;
											and it showed Roosevelt with
his gun down and his arm out,
											sparing the bear&#39;s life,
											and the bear was sitting on its hind legs
											with these two big, frightened, wide eyes
											and little ears pricked up at the top of its head.
											It looked really helpless, like you just wanted to
											sweep it up into your arms
											and reassure it.
											It wouldn&#39;t have looked familiar at the time,
											but if you go looking for the cartoon now,
											you recognize the animal right away:
											It&#39;s a teddy bear.
											And this is how the teddy bear was born.
											Essentially, toymakers took
the bear from the cartoon,
											turned it into a plush toy, and then named it
											after President Roosevelt — Teddy&#39;s bear.

											And I do feel a little ridiculous
											that I&#39;m up here on this stage
											and I&#39;m choosing to use my time
											to tell you about a 100-year-old story
											about the invention of a squishy kid&#39;s toy,
											but I&#39;d argue that the invention of the teddy bear,
											inside that story is a more important story,
											a story about how dramatically our ideas
											about nature can change,
											and also about how, on the planet right now,
											the stories that we tell
											are dramatically changing nature.

											Because think about the teddy bear.
											For us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,
											because bears are so cute and cuddly,
											and who wouldn&#39;t want to give
one to their kids to play with,
											but the truth is that in 1902,
											bears weren&#39;t cute and cuddly.
											I mean, they looked the same,
											but no one thought of them that way.
											In 1902, bears were monsters.
											Bears were something that frickin&#39; terrified kids.
											For generations at that point,
											the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger
											that people were encountering on the frontier,
											and the federal government was actually
											systematically exterminating bears
											and lots of other predators too,
											like coyotes and wolves.
											These animals, they were being demonized.
											They were called murderers
											because they killed people&#39;s livestock.
											One government biologist, he explained this
											war on animals like the bear by saying
											that they no longer had a place
											in our advancing civilization,
											and so we were just clearing them out of the way.
											In one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves
											had been slaughtered.
											The grizzly would soon be wiped out
											from 95 percent of its original territory,
											and whereas once there had been 30 million bison
											moving across the plains, and you would have
											these stories of trains having to stop
											for four or five hours so that these thick,
											living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,
											now, by 1902, there were maybe 
less than 100 left in the wild.
											And so what I&#39;m saying is, the teddy bear was born
											into the middle of this great spasm of extermination,
											and you can see it as a sign that
											maybe some people deep down
											were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing.
											America still hated the bear and feared it,
											but all of a sudden, America also wanted
											to give the bear a great big hug.

											So this is something that I&#39;ve been really
curious about in the last few years.
											How do we imagine animals,
											how do we think and feel about them,
											and how do their reputations get written
											and then rewritten in our minds?
											We&#39;re here living in the eye of a great storm
											of extinction where half the species on the planet
											could be gone by the end of the century,
											and so why is it that we come to care about
											some of those species and not others?
											Well, there&#39;s a new field, a relatively new field
											of social science that started looking at
											these questions and trying to unpack the powerful
											and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships
											that we have to animals,
											and I spent a lot of time looking through
											their academic journals,
											and all I can really say is that their findings
											are astonishingly wide-ranging.
											So some of my favorites include that
											the more television a person
watches in Upstate New York,
											the more he or she is afraid
											of being attacked by a black bear.
											If you show a tiger to an American,
											they&#39;re much more likely to assume that it&#39;s female
											and not male.
											In a study where a fake snake
											and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,
											drivers hit the snake much
more often than the turtle,
											and about three percent of
drivers who hit the fake animals
											seemed to do it on purpose.
											Women are more likely than men to get a
											&quot;magical feeling&quot; when they see dolphins in the surf.
											Sixty-eight percent of mothers with
											&quot;high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem&quot;
											identified with the dancing cats
											in a commercial for Purina. (Laughter)
											Americans consider lobsters
											more important than pigeons
											but also much, much stupider.
											Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly
more dangerous than sea otters,
											and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs.

											So some of this is physical, right?
											We tend to sympathize more
with animals that look like us,
											and especially that resemble human babies,
											so with big, forward-facing eyes
											and circular faces,
											kind of a roly-poly posture.
											This is why, if you get a Christmas card from, like,
											your great aunt in Minnesota,
											there&#39;s usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it,
											and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider.
											But it&#39;s not all physical, right?
											There&#39;s a cultural dimension to
how we think about animals,
											and we&#39;re telling stories about these animals,
											and like all stories,
											they are shaped by the times and the places
											in which we&#39;re telling them.
											So think about that moment
											back in 1902 again where a ferocious bear
											became a teddy bear.
											What was the context?
Well, America was urbanizing.
											For the first time, nearly a
majority of people lived in cities,
											so there was a growing distance
between us and nature.
											There was a safe space where we could
											reconsider the bear and romanticize it.
											Nature could only start to
seem this pure and adorable
											because we didn&#39;t have to be afraid of it anymore.
											And you can see that cycle playing out
											again and again with all kinds of animals.
											It seems like we&#39;re always stuck between
											demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,
											and then when we get very close to doing that,
											empathizing with it as an underdog
											and wanting to show it compassion.
											So we exert our power,
											but then we&#39;re unsettled
											by how powerful we are.

											So for example, this is one of
											probably thousands of letters and drawings
											that kids sent to the Bush administration,
											begging it to protect the polar bear
											under the Endangered Species Act,
											and these were sent back in the mid-2000s,
											when awareness of climate
change was suddenly surging.
											We kept seeing that image of a polar bear
											stranded on a little ice floe
											looking really morose.
											I spent days looking through these files.
											I really love them. This one&#39;s my favorite.
											If you can see, it&#39;s a polar bear that&#39;s drowning
											and then it&#39;s also being eaten simultaneously
											by a lobster and a shark.
											This one came from a kid named Fritz,
											and he&#39;s actually got a solution to climate change.
											He&#39;s got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.
											He says, &quot;I feel bad about the polar bears.
											I like polar bears.
											Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz.&quot;
											So 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorers
											writing about polar bears leaping into their boats
											and trying to devour them,
											even if they lit the bear on fire,
											but these kids don&#39;t see the polar bear that way,
											and actually they don&#39;t even see the polar bear
											the way that I did back in the &#39;80s.
											I mean, we thought of these animals
											as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic.
											But look now how quickly that climate change
											has flipped the image of the animal in our minds.
											It&#39;s gone from that bloodthirsty man-killer
											to this delicate, drowning victim,
											and when you think about it, that&#39;s kind of
											the conclusion to the story
											that the teddy bear started telling back in 1902,
											because back then, America had more or less
											conquered its share of the continent.
											We were just getting around to
											polishing off these last wild predators.
											Now, society&#39;s reach has expanded
											all the way to the top of the world,
											and it&#39;s made even these, the most remote,
											the most powerful bears on the planet,
											seem like adorable and blameless victims.

									<p>
											But you know, there&#39;s also a
postscript to the teddy bear story
											that not a lot of people talk about.
											We&#39;re going to talk about it,
											because even though it didn&#39;t really take long
											after Roosevelt&#39;s hunt in 1902
											for the toy to become a full-blown craze,
											most people figured it was a fad,
											it was a sort of silly political novelty item
											and it would go away once the president left office,
											and so by 1909, when Roosevelt&#39;s successor,
											William Howard Taft,
											was getting ready to be inaugurated,
											the toy industry was on the hunt
											for the next big thing.
											They didn&#39;t do too well.

											That January, Taft was the guest of honor
											at a banquet in Atlanta,
											and for days in advance,
											the big news was the menu.
											They were going to be serving him
											a Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,
											called possum and taters.
											So you would have a whole opossum
											roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,
											and then sometimes they&#39;d leave
											the big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.
											The one brought to Taft&#39;s table
											weighed 18 pounds.
											So after dinner, the orchestra started to play,
											and the guests burst into song,
											and all of a sudden, Taft was surprised
											with the presentation of a gift
											from a group of local supporters,
											and this was a stuffed opossum toy,
											all beady-eyed and bald-eared,
											and it was a new product they were putting forward
											to be the William Taft presidency&#39;s answer
											to Teddy Roosevelt&#39;s teddy bear.
											They were calling it the &quot;billy possum.&quot;
											Within 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Company
											was up and running, brokering deals
											for these things nationwide,
											and the Los Angeles Times announced,
											very confidently, &quot;The teddy bear
											has been relegated to a seat in the rear,
											and for four years, possibly eight,
											the children of the United States
											will play with billy possum.&quot;
											So from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.
											There were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,
											billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.
											There were smaller billy possums on a stick
											that kids could wave around like flags.
											But even with all this marketing,
											the life of the billy possum
											turned out to be just pathetically brief.
											The toy was an absolute flop,
											and it was almost completely forgotten
											by the end of the year,
											and what that means is that the billy possum
											didn&#39;t even make it to Christmastime,
											which when you think about it is
											a special sort of tragedy for a toy.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we can explain that failure two ways.
											The first, well, it&#39;s pretty obvious.
											I&#39;m going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:
											Opossums are hideous. (Laughter)
											But maybe more importantly is that
											the story of the billy possum was all wrong,
											especially compared
											to the backstory of the teddy bear.
											Think about it: for most of
human&#39;s evolutionary history,
											what&#39;s made bears impressive to us
											has been their complete independence from us.
											It&#39;s that they live these parallel lives
											as menaces and competitors.
											By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,
											that stature was being crushed,
											and the animal that he had roped to a tree
											really was a symbol for all bears.
											Whether those animals lived or died now
											was entirely up to the compassion
											or the indifference of people.
											That said something really ominous
											about the future of bears,
											but it also said something very 
unsettling about who we&#39;d become,
											if the survival of even an animal like that
											was up to us now.
											So now, a century later, if you&#39;re at all
											paying attention to what&#39;s
happening in the environment,
											you feel that discomfort so much more intensely.
											We&#39;re living now in an age of what scientists
											have started to call &quot;conservation reliance,&quot;
											and what that term means is that we&#39;ve disrupted
											so much that nature can&#39;t possibly
stand on its own anymore,
											and most endangered species
											are only going to survive
											if we stay out there in the landscape
											riggging the world around them in their favor.
											So we&#39;ve gone hands-on
											and we can&#39;t ever take our hands off,
											and that&#39;s a hell of a lot of work.
											Right now, we&#39;re training condors
											not to perch on power lines.
											We teach whooping cranes
to migrate south for the winter
											behind little ultra-light airplanes.
											We&#39;re out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.
											We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.
											So we&#39;ve gone from annihilating species
											to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species
											indefinitely, and which ones?
											Well, the ones that we&#39;ve told
											compelling stories about,
											the ones we&#39;ve decided ought to stick around.
											The line between conservation and domestication
											is blurred.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what I&#39;ve been saying is that the stories
											that we tell about wild animals are so subjective
											they can be irrational
											or romanticized or sensationalized.
											Sometimes they just have
nothing to do with the facts.
											But in a world of conservation reliance,
											those stories have very real consequences,
											because now, how we feel about an animal
											affects its survival
											more than anything that you read about
											in ecology textbooks.
											Storytelling matters now.
											Emotion matters.
											Our imagination has become an ecological force.
											And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part
											because the legend of Roosevelt
											and that bear in Mississippi
											was kind of like an allegory
											of this great responsibility that society
											was just beginning to face up to back then.
											It would be another 71 years
											before the Endangered Species Act was passed,
											but really, here&#39;s its whole ethos
											boiled down into something like a scene
											you&#39;d see in a stained glass window.
											The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,
											and the president of the United States
											decided to show it some mercy.
											Thank you.
											(Applause)
