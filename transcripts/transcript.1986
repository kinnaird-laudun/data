											It&#39;s true — my mom
and especially my dad always said:
											&quot;Respect your opponent,
and never underestimate them, ever.&quot;
											And he was correct.
He was absolutely correct.
											But I knew it was about social change.
											And I was really nervous
whenever we announced it,
											and I felt like the whole world
was on my shoulders.
											And I thought, &quot;If I lose, it&#39;s going
to put women back 50 years, at least.&quot;
											Title IX had just been passed
the year before — June 23, 1972.
											And women&#39;s professional tennis —
											there were nine of us who signed
a one-dollar contract in 1970 —
											now remember, the match is in &#39;73.
											So we were only in our
third year of having a tour
											where we could actually play,
have a place to compete and make a living.
											So there were nine of us that signed
that one-dollar contract.
											And our dream was for any girl,
born any place in the world —
											if she was good enough —
											there would be a place for her to compete
and for us to make a living.
											Because before 1968,
we made 14 dollars a day,
											and we were under the control
of organizations.
											So we really wanted
to break away from that.
											But we knew it wasn&#39;t really
about our generation so much;
											we knew it was about
the future generations.

											We do stand on the shoulders of the people
that came before us, there is no question.
											But every generation
has the chance to make it better.
											That was really on my mind.
											I really wanted to start matching
the hearts and minds to Title IX.
											Title IX, in case anybody doesn&#39;t know,
which a lot of people probably don&#39;t,
											said that any federal funds given
to a high school, college or university,
											either public or private,
											had to — finally —

to play in tournaments

at the end of the year.
											So I was daydreaming
at the Los Angeles Tennis Club,

and how tiny it was,
											but also that everybody who played
wore white shoes, white clothes,
											played with white balls —
everybody who played was white.
											And I said to myself, at 12 years old,
&quot;Where is everyone else?&quot;
											And that just kept sticking in my brain.
											And that moment,
											I promised myself I&#39;d fight
for equal rights and opportunities
											for boys and girls, men and women,
the rest of my life.
											And that tennis, if I was fortunate
enough to become number one —
											and I knew, being a girl,
it would be harder to have influence,
											already at that age —
											that I had this platform.
											And tennis is global.
											And I thought, &quot;You know what?
											I&#39;ve been given an opportunity
that very few people have had.&quot;
											I didn&#39;t know if I was going
to make it — this was only 12.
											I sure wanted it, but making it
is a whole other discussion.

a perfect example.
											An African American woman
gets up an hour earlier to go to work,

											goes to the bathroom
probably four, five, six times a day
											to keep straightening her hair,
to keep making sure she fits in.
											So she&#39;s working two jobs.
											She&#39;s got this other job,
whatever that may be,
											but she&#39;s also trying to fit in.
											Or this poor man who kept his diploma —
											he went to University of Michigan,
											but he never would talk about
his poverty as a youngster, ever —
											just would not mention it.
											So he made sure they saw
he was well-educated.
											And then you see a gay guy
who has an NFL —
											which means American football
for all of you out there,
											it&#39;s a big deal, it&#39;s very macho —
											and he talked about football all the time,
											because he was gay
and he didn&#39;t want anybody to know.
											It just goes on and on.
											So my wish for everyone is to be able
to be their authentic self 24/7,
											that would be the ultimate.
