									<p>
											Two weeks ago,
											I was sitting at the kitchen table
with my wife Katya,
											and we were talking about
what I was going to talk about today.
											We have an 11-year-old son;
his name is Lincoln.
											He was sitting at the same table,
doing his math homework.
											And during a pause
in my conversation with Katya,
											I looked over at Lincoln
											and I was suddenly thunderstruck
											by a recollection of a client of mine.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											My client was a guy named Will.
											He was from North Texas.
											He never knew his father very well,
											because his father left his mom
while she was pregnant with him.
											And so, he was destined
to be raised by a single mom,
											which might have been all right
											except that this particular single mom
was a paranoid schizophrenic,
											and when Will was five years old,
											she tried to kill him
with a butcher knife.

									<p>
											She was taken away by authorities
and placed in a psychiatric hospital,
											and so for the next several years
Will lived with his older brother,
											until he committed suicide
by shooting himself through the heart.
											And after that Will bounced around
from one family member to another,
											until, by the time he was nine years old,
he was essentially living on his own.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That morning that I was sitting
with Katya and Lincoln,
											I looked at my son, and I realized
that when my client, Will, was his age,
											he&#39;d been living by himself for two years.
											Will eventually joined a gang
											and committed a number
of very serious crimes,
											including, most seriously of all,
											a horrible, tragic murder.
											And Will was ultimately executed
as punishment for that crime.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But I don&#39;t want to talk today
about the morality of capital punishment.
											I certainly think that my client
shouldn&#39;t have been executed,
											but what I would like to do today instead
											is talk about the death penalty
in a way I&#39;ve never done before,
											in a way that is
entirely noncontroversial.

									<p>
											I think that&#39;s possible,
											because there is a corner
of the death penalty debate —
											maybe the most important corner —
											where everybody agrees,
											where the most ardent
death penalty supporters
											and the most vociferous abolitionists
are on exactly the same page.
											That&#39;s the corner I want to explore.

									<p>
											Before I do that, though,
I want to spend a couple of minutes
											telling you how
a death penalty case unfolds,
											and then I want to tell you two lessons
											that I have learned over the last 20 years
as a death penalty lawyer
											from watching well more
than a hundred cases unfold in this way.

									<p>
											You can think of a death penalty case
as a story that has four chapters.
											The first chapter of every case
is exactly the same, and it is tragic.
											It begins with the murder
of an innocent human being,
											and it&#39;s followed by a trial
											where the murderer
is convicted and sent to death row,
											and that death sentence is ultimately
upheld by the state appellate court.

											The second chapter consists

more complicated legal proceeding

											When I started representing
death row inmates more than 20 years ago,
											people on death row
did not have a right to a lawyer
											in either the second
or the fourth chapter of this story.
											They were on their own.
											In fact, it wasn&#39;t until the late 1980s
											that they acquired a right to a lawyer
during the third chapter of the story.
											So what all of these death row inmates
had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers
											to handle their legal proceedings.
											The problem is that there were
way more guys on death row
											than there were lawyers
											who had both the interest
and the expertise to work on these cases.

											And so inevitably,
											lawyers drifted to cases
that were already in chapter four —
											that makes sense, of course.
											Those are the cases that are most urgent;
											those are the guys
who are closest to being executed.
											Some of these lawyers were successful;
											they managed to get
new trials for their clients.
											Others of them managed
to extend the lives of their clients,
											sometimes by years, sometimes by months.

											But the one thing that didn&#39;t happen
											was that there was never
a serious and sustained decline
											in the number of annual
executions in Texas.
											In fact, as you can see from this graph,
											from the time that the Texas
execution apparatus got efficient
											in the mid- to late 1990s,
											there have only been a couple of years
											where the number of annual
executions dipped below 20.

											In a typical year in Texas,
											we&#39;re averaging about two people a month.
											In some years in Texas,
we&#39;ve executed close to 40 people,
											and this number has never significantly
declined over the last 15 years.
											And yet, at the same time
that we continue to execute
											about the same number
of people every year,
											the number of people who we&#39;re
sentencing to death on an annual basis
											has dropped rather steeply.

											So we have this paradox,
											which is that the number
of annual executions has remained high
											but the number of new
death sentences has gone down.
											Why is that?
											It can&#39;t be attributed
to a decline in the murder rate,
											because the murder
rate has not declined nearly so steeply
											as the red line
on that graph has gone down.
											What has happened instead
											is that juries have started to sentence
more and more people to prison

to the execution chamber.

											It hasn&#39;t happened
because of a dissolution

											Death penalty opponents
take great solace in the fact
											that death penalty support in Texas
is at an all-time low.
											Do you know what all-time low
in Texas means?
											It means that it&#39;s in the low 60 percent.
											Now, that&#39;s really good
compared to the mid-1980s,
											when it was in excess of 80 percent,
											but we can&#39;t explain
the decline in death sentences
											and the affinity for life
without the possibility of parole
											by an erosion of support
for the death penalty,

the death penalty.

											Now, you might think
that this decline in death sentences

in the number of life sentences

											I don&#39;t want to have a conversation
about that today.
											All that I want to tell you
is that the reason that this has happened

have understood

											I sometimes say, if you tell me
the name of a death row inmate —
											doesn&#39;t matter what state he&#39;s in,
											doesn&#39;t matter
if I&#39;ve ever met him before —

											Eighty percent of the people on death row

to the juvenile justice system.
