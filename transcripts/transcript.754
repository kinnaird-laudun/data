											Every presentation needs this slide in it.
											(Laughter)
											It&#39;s beautiful, isn&#39;t it?
											Do you see?
											All the points, all the lines —
											it&#39;s incredible.
											It is the network;
											and in my case, the network has been important in media,
											because I get to connect to people.
											Isn&#39;t it amazing?
											Through that, I connect to people.
											And the way that I&#39;ve been doing it
											has been multifaceted.
											For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.
											(Laughter)
											I put together projects like Earth Sandwich,
											where I ask people
											to try and simultaneously place
											two pieces of bread
											perfectly opposite each other on the Earth.
											And people started laying bread in tribute,
											and eventually a team was able to do it
											between New Zealand and Spain.
											It&#39;s pretty incredible — the video&#39;s online.
											Connecting to people in projects
											like YoungmeNowme for example.
											In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked
											to find a childhood photograph of themselves
											and restage it as an adult.
											(Laughter)
											This is the same person —
											top photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer].
											Poignant.
											This was a Mother&#39;s Day gift.
											(Laughter)
											Particularly creepy.
											(Applause)
											(Laughter)
											My favorite of these photos, which I couldn&#39;t find,
											is there&#39;s a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so
											with a little baby on her lap,
											and the next photo is a 220-lb man
											with a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.

											But this project changed the way
											that I thought about connecting to people.
											This is project called Ray.
											And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio
											and had no idea who generated the audio.
											Somebody said, &quot;You have to listen to this.&quot;
											And this is what came to me.

											Recording: Hi, my name is Ray,
											and on yesterday my daughter called me
											because she was stressed out
											because of things that were going on on her job
											that she felt was quite unfair.
											Being quite disturbed, she called for comfort,
											and I didn&#39;t really know what to tell her,
											because we have to deal with so much mess in our society.
											So I was led to write this song just for her,
											just to give her some encouragement
											while dealing with stress and pressures on her job.
											And I figured I&#39;d put it on the Internet
											for all employees under stress
											to help you better deal with what you&#39;re going through on your job.
											Here&#39;s how the song goes.

											realizing that someone was feeling something,
											wanting to affect them in a particular way,
											using media to do it, putting it online
											and realizing that there was a greater impact.
											This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.
											So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him.
											And I asked my audience, I said, &quot;Listen to this piece of audio.
											We have to remix it. He&#39;s got a great voice.
											It&#39;s actually in the key of B flat.
											And have to do something with it.&quot;
											Hundreds of remixes came back — lots of different attempts.
											One stood out in particular.
											It was done by a guy named Goose.

											ZF: Great, so it was incredible.
											That song — (Applause) Thank you.
											So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game
											in Kansas City.
											In the end,
											it was one of the top downloads
											on a whole bunch of music streaming services.
											And so I said, &quot;Let&#39;s put this together in an album.&quot;
											And the audience came together, and they designed an album cover.
											And I said, &quot;If you put it all on this, I&#39;m going to deliver it to him,
											if you can figure out who this person is,&quot;
											because all I had was his name — Ray —
											and this little piece of audio
											and the fact that his daughter was upset.
											In two weeks, they found him.
											I received and email and it said,
											&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Ray.
											I heard you were looking for me.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And I was like, &quot;Yeah, Ray.
											It&#39;s been an interesting two weeks.&quot;
											And so I flew to St. Louis

											So but anyways, here&#39;s the thing —
											is it reminds me of this,
											which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.
											And it&#39;s sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.
											I look at this photo, and he seems really interested
											in what&#39;s going on with that button,
											but it doesn&#39;t seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street.
											(Laughter)
											And it makes me think of this.
											On street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones,
											and it&#39;s easy to dismiss this
											as some sort of bad trend
											in human culture.
											But the truth is
											life is being lived there.
											When they smile —
											right, you&#39;ve seen people stop —
											all of a sudden, life is being lived there,
											somewhere up in that weird, dense network.
											And this is it, right, to feel and be felt.
											It&#39;s the fundamental force
											that we&#39;re all after.
											We can build all sorts of environments
											to make it a little bit easier,
											but ultimately, what we&#39;re trying to do
											is really connect with one other person.
											And that&#39;s not always going to happen in physical spaces.
											It&#39;s also going to now happen in virtual spaces,
											and we have to get better at figuring that out.
											I think, of the people that build all this technology in the network,
											a lot of them aren&#39;t very good
											at connecting with people.
											This is kind of like something I used to do
											in third grade.

											So here&#39;s a series of projects
											over the last few years
											where I&#39;ve been inspired by trying to figure out
											how to really facilitate close connection.
											Sometimes they&#39;re very, very simple things.
											A Childhood Walk, which is a project
											where I ask people to remember a walk
											that they used to take as a child over and over again
											that was sort of meaningless —
											like on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor&#39;s house,
											and take it inside of Google Streetview.
											And I promise you,
											if you take that walk inside Google Streetview,
											you come to a moment
											where something comes back
											and hits you in the face.
											And I collected those moments —
											the photos inside Google Streetview
											and the memories, specifically.
											&quot;Our conversation started with me saying, &#39;I&#39;m bored,&#39;
											and her replying, &#39;When I&#39;m bored I eat pretzels.&#39;
											I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot.&quot;
											&quot;Right after he told me and my brother
											he was going to be separating from my mom,
											I remember walking to a convenience store
											and getting a cherry cola.&quot;
											&quot;They used some of the morbidly artist footage,
											a close-up of Chad&#39;s shoes in the middle of the highway.
											I guess the shoes came off when he was hit.
											He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.
											It had &#39;Chad&#39; written in magic marker on it.
											He died long after he left the pillow at my house,
											but we never got around to returning it.&quot;

											Sometimes they&#39;re a little bit more abstract.
											This is Pain Pack.
											Right after September 11th, last year,
											I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it,
											the way that we excise it from our bodies.
											So what I did is I opened up a hotline —
											a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain,
											not necessarily related to that event.
											And people called in and left messages like this.

											Recording: Okay, here&#39;s something.
											I&#39;m not alone,
											and I am loved.
											I&#39;m really fortunate.
											But sometimes I feel really lonely.
											And when I feel that way
											even the smallest act of kindness
											can make me cry.
											Like even people in convenience stores
											saying, &quot;Have a nice day,&quot;
											when they&#39;re accidentally looking me in the eye.

											ZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails,
											and with their permission, converted them to MP3s
											and distributed them to sound editors
											who created short sounds
											using just those voicemails.
											And those were then distributed to DJs
											who have made hundreds of songs

											&quot;From 52 to 48 with love&quot;
											was a project around the time of the last election cycle,
											where McCain and Obama both,
											in their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation,
											and I was like, &quot;What the hell
											does that look like?&quot;
											So I thought, &quot;Well let&#39;s just give it a try.
											Let&#39;s have people hold up signs about reconciliation.&quot;
											And so some really nice things came together.
											&quot;I voted blue. I voted red.
											Together, for our future.&quot;
											These are very, very cute little things right.
											Some came from the winning party.
											&quot;Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always.&quot;
											Some came from the party who had just lost.
											&quot;From a 48 to a 52, may your party&#39;s leadership be as classy as you,
											but I doubt it.&quot;
											But the truth was that as this start becoming popular,
											a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards
											apparently found it to be a little patronizing,
											which I could also see.
											And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail,
											death threats even.
											And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages,
											and he was dressed as Batman.
											And he said, &quot;I&#39;m dressed as Batman to hide my identity.&quot;
											Just in case I thought the real Batman
											was coming after me;
											which actually made me feel a little better —

											So what I did —
											unfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of
											awful experience and this pain inside of me,
											and it started to eat away at my psyche.
											And I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it —
											I didn&#39;t want this special, little group of photographs
											to get sullied in some way.
											So what I did, I took all those emails,
											and I put them together into something called Angrigami,
											which was an origami template
											made out of this sort of vile stuff.
											And I asked people to send me beautiful things
											made out of the Angrigami.
											(Laughter)
											But this was the emotional moment.
											One of my viewer&#39;s uncles died on a particular day
											and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate.
											It&#39;s amazing.

											And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.

											And I chose two people to be,
											and I asked them to send me descriptions
											of how to act as them on Facebook.
											One person sent me a very detailed description;
											the other person didn&#39;t.
											And the person who didn&#39;t, it turned out,
											had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.
											So, you know, people were writing me and saying, &quot;How&#39;s your new job?&quot;

											But anyway, this same person, Laura,

											And I felt badly for not having done a good job.
											And she said, &quot;I&#39;m really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job,
											and I&#39;ve just had this incredible amount of anxiety.&quot;
											So she had seen the &quot;Scared&quot; song and wondered if I could do something.
											So I asked her, &quot;What does it feel like when you feel this way?&quot;
											And she wrote a sort of descriptive set
											of what it felt like to have had this anxiety.
											And so what I decided to do.

He defines, in many ways, the genre of online comedy, and continues to innovate madly on the form.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2006 he launched a year-long daily video blog called <em><a href=\"http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/\" target=\"_blank\">The Show with Ze Frank</a></em>, which Slate.com called &quot;the best sustained comedy run in the history of the Web.&quot; His rapid-fire delivery and absurd explorations in audience participation (like Earth Sandwich) has influenced a generation of digital native YouTubers. Perhap his most brilliant move: calling on fans to write the show for him.  Using collaborative tools, online viewers collectively put words in his  mouth (and props in his lap); he faithfully performed this wiki-comedy  each week for his &quot;Fabuloso Friday&quot; show.</p><p>In 2008, along with Erik Kastner, Frank launched Colowars, the first massively multiplayer game on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zefrank\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, which featured two months of sponsored online events and competitions. Recently he has worked with his audience to create a series of projects based on shared emotions such as pain, fear and the pang of nostalgia. Frank works as a consultant to range of industries on audience engagement and is a public speaker on the subject of the virtual life. </p><p>In 2012 he returned to the internet airwaves with &quot;<a href=\"http://ashow.zefrank.com/\" target=\"_blank\">A Show</a>.&quot; About which a MetaFilter <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/114710/Thats-my-Cheese-Monster-talking#4285622\" target=\"_blank\">commenter</a>  wrote:</p><p>If this were a cult, I would join.<br /><br />If this were a religion, I would attend services.<br /><br />If this were a band, I would not torrent the albums, but buy them, full price, from a local independent record store.<br /><br />If this were a telethon, I would buy multiple tote bags.<br /><br />Welcome back, Ze. </p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/ze_frank_s_web_playroom","viewed_count":1946941,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"On the web, a new \"Friend\" may be just a click away, but true connection is harder to find and express.

He has been making online comedy, web toys and massively shared experiences (like the addictive Young Me Now Me) ever since.","whylisten":"<p>Ever since his <a href=\"http://www.zefrank.com/invite/swfs/index2.html\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;How to Dance Properly&quot;</a> viral video -- born as a party invite for 17 friends -- hit the Web in 2001, Ze Frank has been making people giggle, guffaw and gasp out loud whilst procrastinating at work. He defines, in many ways, the genre of online comedy, and continues to innovate madly on the form.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2006 he launched a year-long daily video blog called <em><a href=\"http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/\" target=\"_blank\">The Show with Ze Frank</a></em>, which Slate.com called &quot;the best sustained comedy run in the history of the Web.&quot; His rapid-fire delivery and absurd explorations in audience participation (like Earth Sandwich) has influenced a generation of digital native YouTubers. Perhap his most brilliant move: calling on fans to write the show for him.  Using collaborative tools, online viewers collectively put words in his  mouth (and props in his lap); he faithfully performed this wiki-comedy  each week for his &quot;Fabuloso Friday&quot; show.</p><p>In 2008, along with Erik Kastner, Frank launched Colowars, the first massively multiplayer game on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zefrank\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, which featured two months of sponsored online events and competitions. Recently he has worked with his audience to create a series of projects based on shared emotions such as pain, fear and the pang of nostalgia. Frank works as a consultant to range of industries on audience engagement and is a public speaker on the subject of the virtual life. </p><p>In 2012 he returned to the internet airwaves with &quot;<a href=\"http://ashow.zefrank.com/\" target=\"_blank\">A Show</a>.&quot; About which a MetaFilter <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/114710/Thats-my-Cheese-Monster-talking#4285622\" target=\"_blank\">commenter</a>  wrote:</p><p>If this were a cult, I would join.<br /><br />If this were a religion, I would attend services.<br /><br />If this were a band, I would not torrent the albums, but buy them, full price, from a local independent record store.<br /><br />If this were a telethon, I would buy multiple tote bags.<br /><br />Welcome back, Ze. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Ze Frank","tags":["Internet","comedy","gaming","humanity","humor","music","play","technology","web"],"title":"My web playroom","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1946941}]}
