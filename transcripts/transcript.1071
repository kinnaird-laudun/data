											Yeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60,
											and I don&#39;t like being 60.
											(Laughter)
											And I started grappling
											with this existential angst
											of what little I had done with my life.
											It wasn&#39;t the resume
											of breaking this record here,
											it was more like, who had I become?
											How had I spent my valuable time?
											How could this have gone by
											like lightning?
											And I couldn&#39;t forgive myself
											for the countless, countless hours
											I had lost
											in negative thought —
											all the time I had spent beating myself up
											for losing my marriage
											and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid
											and career moves
											and this and this and this.
											Just why, why didn&#39;t I do it better? Why? Why? Why?
											And then my mother died at 82.
											And so I starting thinking,
											not only am I not happy with the past,
											now I&#39;m getting choked with,
											&quot;I&#39;ve only got 22 years left.&quot;
											What am I going to do with this short amount of time
											that&#39;s just fleeting?
											And I&#39;m not in the present whatsoever.

											And I decided the remedy to all this malaise
											was going to be
											for me to chase
											an elevated dream,
											an extreme dream,
											something that would require
											utter conviction
											and unwavering passion,
											something that would make me
											be my best self
											in every aspect of my life,
											every minute of every day,
											because the dream was so big
											that I couldn&#39;t get there
											without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction.
											And I decided,
											it was an old dream that was lingering,
											that was from so many years ago,
											three decades ago —
											the only sort of world class swim
											I had tried and failed at back in my 20s —
											was going from Cuba to Florida.
											It was deep in my imagination.

											No one&#39;s ever done it without a shark cage.
											It&#39;s daunting.
											It&#39;s more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean.
											It&#39;s probably, at my speed, at my age —
											for anybody&#39;s speed at anybody&#39;s age —
											going to take 60, maybe 70, hours
											of continuous swimming,
											never getting out on the boat.

											And I started to train.
											I hadn&#39;t swum for 31 years, not a stroke.
											And I had kept in good shape, but swimming&#39;s a whole different animal.
											As a matter of fact,
											this picture is supposed to be me during training.
											It&#39;s a smiling face.
											And when you&#39;re training for this sport, you are not smiling.
											(Laughter)
											It&#39;s an arduous, difficult sport,
											and I don&#39;t remember smiling
											at any time during this sport.
											As I said, I respect other sports,
											and I compare this sport sometimes
											to cycling and to mountain climbing
											and other of the expedition type events,
											but this is a sensory deprivation,
											a physical duress.
											And when I started in
											with the eight hours and the 10 hours and the 12 hours
											and the 14 hours and the 15 hours and the 24-hour swims,
											I knew I had it,
											because I was making it through these.

											And a month ago,

											I stood on that shore

											and I asked myself,
											do you have it?
											Are your shoulders ready?
											And they were. They were prepared.
											No stone left unturned.
											Was the mind ready?
											You know, you&#39;re swimming with the fogged goggles,

											so you&#39;re never really focused on anything, you don&#39;t see well.
											You&#39;ve got tight bathing caps over your ears

											because it&#39;s where the hypothermia starts,
											and so you don&#39;t hear very well.
											You&#39;re really left alone with your own thoughts.

											About the 50th hour,

											And we knew it, all 50 people on the boat,

											First of all, you&#39;re going to hit obstacles.

											But no, two hours in,
											wham! Never in my life ...
											I knew there were Portuguese men o&#39; war,
											all kinds of moon jellies, all kinds of things,
											but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans
											is not supposed to be in these waters.
											And I was on fire —
											excruciating, excruciating pain.
											I don&#39;t know if you can still see
											the red line here and up the arm.
											Evidently, a piece this big of tentacle
											has a hundred-thousand little barbs on it
											and each barb is not just stinging your skin,
											it&#39;s sending a venom.
											The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean
											is the box jellyfish.
											And every one of those barbs

											So first I feel like boiling hot oil,

											And I&#39;m yelling out, &quot;Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

											I don&#39;t like it, I didn&#39;t want to give into it,

In 1979, she stroked the then-longest swim in history, making the 102.5-mile journey from the island of Bimini (Bahamas) to Florida. She also broke numerous world records, including what had been a 50-year mark for circling Manhattan Island, setting the new time of 7 hrs 57 min. She is a member of the National Women&rsquo;s Hall of Fame and the International Swimming Hall of Fame.</p><p>At age 60, having not swum a stroke in decades, she began planning for her white whale of distance swims: the 110-mile ocean crossing between Cuba and Florida. She&#39;d tried it once, in her 20s, and severe jellyfish attacks had defeated her then. But now, with a strong team and a new commitment to her vision, she stepped back into the salt.
