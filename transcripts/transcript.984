											So I&#39;m a doctor, but I kind of slipped
sideways into research,
											and now I&#39;m an epidemiologist.
											And nobody really knows
what epidemiology is.
											Epidemiology is the science
of how we know in the real world
											if something is good
for you or bad for you.
											And it&#39;s best understood through example
											as the science of those crazy,
wacky newspaper headlines.
											And these are just some of the examples.

											These are from the Daily Mail.
											Every country in the world
has a newspaper like this.
											It has this bizarre,
ongoing philosophical project
											of dividing all the inanimate
objects in the world
											into the ones that either cause
or prevent cancer.
											Here are some of the things
they said cause cancer:
											divorce, Wi-Fi, toiletries and coffee.
											Some things they say prevent cancer:
											crusts, red pepper, licorice and coffee.
											So you can see there are contradictions.
											Coffee both causes and prevents cancer.
											As you start to read on, you can see
											that maybe there&#39;s some
political valence behind some of this.
											For women, housework
prevents breast cancer,
											but for men, shopping
could make you impotent.

											So we know that we need to start
unpicking the science behind this.
											And what I hope to show is that unpicking
the evidence behind dodgy claims
											isn&#39;t a kind of nasty, carping activity;
											it&#39;s socially useful.
											But it&#39;s also an extremely valuable
explanatory tool,
											because real science is about
critically appraising the evidence
											for somebody else&#39;s position.
											That&#39;s what happens in academic journals,
											it&#39;s what happens
at academic conferences —
											the Q&amp;A session after a postdoc
presents data is often a bloodbath.
											And nobody minds that;
we actively welcome it.
											It&#39;s like a consenting
intellectual S&amp;M activity.

											We&#39;ll start with the absolute weakest
form of evidence known to man,
											and that is authority.
											In science, we don&#39;t care how many letters
you have after your name —

											Next, we need proper science,
proper evidence.
											So: &quot;Red wine can help
prevent breast cancer.&quot;
											This is a headline
from The Daily Telegraph in the UK.
											&quot;A glass of red wine a day could help
prevent breast cancer.&quot;
											So you find this paper, and find
that it is a real piece of science.
											It&#39;s a description of the changes
in the behavior of one enzyme
											when you drip a chemical
extracted from some red grape skin

											in a dish on a bench
in a laboratory somewhere.
											And that&#39;s a really useful thing

risk of getting breast cancer

											it tells you absolutely bugger all.
											Actually, it turns out
that your risk of breast cancer

of alcohol you drink.
											So what we want are studies

											And here&#39;s another example.
											This is from Britain&#39;s &quot;leading&quot;
diet nutritionist in the Daily Mirror,
											our second-biggest selling newspaper.
											&quot;An Australian study in 2001
found that olive oil,
											in combination with fruits,

											offers measurable protection
against skin wrinklings,&quot;
											and give the advice:
											&quot;If you eat olive oil and vegetables,

											and what you find
is an observational study.
											Obviously, nobody has been able

											get all the people born
in one maternity unit,
											and half of them eat lots
of fruit and veg and olive oil,
											half of them eat McDonald&#39;s,

you&#39;ve got later.

											So ideally, what you want
to do is a trial.
											People think they&#39;re familiar
with the idea of a trial.
											Trials are old; the first one
was in the Bible, Daniel 1:12.
											It&#39;s straightforward: take a bunch
of people, split them in half,
											treat one group one way,
the other group, the other way.
											A while later, you see
what happened to each of them.
											I&#39;m going to tell you about one trial,
											which is probably
the most well-reported trial
											in the UK news media over the past decade.
											This is the trial of fish oil pills.
											The claim: fish oil pills improve
school performance and behavior
											in mainstream children.
											They said, &quot;We did a trial.
											All the previous ones were positive,
this one will be too.&quot;
											That should ring alarm bells:
											if you know the answer to your trial,
you shouldn&#39;t be doing one.
											Either you&#39;ve rigged it by design,
											or you&#39;ve got enough data so there&#39;s
no need to randomize people anymore.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So this is what they were going
to do in their trial:
											They were taking 3,000 children,
											they were going to give them these huge
fish oil pills, six of them a day,
											and then, a year later, measure
their school exam performance
											and compare their performance
											against what they predicted
their exam performance would have been
											if they hadn&#39;t had the pills.
											Now, can anybody spot
a flaw in this design?

											And no professors
of clinical trial methodology
											are allowed to answer this question.
											So there&#39;s no control group.

											The kids got the pills,

											What else could it possibly
be if it wasn&#39;t the pills?
											They got older; we all develop over time.
											And of course, there&#39;s the placebo effect,
											one of the most fascinating things
in the whole of medicine.
											It&#39;s not just taking a pill
and performance or pain improving;
											it&#39;s about our beliefs and expectations,
the cultural meaning of a treatment.
											And this has been demonstrated
in a whole raft of fascinating studies
											comparing one kind of placebo
against another.
											So we know, for example,
											that two sugar pills a day
are a more effective treatment
											for gastric ulcers
											than one sugar pill.
											Two sugar pills a day beats one a day.
											That&#39;s an outrageous
and ridiculous finding, but it&#39;s true.
											We know from three different studies
on three different types of pain
											that a saltwater injection
is a more effective treatment
											than a sugar pill, a dummy pill
with no medicine in it,
											not because the injection or pills
do anything physically to the body,
											but because an injection feels
like a much more dramatic intervention.
											So we know that our beliefs
and expectations can be manipulated,
											which is why we do trials
where we control against a placebo,
											where one half of the people
get the real treatment,
											and the other half get placebo.

											But that&#39;s not enough.
											What I&#39;ve just shown you are examples
											of the very simple
and straightforward ways
											that journalists and food supplement
pill peddlers and naturopaths
											can distort evidence
for their own purposes.
											What I find really fascinating
											is that the pharmaceutical industry
uses exactly the same kinds
											of tricks and devices,
											but slightly more sophisticated
versions of them,
											in order to distort the evidence
they give to doctors and patients,
											and which we use to make
vitally important decisions.

											So firstly, trials against placebo:
											everybody thinks a trial
should be a comparison
											of your new drug against placebo.
											But in a lot of situations that&#39;s wrong;
											often, we already have a good treatment
currently available.
											So we don&#39;t want to know
that your alternative new treatment
											is better than nothing,
											but that it&#39;s better than the best
available treatment we have.
											And yet, repeatedly, you consistently
see people doing trials
											still against placebo.
											And you can get licensed
to bring your drug to market
											with only data showing
that it&#39;s better than nothing,
											which is useless for a doctor like me
trying to make a decision.

									<p>
											But that&#39;s not the only way
you can rig your data.
											You can also rig your data
											by making the thing you compare
your new drug against
											really rubbish.
											You can give the competing drug
in too low a dose,
											so people aren&#39;t properly treated.
											You can give the competing drug
in too high a dose,
											so people get side effects.
											And this is exactly what happened
											with antipsychotic medication
for schizophrenia.
											Twenty years ago, a new generation
of antipsychotic drugs were brought in;
											the promise was they would have
fewer side effects.
											So people set about doing trials
of the new drugs against the old drugs.
											But they gave the old drugs
in ridiculously high doses:
											20 milligrams a day of haloperidol.
											And it&#39;s a foregone conclusion
if you give a drug at that high a dose,
											it will have more side effects,
and your new drug will look better.

									<p>
											Ten years ago, history repeated itself,
											when risperidone, the first
of the new-generation antipsychotic drugs,
											came off copyright,
so anybody could make copies.
											Everybody wanted to show their drug
was better than risperidone,
											so you see trials comparing
new antipsychotic drugs
											against risperidone
at eight milligrams a day.
											Again, not an insane dose,
not an illegal dose,
											but very much at the high end of normal.
											So you&#39;re bound to make
your new drug look better.
											And so it&#39;s no surprise that overall,
											industry-funded trials
are four times more likely
											to give a positive result
											than independently sponsored trials.

											How can we explain
this strange phenomenon?
											Well, it turns out that what happens
											is the negative data
goes missing in action;
											it&#39;s withheld from doctors and patients.
											And this is the most important
aspect of the whole story.
											It&#39;s at the top
of the pyramid of evidence.
											We need to have all of the data
on a particular treatment
											to know whether or not
it really is effective.
											There are two different ways you can spot
whether some data has gone missing.
											You can use statistics
or you can use stories.

											This is a funnel plot.
											A funnel plot is a very clever
way of spotting
											if small negative trials have disappeared,
have gone missing in action.
											This is a graph of all of the trials done
on a particular treatment.
											As you go up towards the top of the graph,
											what you see is each dot is a trial.
											As you go up, those are bigger trials,
so they&#39;ve got less error;
											they&#39;re less likely to be randomly false
positives or negatives.
											So they all cluster together.
											The big trials are closer
to the true answer.
											Then as you go further down at the bottom,
											what you can see is, on this side,
spurious false negatives,
											and over on this side,
spurious false positives.
											If there is publication bias,
											if small negative trials
have gone missing in action,
											you can see it on one of these graphs.
											So you see here
that the small negative trials
											that should be on the bottom left
have disappeared.
											This is a graph demonstrating
the presence of publication bias
											in studies of publication bias.
											And I think that&#39;s the funniest
epidemiology joke you will ever hear.

With that sentence Ben Goldacre fired the starting shot of a crusade waged from the pages of <em>The Guardian</em> from 2003 to 2011, on an addicitve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/bengoldacre\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>  feed, and in bestselling books, including <a href=\"http://geni.us/badscience\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bad Science</em></a> and his latest, <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/badpharma\" target=\"_blank\">Bad Pharma</a>, </em>which puts the $600 billion global pharmaceutical industry under the microscope. What he reveals is a fascinating, terrifying mess. <br /><br />Goldacre was trained in medicine at Oxford and London, and works as an academic in epidemiology. Helped along by this inexhaustible supply of material, he also travels the speaking circuit, promoting skepticism and nerdish curiosity with fire, wit, fast delivery and a lovable kind of exasperation. (He might even convince you that real science, sober reporting and reason are going to win in the end.) </p><p>As he writes, &quot;If you&#39;re a journalist who misrepresents science for the sake of a headline, a politician more interested in spin than evidence, or an advertiser who loves pictures of molecules in little white coats, then beware: your days are numbered.&quot;</p><p>Read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/21/drugs-industry-scandal-ben-goldacre\" target=\"_blank\">an excerpt of <em>Bad Pharma</em> &gt;&gt; </a> </p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/ben_goldacre_battling_bad_science","viewed_count":2319726,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"Every day there are news reports of new health advice, but how can you know if they're right?

With that sentence Ben Goldacre fired the starting shot of a crusade waged from the pages of <em>The Guardian</em> from 2003 to 2011, on an addicitve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/bengoldacre\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>  feed, and in bestselling books, including <a href=\"http://geni.us/badscience\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bad Science</em></a> and his latest, <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/badpharma\" target=\"_blank\">Bad Pharma</a>, </em>which puts the $600 billion global pharmaceutical industry under the microscope. What he reveals is a fascinating, terrifying mess. <br /><br />Goldacre was trained in medicine at Oxford and London, and works as an academic in epidemiology. Helped along by this inexhaustible supply of material, he also travels the speaking circuit, promoting skepticism and nerdish curiosity with fire, wit, fast delivery and a lovable kind of exasperation. (He might even convince you that real science, sober reporting and reason are going to win in the end.) </p><p>As he writes, &quot;If you&#39;re a journalist who misrepresents science for the sake of a headline, a politician more interested in spin than evidence, or an advertiser who loves pictures of molecules in little white coats, then beware: your days are numbered.&quot;</p><p>Read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/21/drugs-industry-scandal-ben-goldacre\" target=\"_blank\">an excerpt of <em>Bad Pharma</em> &gt;&gt; </a> </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Ben Goldacre","tags":["data","health care","illness","illusion","medicine","science","pharmaceuticals"],"title":"Battling bad science","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2319726}]}
