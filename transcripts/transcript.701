											JA: So these are — as far as we can tell —
											classical whistleblowers,
											and we have a number of ways for them
											to get information to us.
											So we use this state-of-the-art encryption
											to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails,
											pass it through legal jurisdictions
											like Sweden and Belgium
											to enact those legal protections.
											We get information in the mail,
											the regular postal mail,
											encrypted or not,
											vet it like a regular news organization, format it —
											which is sometimes something that&#39;s quite hard to do,
											when you&#39;re talking about
											giant databases of information —
											release it to the public
											and then defend ourselves
											against the inevitable legal and political attacks.

											JA: So this is the Kroll Report.
											This was a secret intelligence report
											commissioned by the Kenyan government
											after its election in 2004.
											Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled
											by Daniel arap Moi
											for about 18 years.
											He was a soft dictator of Kenya.
											And when Kibaki got into power —
											through a coalition of forces that were trying
											to clean up corruption in Kenya —
											they commissioned this report,
											spent about two million pounds
											on this and an associated report.
											And then the government sat on it
											and used it for political leverage on Moi,
											who was the richest man —
											still is the richest man — in Kenya.
											It&#39;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.
											So I went there in 2007,
											and we managed to get hold of this
											just prior to the election —
											the national election, December 28.
											When we released that report,
											we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki,
											had decided to pal up with
											the man that he was going to clean out,
											Daniel arap Moi,
											so this report then
											became a dead albatross
											around President Kibaki&#39;s neck.

											and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya,
											in Tanzanian and South African press.
											And so it came in from the outside.
											And that, after a couple of days,
											made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.
											And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV,
											shifted the vote by 10 percent,

											are spending economic effort into concealing,

											JA: So this is a sample of what we do
											sort of every day.
											So late last year — in November last year —
											there was a series of well blowouts
											in Albania,
											like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico,
											but not quite as big.
											And we got a report —
											a sort of engineering analysis into what happened —
											saying that, in fact, security guards
											from some rival, various competing oil firms
											had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.
											And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.
											And the engineering report
											had nothing on the top of it,
											so it was an extremely difficult document for us.
											We couldn&#39;t verify it because we didn&#39;t know
											who wrote it and knew what it was about.
											So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was
											a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.
											So under that basis, we put it out and said,
											&quot;Look, we&#39;re skeptical about this thing.
											We don&#39;t know, but what can we do?
											The material looks good, it feels right,
											but we just can&#39;t verify it.&quot;
											And we then got a letter
											just this week
											from the company who wrote it,
											wanting to track down the source —
											(Laughter)
											saying, &quot;Hey, we want to track down the source.&quot;
											And we were like, &quot;Oh, tell us more.
											What document is it, precisely, you&#39;re talking about?
											Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?
											Is it really yours?&quot;
											So they sent us this screen shot
											with the author
											in the Microsoft Word ID.
											Yeah.
											(Applause)
											That&#39;s happened quite a lot though.
											This is like one of our methods
											of identifying, of verifying, what a material is,

											CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story:
											what happened in Iceland?
											You basically published something there,
											ran into trouble with a bank,
											then the news service there
											was injuncted from running the story.
											Instead, they publicized your side.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.
											Iceland went through this financial crisis.
											It was the hardest hit of any country in the world.
											Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP
											of the rest of the economy.
											Anyway, so we release this report
											in July last year.
											And the national TV station was injuncted
											five minutes before it went on air,
											like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk,
											and the news reader was like,
											&quot;This has never happened before. What do we do?&quot;
											Well, we just show the website instead,
											for all that time, as a filler,
											and we became very famous in Iceland,
											went to Iceland and spoke about this issue.
											And there was a feeling in the community
											that that should never happen again,
											and as a result,
											working with Icelandic politicians
											and some other international legal experts,
											we put together a new sort of
											package of legislation for Iceland
											to sort of become an offshore haven
											for the free press,
											with the strongest journalistic protections in the world,
											with a new Nobel Prize
											for freedom of speech.
											Iceland&#39;s a Nordic country,
											so, like Norway, it&#39;s able to tap into the system.
											And just a month ago,
											this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.

											within the E.U.,
											between China and the United States.
											Which way is it going to go? It&#39;s hard to see.

in network security flaws for the far-more-suspect flaws of even bigger targets: governments and corporations. Since his early 20s, he has been using network technology to <strong>prod and probe the vulnerable edges of administrative systems</strong>, but though he was a computing hobbyist first (in 1991 he was the target of hacking charges after he accessed the computers of an Australian telecom), he&#39;s now taken off his &quot;white hat&quot; and launched a career as one of the world&#39;s most visible human-rights activists.</p><p>He calls himself &quot;editor in chief.&quot; He travels the globe as its spokesperson. Yet Assange&#39;s part in WikiLeaks is clearly dicier than that: he&#39;s become the face of creature that, simply, <strong>many powerful organizations would rather see the world rid of</strong>. His Wikipedia entry says he is &quot;constantly on the move,&quot; and <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-11/daniel-ellsberg-wikileaks-julian-assange-in-danger/\" target=\"_blank\">some speculate</a>  that his role in publishing <a href=\"http://www.collateralmurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">decrypted US military video</a>  has put him in personal danger. A controversial figure, pundits debate whether his work is reckless and does more harm than good. Amnesty International recognized him with an International Media Award in 2009.<br /><br />Assange studied physics and mathematics at the University of Melbourne. He wrote Strobe, the first free and open-source port scanner, and contributed to the book&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/underground\" target=\"_blank\">Underground: Tales of Hacking, Madness and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier</a>.</em></p>"}],"speaker_name":"Julian Assange","tags":["communication","global issues","iraq","military","news","technology","surveillance"],"title":"Why the world needs WikiLeaks","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2321949}]}
