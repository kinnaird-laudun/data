<meta content='"What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?" asks Regina Dugan, then director of DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In this breathtaking talk she describes some of the extraordinary projects — a robotic hummingbird, a prosthetic arm controlled by thought, and, well, the internet — that her agency has created by not worrying that they might fail.

											You should be nice
											to nerds.
											In fact, I&#39;d go so far as to say,
											if you don&#39;t already have a nerd in your life,
											you should get one.
											I&#39;m just saying.
											Scientists and engineers
											change the world.
											I&#39;d like to tell you
											about a magical place called DARPA
											where scientists and engineers
											defy the impossible
											and refuse to fear failure.
											Now these two ideas
											are connected more than you may realize,
											because when you remove the fear of failure,
											impossible things
											suddenly become possible.

											If you want to know how,
											ask yourself this question:
											What would you attempt to do
											if you knew you could not fail?
											If you really ask yourself
											this question,
											you can&#39;t help but feel uncomfortable.
											I feel a little uncomfortable.
											Because when you ask it,
											you begin to understand
											how the fear of failure constrains you,
											how it keeps us
											from attempting great things,
											and life gets dull,
											amazing things stop happening.
											Sure, good things happen,
											but amazing things
											stop happening.

											Now I should be clear,
											I&#39;m not encouraging failure,
											I&#39;m discouraging
											fear of failure.
											Because it&#39;s not failure itself
											that constrains us.
											The path to truly new,
											never-been-done-before things
											always has failure along the way.
											We&#39;re tested.
											And in part, that testing feels an appropriate part
											of achieving something great.
											Clemenceau said,
											&quot;Life gets interesting when we fail,
											because it&#39;s a sign
											that we&#39;ve surpassed ourselves.&quot;

											In 1895,
											Lord Kelvin declared
											that heavier-than-air flying machines
											were impossible.
											In October of 1903,
											the prevailing opinion
											of expert aerodynamicists
											was that maybe in 10 million years
											we could build an aircraft that would fly.
											And two months later on December 17th,
											Orville Wright powered the first airplane
											across a beach in North Carolina.
											The flight lasted 12 seconds
											and covered 120 feet.
											That was 1903.

											One year later,
											the next declarations of impossibilities began.
											Ferdinand Foch, a French army general
											credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds
											in the French army,
											said, &quot;Airplanes are interesting toys,
											but of no military value.&quot;
											40 years later,
											aero experts coined the term transonic.
											They debated, should it have one S or two?
											You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime,
											and it wasn&#39;t at all clear
											that we could fly faster than the speed of sound.
											In 1947,
											there was no wind tunnel data
											beyond Mach 0.85.
											And yet,
											on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947,
											Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit
											of his Bell X-1
											and he flew
											towards an unknown possibility,
											and in so doing,
											he became the first pilot
											to fly faster than the speed of sound.
											Six of eight Atlas rockets
											blew up on the pad.
											After 11 complete mission failures,
											we got our first images from space.
											And on that first flight
											we got more data
											than in all U-2 missions combined.
											It took a lot of failures
											to get there.

											Since we took to the sky,
											we have wanted to fly
											faster and farther.
											And to do so,
											we&#39;ve had to believe in impossible things.
											And we&#39;ve had to refuse
											to fear failure.
											That&#39;s still true today.
											Today, we don&#39;t talk about flying transonically,
											or even supersonically,
											we talk about flying hypersonically —
											not Mach 2 or Mach 3, Mach 20.
											At Mach 20,
											we can fly from New York to Long Beach
