											My mother wanted me to be a dentist.
											But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.
											So I actually went to school in Belfast,
											which was where all the action happened.
											And this was a pretty common sight.
											The school I went to was pretty boring.
											They forced us to learn things like Latin.
											The school teachers weren&#39;t having much fun,
											the sports were very dirty or very painful.
											So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.

											So this was extremely embarrassing.
											But our school at that time got a grant from the government,
											and they got an incredible computer — the research machine 3DZ —
											and they left the programming manuals lying around.
											And so students like myself with nothing to do,
											we would learn how to program it.
											Also around this time, at home,
											this was the computer that people were buying.
											It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,

											so we could really take control of the hardware.

											The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.

											Last year was the biggest year.
											By 2008, we&#39;re going to kick the butt of the music industry.

											And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.
											So 37 is our target audience.
											All video games are violent.

											What I have only recently come to realize
											is that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion
											it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating
											and addictive to me.
											I know that I am losing my grip.
											Part of me is just waiting to let go.
											I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,
											or how flat the real world may seem to us,
											that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us
											and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.

											I found that video very, very thought provoking,
											and that&#39;s why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.
											And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice
											for me to talk about was graphics and audio.
											But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.
											Video games give an awful lot of other things too,
											and that&#39;s why people get so addicted.
											The most important one being fun.

											The name of this track is &quot;The Magic To Come.&quot;
											Who is that going to come from?
											Is it going to come from the best directors in the world

											I don&#39;t think so.
											I think it&#39;s going to come from the children who are growing up now
											that aren&#39;t stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.
											They&#39;re going to do it their way, using the tools that we&#39;ve created.

											As far as colleges go, there&#39;s about 350 colleges around the world
											teaching video game courses.
											That means there&#39;s literally thousands of new ideas.
											Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.
											There&#39;s nothing worse than having to listen to someone
											try and pitch you a really bad video game idea.

											DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.

											This is my daughter, her name&#39;s Emma, she&#39;s 17 months old.
											And I&#39;ve been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience
											in the video game world?
											And as I&#39;ve shown here, we have the audience.
											She&#39;s never going to know a world where you can&#39;t press a button
											and have millions of people ready to play.
											You know, we have the technology.
											She&#39;s never going to know a world where the graphics just aren&#39;t
											stunning and really immersive.
											And as the student video showed, we can impact and move.
											She&#39;s never going to know a world where video games
											aren&#39;t incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.
											I just hope she likes video games.

											So, my closing thought.
											Games on the surface seem simple entertainment,
											but for those that like to look a little deeper,
											the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers
											to creative minds that like to think big.
											Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED?
