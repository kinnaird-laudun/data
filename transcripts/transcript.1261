											The story starts:
I was at a friend&#39;s house,
											and she had on her shelf
a copy of the DSM manual,
											which is the manual of mental disorders.
											It lists every known mental disorder.
											And it used to be, back in the &#39;50s,
a very slim pamphlet.
											And then it got bigger
and bigger and bigger,
											and now it&#39;s 886 pages long.
											And it lists currently
374 mental disorders.

											Anyway, I was looking through this book,
											wondering if I was much crazier
than I thought I was,
											or maybe it&#39;s not a good idea to diagnose
yourself with a mental disorder
											if you&#39;re not a trained professional,
											or maybe the psychiatry profession
has a kind of strange desire
											to label what&#39;s essentially normal
human behavior as a mental disorder.
											I didn&#39;t know which of these was true,
but I thought it was kind of interesting,
											and I thought maybe I should
meet a critic of psychiatry
											to get their view,
											which is how I ended up having
lunch with the Scientologists.

											It was a man called Brian,
who runs a crack team of Scientologists
											who are determined to destroy
psychiatry wherever it lies.
											They&#39;re called the CCHR.
											And I said to him, &quot;Can you prove to me

that can&#39;t be trusted?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;Yes,
we can prove it to you.&quot;

											And I said, &quot;Who&#39;s Tony?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;Tony&#39;s in Broadmoor.&quot;
											Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.
											It used to be known as the Broadmoor
Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
											It&#39;s where they send the serial killers,
											and the people who can&#39;t help themselves.
											And I said to Brian,
&quot;Well, what did Tony do?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;Hardly anything.
											He beat someone up or something,
											and he decided to fake madness
to get out of a prison sentence.
											But he faked it too well,
and now he&#39;s stuck in Broadmoor
											and nobody will believe he&#39;s sane.
											Do you want us to try and get you
into Broadmoor to meet Tony?&quot;

											So I got the train to Broadmoor.
											I began to yawn uncontrollably
around Kempton Park,
											which apparently is what dogs
also do when anxious,
											they yawn uncontrollably.
											And we got to Broadmoor.
											And I got taken through gate
after gate after gate after gate
											into the wellness center, which is where
you get to meet the patients.
											It looks like a giant Hampton Inn.
											It&#39;s all peach and pine
and calming colors.
											And the only bold colors
are the reds of the panic buttons.
											And the patients started drifting in.
											And they were quite overweight
and wearing sweatpants,
											and quite docile-looking.
											And Brian the Scientologist
whispered to me,
											&quot;They&#39;re medicated,&quot;
											which, to the Scientologists,
is like the worst evil in the world,
											but I&#39;m thinking
it&#39;s probably a good idea.

I told the psychiatrist

											And when I got home I emailed
his clinician, Anthony Maden.
											I said, &quot;What&#39;s the story?&quot;

We accept that Tony faked madness
											to get out of a prison sentence,
because his hallucinations —
											that had seemed
quite cliche to begin with —
											just vanished the minute
he got to Broadmoor.
											However, we have assessed him,
											and we&#39;ve determined that what he is
											is a psychopath.&quot;
											And in fact, faking madness
											is exactly the kind of cunning
and manipulative act of a psychopath.
											It&#39;s on the checklist:
cunning, manipulative.
											So, faking your brain going wrong
											is evidence that your brain
has gone wrong.
											And I spoke to other experts,
											and they said the pinstripe
suit — classic psychopath —
											speaks to items one
and two on the checklist:
											glibness, superficial charm
and grandiose sense of self-worth.
											And I said, &quot;Well, but why didn&#39;t
he hang out with the other patients?&quot;
											Classic psychopath — it speaks
to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.
											So all the things that had seemed
most normal about Tony
											was evidence, according to his clinician,
											that he was mad in this new way.
											He was a psychopath.

											Hare said the reason why

of psychopathy.

that was kind of normal —

											he said he got accepted into West Point,

delinquents in West Point.
											He said &quot;no&quot; to many short-term
marital relationships.
											He&#39;s only ever been married twice.
											Admittedly, his first wife
cited in her divorce papers
											that he once threatened her with a knife
											and said he always wondered
what human flesh tasted like,
											but people say stupid things to each other
											in bad marriages
in the heat of an argument,
											and his second marriage
has lasted 41 years.
											So whenever he said anything to me
that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,
											I thought to myself, well I&#39;m not
going to put that in my book.
											And then I realized that
becoming a psychopath spotter
											had kind of turned me
a little bit psychopathic.
											Because I was desperate to shove him
in a box marked &quot;Psychopath.&quot;
											I was desperate to define him

											and we wait for the gems.
											And the gems are always
the outermost aspects
											of our interviewee&#39;s personality.
											And we stitch them together
like medieval monks,
											and we leave the normal
stuff on the floor.
											And you know, this is a country
that over-diagnoses
											certain mental disorders hugely.
											Childhood bipolar —
											children as young as four
are being labeled bipolar
											because they have temper tantrums,
											which scores them high
on the bipolar checklist.

											When I got back to London, Tony phoned me.
											He said, &quot;Why haven&#39;t you
been returning my calls?&quot;
											I said, &quot;Well, they say
that you&#39;re a psychopath.&quot;
											And he said, &quot;I&#39;m not a psychopath.&quot;
											He said, &quot;You know what?
											One of the items on the checklist
is lack of remorse,
											but another item on the checklist
is cunning, manipulative.
											So when you say you feel
remorse for your crime,
											they say, &#39;Typical of the psychopath
											to cunningly say he feels
remorse when he doesn&#39;t.&#39;
											It&#39;s like witchcraft, they turn
everything upside-down.&quot;
											He said, &quot;I&#39;ve got a tribunal coming up.
											Will you come to it?&quot;
											So I said okay.

											So I went to his tribunal.
											And after 14 years
in Broadmoor, they let him go.
											They decided that he shouldn&#39;t
be held indefinitely
											because he scores high
on a checklist that might mean
											that he would have a greater
than average chance of recidivism.
											So they let him go.
											And outside in the corridor he said to me,
											&quot;You know what, Jon?
											Everyone&#39;s a bit psychopathic.&quot;
											He said, &quot;You are, I am.
Well, obviously I am.&quot;
											I said, &quot;What are you going to do now?&quot;
											He said, &quot;I&#39;m going to go to Belgium.
											There&#39;s a woman there that I fancy.
											But she&#39;s married, so I&#39;m going to have
to get her split up from her husband.&quot;

											Anyway, that was two years ago,
											and that&#39;s where my book ended.
											And for the last 20 months,
everything was fine.
											Nothing bad happened.
											He was living with a girl outside London.
											He was, according
to Brian the Scientologist,
											making up for lost time,
which I know sounds ominous,
											but isn&#39;t necessarily ominous.
											Unfortunately, after 20 months,
											he did go back to jail for a month.
											He got into a &quot;fracas&quot;
in a bar, he called it.
											Ended up going to jail for a month,
which I know is bad,
											but at least a month implies
that whatever the fracas was,
											it wasn&#39;t too bad.

											And then he phoned me.
											And you know what, I think
it&#39;s right that Tony is out.
											Because you shouldn&#39;t define
people by their maddest edges.
											And what Tony is,
is he&#39;s a semi-psychopath.
											He&#39;s a gray area in a world
that doesn&#39;t like gray areas.
											But the gray areas
are where you find the complexity.
											It&#39;s where you find the humanity,
											and it&#39;s where you find the truth.
											And Tony said to me,
											&quot;Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?
											I just want to thank you
for everything you&#39;ve done for me.&quot;
											And I didn&#39;t go.
											What would you have done?

In his books, films and articles, Ronson explores madness and obsession of all kinds, from the US military&#39;s experiments in psychic warfare to the obscene and hate-filled yet Christian rap of the Insane Clown Posse. He wrote a column for the <em>Guardian</em>, hosted an essay program on Radio 4 in the United Kingdom, and contributes to <em>This American Life</em>.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jon Ronson","tags":["culture","mind","prison","storytelling"],"title":"Strange answers to the psychopath test","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":13015757}]}
