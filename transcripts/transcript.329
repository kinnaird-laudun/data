											I spent the better part of a decade
											looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide.
											And I&#39;d like to start by sharing with you one moment
											that to me sums up what there is to know
											about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity.
									</p>

											And that moment came on April 21, 1994.
											So 14 years ago, almost, in the middle of the Rwandan genocide,
											in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated
											by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia.
											On April 21, in the New York Times,
											the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people
											had already been killed in the genocide.
											It was in the paper — not on the front page.
											It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage,
											it was buried in the paper.
											Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy,
											and amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But on April 21, a wonderfully honest moment occurred.
											And that was that an American congresswoman
											named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado
											met with a group of journalists.
											And one of the journalists said to her, what&#39;s up?
											What&#39;s going on in the U.S. government?
											Two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated
											in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda.
											It&#39;s two weeks into the genocide at that time,
											but of course, at that time you don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s going to last.
											And the journalist said, why is there so little response out of Washington?
											Why no hearings, no denunciations,
											no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy
											or in front of the White House? What&#39;s the deal?
											And she said — she was so honest — she said, &quot;It&#39;s a great question.
											All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado
											and my office in Washington,
											we&#39;re getting hundreds and hundreds of calls
											about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda,
											but nobody is calling about the people.
											The phones just aren&#39;t ringing about the people.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And the reason I give you this moment is there&#39;s a deep truth in it.
											And that truth is, or was, in the 20th century,
											that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements, 

											we didn&#39;t have an endangered people&#39;s movement.
											We had Holocaust education in the schools.
											Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe,
											but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust.
											There&#39;s a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington,
											right next to Lincoln and Jefferson.
											I mean, we have owned Never Again culturally,
											appropriately, interestingly.
											And yet the politicization of Never Again,
											the operationalization of Never Again,
											had never occurred in the 20th century.

									<p>
											And that&#39;s what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows:
											that if we are to bring about an end to the world&#39;s worst atrocities,
											we have to make it such.
											There has to be a role —
											there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs
											in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.
											So that was the 20th century.

											Now here — and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon —
											there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century,
											and that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being
											an anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency,
											and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.
											It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur.
											It is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters
											on college campuses around the country.
											It&#39;s bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.
											There are something like 500 high school chapters
											devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur.
											Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.
											&quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement.

									<p>
											To call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading.
											It&#39;s diverse. It&#39;s got a lot of different approaches.
											It&#39;s got all the ups and the downs of movements.
											But it has been amazingly successful in one regard,
											in that it has become,
											it has congealed into this endangered people&#39;s movement
											that was missing in the 20th century.
											It sees itself, such as it is, the it,
											as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost,
											there will be a political price to be paid,
											for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination,
											for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander.

									<p>
											Now because it&#39;s student-driven,
											there&#39;s some amazing things that the movement has done.
											They have launched a divestment campaign
											that has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states
											to divest their holdings of stocks
											with regard to companies doing business in Sudan.
											They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number —
											this is going to sound very kitsch,
											but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical,
											but interested in doing something about genocide,
											you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code,
											and you don&#39;t even have to know who your congressperson is.
											It will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator,
											to your governor where divestment legislation is pending.
											They&#39;ve lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.
											I think the most innovative thing they&#39;ve introduced recently
											are genocide grades.
											And it takes students to introduce genocide grades.
											So what you now have when a Congress is in session
											is members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds
											and saying, I&#39;m just told I have a D minus on genocide;
											what do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me.
											And the students and the others
											who are part of this incredibly energized base
											are there to answer that, and there&#39;s always something to do.

											Now, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration
											from the United States,
											at a time of massive over-stretch — military, financial, diplomatic —
											a whole series of commitments to Darfur
											that no other country in the world is making.
											For instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur
											to the International Criminal Court,
											which the Bush administration doesn&#39;t like.
											The expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep,
											basically, the people who&#39;ve been displaced from their homes
											by the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia,
											to keep those people alive
											until something more durable can be achieved.

											The bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail,

											The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides

											Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid

											So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century,
											and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding
											as we sit here, as we speak.
											Why the limits to the movement?
											Why is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done,

											I think there are a couple — there are many reasons —
											but a couple just to focus on briefly.

											The first is that the movement, such as it is,

											stops at America&#39;s borders. 
It is not a global movement. 

											It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves
											are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.
											And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country
											makes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think,
											want to bring Never Again to life.
											The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed,
											that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda,
											created a space in our society for a consensus
											that Rwanda was bad and wrong
											and we wish we had done more, and that is something
											that the movement has taken advantage of.
											European governments, for the most part,

											So this movement, if it&#39;s to be durable and global,
											will have to cross borders, and you will have to see

											that their government would do something in the face of genocide,
											but actually making it such.
											Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude
											naturally or eagerly.
											As we saw, they haven&#39;t even gravitated towards protecting our ports
											or reigning in loose nukes.
											Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself
											towards distant suffering?
											So one reason is it hasn&#39;t gone global.

											The second is, of course, that at this time in particular in America&#39;s history,
											we have a credibility problem,
											a legitimacy problem in international institutions.
											It is structurally really, really hard to do,
											as the Bush administration rightly does,
											which is to denounce genocide on a Monday
											and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer
											and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments.
											Now, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved.
											Let me be clear.
											They&#39;re in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi.
											But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere,
											of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world.
											The recovery&#39;s going to take some time.

											that could come home to roost sometime in the future?
											The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man
											that many of you may not have ever heard of,
											and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who,
											as Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.
											He was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq.

											And in the U.N., you don&#39;t get that many people
											who actually manage to merge those qualities.
											He was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious.
											He was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames,
											he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie.
											He was successful with women.
											He was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell
											if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist
											or an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered
											about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way.

											What he was was a decathlete of nation-building, of problem-solving,

											In failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states,
											precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist
											on the horizon, and precisely the kinds of places
											where most of the world&#39;s suffering tends to get concentrated.
											These are the places he was drawn to.
											He moved with the headlines.
											He was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21.
											Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the &#39;70s
											were wars of independence and decolonization.
											He was there in Bangladesh
											dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees —

											Here&#39;s this guy who got a 34-year head start
											thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with,
											we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?

									<p>
											First, I think, is his relationship to, in fact, evil is something to learn from.
											He, over the course of his career, changed a great deal.
											He had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive.
											I think that was his greatest quality.
											He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers,
											he would charge up to people who were violating international law,
											and he would say, you&#39;re violating, this is the U.N. Charter.
											Don&#39;t you see it&#39;s unacceptable what you&#39;re doing?
											And they would laugh at him because he didn&#39;t have the power of states,
											the power of any military or police.
											He just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them.
											And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in &#39;82,
											he said to himself and to everybody else,
											I will never use the word &quot;unacceptable&quot; again.
											I will never use it. I will try to make it such,
											but I will never use that word again.
											But he lunged in the opposite direction.
											He started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil,
											to not denounce, and became almost obsequious
											when he won the nickname Serbio, for instance,
											and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge
											would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But by the end of his life, I think he had struck a balance
											that we as a country can learn from.
											Be in the room, don&#39;t be afraid of talking to your adversaries,
											but don&#39;t bracket what happened before you entered the room.
											Don&#39;t black-box history. Don&#39;t check your principles at the door.
											And I think that&#39;s something that we have to be in the room,
											whether it&#39;s Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy
											or Reagan and Gorbachev.
											All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries
											has come by going into the room.
											And it doesn&#39;t have to be an act of weakness.
											You can actually do far more to build an international coalition
											against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room
											and showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime,
											is the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem.

											Second take-away from Sergio&#39;s life, briefly.
											What I take away, and this in some ways is the most important,
											he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity
											that was really, really unusual.
											At a micro level, the individuals around him were visible.
											He saw them.
											At a macro level, he thought, you know,
											we talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes
											that&#39;s an affront to people&#39;s dignity.
											We put people on humanitarian aid
											and we boast about it because we&#39;ve spent three billion.
											It&#39;s incredibly important,
											those people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance,
											hadn&#39;t spent that money in Darfur,
											but it&#39;s not a way to live.
											If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens
											and as individuals with relation to the people around us,
											and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity
											into our dealings with other countries,
											it would be something of a revolution.

									<p>
											Third point, very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear.
											And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of.
											There are so many genuine threats in the world.
											But what Sergio was talking about is,
											let&#39;s calibrate our relationship to the threat.
											Let&#39;s not hype the threat; let&#39;s actually see it clearly.
											We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps.
											We have reason to be afraid that we haven&#39;t secured
											loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.
											Let&#39;s focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats,
											but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.
											In times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say
											is, fear is a bad advisor.
											We lunge towards the extremes
											when we aren&#39;t operating and trying to, again,
											calibrate our relationship to the world around us.

											Fourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working
											in all the world&#39;s worst places and all lesser evils,
											had a humility, of course,
											and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.
											I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.
											How Sisyphean this task was of mending,
											and yet aware of that complexity, 

											humbled by it, he wasn&#39;t paralyzed by it.
											And we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of,
											the crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy,
											I think there&#39;s a temptation to pull back from the world and say,
											ah, Katrina, Iraq — we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing.

											And the lesson, I think,
											of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned,
											that is a partial success but by no means
											has it achieved what it has set out to do —
											it&#39;ll be many decades, probably, before that happens —
											but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.
											We can&#39;t rely upon our institutions to do the work
											of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own
											without us creating a space for that to happen,
											for having respect for dignity,
											and for bringing that combination of humility
											and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility
											to our dealings with the rest of the world.
											So will evil prevail? Is that the question?
