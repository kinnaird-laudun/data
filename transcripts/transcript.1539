<title>Michael Porter: The case for letting business solve social problems | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why do we turn to nonprofits, NGOs and governments to solve society&#39;s biggest problems? Michael Porter admits he&#39;s biased, as a business school professor, but he wants you to hear his case for letting business try to solve massive problems like climate change and access to water. Why? Because when business solves a problem, it makes a profit -- which lets that solution grow." />

<meta content="Why do we turn to nonprofits, NGOs and governments to solve society's biggest problems? Michael Porter admits he's biased, as a business school professor, but he wants you to hear his case for letting business try to solve massive problems like climate change and access to water. Why? Because when business solves a problem, it makes a profit — which lets that solution grow." itemprop='description'>

											I think we&#39;re all aware
											that the world today is full of problems.
											We&#39;ve been hearing them
											today and yesterday and every day for decades.
											Serious problems, big problems, pressing problems.
											Poor nutrition, access to water,
											climate change, deforestation,
											lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food,
											not enough healthcare, pollution.
											There&#39;s problem after problem,
											and I think what really separates this time
											from any time I can remember in my brief time
											on Earth is the awareness of these problems.
											We&#39;re all very aware.

									<p>
											Why are we having so much trouble
											dealing with these problems?
											That&#39;s the question I&#39;ve been struggling with,
											coming from my very different perspective.
											I&#39;m not a social problem guy.
											I&#39;m a guy that works with business,
											helps business make money.
											God forbid.
											So why are we having so many problems
											with these social problems,
											and really is there any role for business,
											and if so, what is that role?
											I think that in order to address that question,
											we have to step back and think about
											how we&#39;ve understood and pondered
											both the problems and the solutions
											to these great social challenges that we face.

											Now, I think many have seen business
											as the problem, or at least one of the problems,
											in many of the social challenges we face.
											You know, think of the fast food industry,
											the drug industry, the banking industry.
											You know, this is a low point
											in the respect for business.
											Business is not seen as the solution.
											It&#39;s seen as the problem now, for most people.
											And rightly so, in many cases.
											There&#39;s a lot of bad actors out there
											that have done the wrong thing,
											that actually have made the problem worse.
											So this perspective is perhaps justified.

											How have we tended to see the solutions
											to these social problems,
											these many issues that we face in society?
											Well, we&#39;ve tended to see the solutions
											in terms of NGOs,
											in terms of government,
											in terms of philanthropy.
											Indeed, the kind of unique organizational entity
											of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs
											and social organizations.
											This is a unique, new organizational form
											that we&#39;ve seen grown up.
											Enormous innovation, enormous energy,
											enormous talent now has been mobilized
											through this structure
											to try to deal with all of these challenges.
											And many of us here are deeply involved in that.

											I&#39;m a business school professor,
											but I&#39;ve actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits.
											Whenever I got interested and became aware
											of a societal problem, that was what I did,
											form a nonprofit.
											That was the way we&#39;ve thought about how to deal
											with these issues.
											Even a business school professor has thought about it that way.

											and there&#39;s an awkward reality.
											The awkward reality is we&#39;re not making
											fast enough progress.
											We&#39;re not winning.
											These problems still seem very daunting
											and very intractable,
											and any solutions we&#39;re achieving
											are small solutions.
											We&#39;re making incremental progress.

											What&#39;s the fundamental problem we have
											in dealing with these social problems?
											If we cut all the complexity away,
											we have the problem of scale.
											We can&#39;t scale.
											We can make progress. We can show benefits.
											We can show results. We can make things better.
											We&#39;re helping. We&#39;re doing better. We&#39;re doing good.
											We can&#39;t scale.
											We can&#39;t make a large-scale impact on these problems.
											Why is that?
											Because we don&#39;t have the resources.
											And that&#39;s really clear now.
											And that&#39;s clearer now than it&#39;s been for decades.
											There&#39;s simply not enough money
											to deal with any of these problems at scale
											using the current model.
											There&#39;s not enough tax revenue,
											there&#39;s not enough philanthropic donations,
											to deal with these problems the way we&#39;re dealing with them now.
											We&#39;ve got to confront that reality.
											And the scarcity of resources
											for dealing with these problems is only growing,
											certainly in the advanced world today,
											with all the fiscal problems we face.

											So if it&#39;s fundamentally a resource problem,
											where are the resources in society?
											How are those resources really created,
											the resources we&#39;re going to need to deal
											with all these societal challenges?
											Well there, I think the answer is very clear:
											They&#39;re in business.
											All wealth is actually created by business.
											Business creates wealth
											when it meets needs at a profit.
											That&#39;s how all wealth is created.
											It&#39;s meeting needs at a profit
											that leads to taxes
											and that leads to incomes
											and that leads to charitable donations.
											That&#39;s where all the resources come from.
											Only business can actually create resources.
											Other institutions can utilize them
											to do important work,
											but only business can create them.
											And business creates them
											when it&#39;s able to meet a need at a profit.
											The resources are overwhelmingly
											generated by business.
											The question then is, how do we tap into this?
											How do we tap into this?
											Business generates those resources
											when it makes a profit.
											That profit is that small difference
											between the price and the cost it takes to produce
											whatever solution business has created
											to whatever problem they&#39;re trying to solve.
											But that profit is the magic.
											Why? Because that profit allows whatever solution
											we&#39;ve created
											to be infinitely scalable.
											Because if we can make a profit,
											we can do it for 10, 100, a million,
											100 million, a billion.
											The solution becomes self-sustaining.
											That&#39;s what business does
											when it makes a profit.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now what does this all have to do
											with social problems?
											Well, one line of thinking is, let&#39;s take this profit
											and redeploy it into social problems.
											Business should give more.
											Business should be more responsible.
											And that&#39;s been the path that we&#39;ve been on
											in business.
											But again, this path that we&#39;ve been on
											is not getting us where we need to go.

											Now, I started out as a strategy professor,
											and I&#39;m still a strategy professor.
											I&#39;m proud of that.
											But I&#39;ve also, over the years,
											worked more and more on social issues.
											I&#39;ve worked on healthcare, the environment,
											economic development, reducing poverty,
											and as I worked more and more in the social field,
											I started seeing something
											that had a profound impact on me
											and my whole life, in a way.

									<p>
											The conventional wisdom in economics
											and the view in business has historically been
											that actually, there&#39;s a tradeoff
											between social performance and economic performance.
											The conventional wisdom has been
											that business actually makes a profit
											by causing a social problem.
											The classic example is pollution.
											If business pollutes, it makes more money
											than if it tried to reduce that pollution.
											Reducing pollution is expensive,
											therefore businesses don&#39;t want to do it.
											It&#39;s profitable to have an unsafe working environment.
											It&#39;s too expensive to have a safe working environment,
											therefore business makes more money
											if they don&#39;t have a safe working environment.
											That&#39;s been the conventional wisdom.
											A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom.
											They resisted environmental improvement.
											They resisted workplace improvement.
											That thinking has led to, I think,
											much of the behavior
											that we have come to criticize in business,
											that I come to criticize in business.

											But the more deeply I got into all these social issues,
											one after another,
											and actually, the more I tried to address them
											myself, personally, in a few cases,
											through nonprofits that I was involved with,
											the more I found actually that the reality
											is the opposite.
											Business does not profit
											from causing social problems,
											actually not in any fundamental sense.
											That&#39;s a very simplistic view.
											The deeper we get into these issues,
											the more we start to understand
											that actually business profits
											from solving from social problems.
											That&#39;s where the real profit comes.
											Let&#39;s take pollution.
											We&#39;ve learned today that actually
											reducing pollution and emissions
											is generating profit.
											It saves money.
											It makes the business more productive and efficient.
											It doesn&#39;t waste resources.
											Having a safer working environment actually,
											and avoiding accidents,
											it makes the business more profitable,
											because it&#39;s a sign of good processes.
											Accidents are expensive and costly.
											Issue by issue by issue, we start to learn
											that actually there&#39;s no trade-off
											between social progress
											and economic efficiency
											in any fundamental sense.
											Another issue is health.
											I mean, what we&#39;ve found is actually
											health of employees is something
											that business should treasure,
											because that health allows those employees
											to be more productive and come to work
											and not be absent.
											The deeper work, the new work, the new thinking
											on the interface between business and social problems
											is actually showing that there&#39;s a fundamental,
											deep synergy,
											particularly if you&#39;re not thinking in the very short run.
											In the very short run, you can sometimes
											fool yourself into thinking
											that there&#39;s fundamentally opposing goals,
											but in the long run, ultimately, we&#39;re learning
											in field after field that this is simply not true.

											So how could we tap into

											we could scale.
											We could tap into this enormous resource pool

											And guess what? That&#39;s happening now, finally,
											partly because of people like you
											who have raised these issues now
											for year after year and decade after decade.
											We see organizations like Dow Chemical
											leading the revolution away from trans fat
											and saturated fat with innovative new products.
											This is an example of Jain Irrigation.
											This is a company that&#39;s brought drip irrigation technology
											to thousands and millions of farmers,
											reducing substantially the use of water.
											We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria
											that&#39;s figured out how to avoid
											tearing down old growth forest
											and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield
											per hectare of pulp
											and making much more paper than you could make
											by cutting down those old trees.
											You see companies like Cisco that are training
											so far four million people in I.T. skills
											to actually, yes, be responsible,
											but help expand the opportunity
											to disseminate I.T. technology
											and grow the whole business.
											There&#39;s a fundamental opportunity for business today
											to impact and address these social problems,
											and this opportunity
											is the largest business opportunity
											we see in business.

									<p>
											And the question is, how can we get business
											thinking to adapt this issue of shared value?
											This is what I call shared value:
											addressing a social issue with a business model.
											That&#39;s shared value.
											Shared value is capitalism,
											but it&#39;s a higher kind of capitalism.
											It&#39;s capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be,
											meeting important needs,
											not incrementally competing for
											trivial differences in product attributes
											and market share.
											Shared value is when we can create social value
											and economic value simultaneously.
											It&#39;s finding those opportunities
											that will unleash the greatest possibility we have
											to actually address these social problems
											because we can scale.
											We can address shared value at multiple levels.
											It&#39;s real. It&#39;s happening.

									<p>
											But in order to get this solution working,
											we have to now change how business sees itself,
											and this is thankfully underway.
											Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom
											that they shouldn&#39;t worry about social problems,
											that this was sort of something on the side,
											that somebody else was doing it.
											We&#39;re now seeing companies
											embrace this idea.
											But we also have to recognize business
											is not going to do this as effectively
											as if we have NGOs and government
											working in partnership with business.
											The new NGOs that are really moving the needle
											are the ones that have found these partnerships,
											that have found these ways to collaborate.
											The governments that are making the most progress
											are the governments that have found ways
											to enable shared value in business
											rather than see government as the only player
											that has to call the shots.
											And government has many ways in which it could impact
											the willingness and the ability of companies
											to compete in this way.

											I think if we can get business seeing itself differently,

											we can change the world.
											I know it. I&#39;m seeing it.
											I&#39;m feeling it.
											Young people, I think,
											my Harvard Business School students, are getting it.
											If we can break down this sort of divide,

											this sense that we&#39;re not
											fundamentally collaborating here
											in driving these social problems,
											we can break this down,

Now he&#39;s taking on a massive question: the perceived disconnect between corporations and society. He argues that companies must begin to take the lead in reconceiving the intersection between society and corporate interests -- and he suggests a framework, that of &quot;<a href=\"http://hbr.org/2011/01/the-big-idea-creating-shared-value\" target=\"_blank\">shared value</a>,&quot; which involves creating economic value in a way that also creates value for society.<br />&nbsp;<br />Porter is a University Professor at Harvard Business School, where he leads the Institute on Strategy and Competitiveness, studying competitiveness for companies and nations -- and as a solution to social problems.
