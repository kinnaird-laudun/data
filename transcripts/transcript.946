											The question today is not:
											Why did we invade Afghanistan?
											The question is:
											why are we still in Afghanistan
											one decade later?
											Why are we spending
											$135 billion?
											Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?
											Why were more people killed
											last month
											than in any preceding month
											of this conflict?
											How has this happened?
											The last 20 years
											has been the age of intervention,
											and Afghanistan is simply one act
											in a five-act tragedy.
											We came out of the end of the Cold War
											in despair.
											We faced Rwanda;
											we faced Bosnia,
											and then we rediscovered our confidence.
											In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo
											and we seemed to succeed.
											In the fourth act, with our hubris,
											our overconfidence developing,
											we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan,
											and in the fifth act,
											we plunged into a humiliating mess.

											So the question is: What are we doing?
											Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan?
											And the answer, of course,
											that we keep being given
											is as follows:
											we&#39;re told that we went into Afghanistan
											because of 9/11,
											and that we remain there
											because the Taliban poses an existential threat
											to global security.
											In the words of President Obama,
											&quot;If the Taliban take over again,
											they will invite back Al-Qaeda,
											who will try to kill as many of our people
											as they possibly can.&quot;
											The story that we&#39;re told
											is that there was a &quot;light footprint&quot; initially —
											in other words, that we ended up in a situation
											where we didn&#39;t have enough troops,
											we didn&#39;t have enough resources,
											that Afghans were frustrated —
											they felt there wasn&#39;t enough progress
											and economic development and security,
											and therefore the Taliban came back —
											that we responded in 2005 and 2006
											with troop deployments,
											but we still didn&#39;t put enough troops on the ground.
											And that it wasn&#39;t until 2009,
											when President Obama signed off on a surge,
											that we finally had,
											in the words of Secretary Clinton,
											&quot;the strategy, the leadership and the resources.&quot;
											So, as the president now reassures us,
											we are on track to achieve our goals.

											All of this is wrong.
											Every one of those statements is wrong.
											Afghanistan does not
											pose an existential threat
											to global security.
											It is extremely unlikely
											the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country —
											extremely unlikely they&#39;d be able to seize Kabul.
											They simply don&#39;t have a conventional military option.
											And even if they were able to do so, even if I&#39;m wrong,
											it&#39;s extremely unlikely
											the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda.
											From the Taliban&#39;s point of view,
											that was their number one mistake last time.
											If they hadn&#39;t invited back Al-Qaeda,
											they would still be in power today.

											Furthermore, it&#39;s simply not true
											that what went wrong in Afghanistan
											is the light footprint.
											In my experience, in fact,
											the light footprint was extremely helpful.
											And these troops that we brought in —
											it&#39;s a great picture of David Beckham
											there on the sub-machine gun —
											made the situation worse, not better.
											When I walked across Afghanistan
											in the winter of 2001-2002,
											what I saw was scenes like this.
											A girl, if you&#39;re lucky,
											in the corner of a dark room —
											lucky to be able to look at the Koran.
											But in those early days
											when we&#39;re told we didn&#39;t have enough troops and enough resources,
											we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan.
											Within a few months,
											there were two and a half million more girls in school.
											In Sangin where I was sick in 2002,
											the nearest health clinic
											was within three days walk.
											Today, there are 14 health clinics
											in that area alone.
											There was amazing improvements.
											We went from almost no Afghans
											having mobile telephones during the Taliban
											to a situation where, almost overnight,
											three million Afghans had mobile telephones.
											And we had progress in the free media.
											We had progress in elections —
											all of this with the so-called light footprint.

											But when we began to bring more money,
											when we began to invest more resources,
											things got worse, not better. How?
											Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year
											into a country like Afghanistan
											where the entire revenue of the Afghan state
											is one billion dollars a year,
											you drown everything.
											It&#39;s not simply corruption and waste
											that you create;
											you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government,
											the elected Afghan government,
											with the micromanaging tendencies
											of foreigners on short tours
											with their own priorities.
											And the same is true for the troops.

											When I walked across Afghanistan,
											I stayed with people like this.
											This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj.
											Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host.
											He was very generous,
											like many of the Afghans I stayed with.
											But he was also considerably more conservative,
											considerably more anti-foreign,
											considerably more Islamist
											than we&#39;d like to acknowledge.
											This man, for example, Mullah Mustafa,
											tried to shoot me.
											And the reason I&#39;m looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph
											is I was somewhat frightened,
											and I was too afraid on this occasion
											to ask him, having run for an hour through the desert
											and taken refuge in this house,
											why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me.
											But 18 months later, I asked him
											why he had tried to shoot me.
											And Mullah Mustafa — he&#39;s the man with the pen and paper —
											explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph,
											Nadir Shah
											had bet him that he couldn&#39;t hit me.
											Now this is not to say
											Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa.
											It&#39;s not; it&#39;s a wonderful place
											full of incredible energy and intelligence.
											But it is a place
											where the putting-in of the troops
											has increased the violence rather than decreased it.

											2005, Anthony Fitzherbert,
											an agricultural engineer,
											could travel through Helmand,
											could stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh,
											which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place.
											Today, he could never do that.
											So the idea that we deployed the troops
											to respond to the Taliban insurgency
											is mistaken.
											Rather than preceding the insurgency,
											the Taliban followed the troop deployment,
											and as far as I&#39;m concerned,
											the troop deployment caused their return.

											No, there have been any number of people

											I ran a center at Harvard

											and there were people like Michael Semple there
											who speak Afghan languages fluently,

											Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 —

											that the counter-insurgency strategy
											was not working and would not work.
											And yet, nobody listened to them.

											How do we allow
											any of this to happen?
											Well the answer, of course, is,
											if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion
											dollars a year in a country,
											you co-opt almost everybody.
											Even the aid agencies,
											who begin to receive an enormous amount of money

											The first thing we need to change

											Very, very sadly,

											have very little idea of what&#39;s going on.
											The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months;
											Italian soldiers, on tours of four months;

											In the British embassy in Afghanistan
											in 2008,
											an embassy of 350 people,

											the main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level.
											And there was not a single Pashto speaker.
											In the Afghan section in London

											I was told last year
											that there was not a single staff member
											of the foreign office in that section
											who had ever served

											So we need to change that institutional culture.

											Secondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals.
											We need to make sure that we&#39;re a little bit suspicious,
											that we understand that optimism
											is in the DNA of the military,
											that we don&#39;t respond to it
											with quite as much alacrity.
											And thirdly, we need to have some humility.
											We need to begin from the position

											Bosnia and Kosovo

											It&#39;s almost impossible to believe the progress we&#39;ve made

											Refugee return,

											You need to understand that in those places

											was, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic
											in coming to the agreement,
											and then the fact those men went,
											that the regional situation improved,

											And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo,
											a lot of the secret of what we did,
											a lot of the secret of our success,
											was our humility —
											was the tentative nature of our engagement.
											We criticized people a lot in Bosnia
											for being quite slow to take on war criminals.
											We criticized them
											for being quite slow to return refugees.
											But that slowness, that caution,
											the fact that President Clinton initially said
											that American troops would only be deployed for a year,

											One of the saddest things
											about our involvement in Afghanistan

											Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan.
											If what we&#39;re interested in is regional stability,
											Egypt is far more important.
											If what we&#39;re worried about is poverty and development,
											sub-Saharan Africa is far more important.
											This doesn&#39;t mean that Afghanistan doesn&#39;t matter,

											So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention,
											what we need to think of
											is something like mountain rescue.
											Why mountain rescue?
											Because when people talk about intervention,
											they imagine that some scientific theory —
											the Rand Corporation goes around
											counting 43 previous insurgencies
											producing mathematical formula
											saying you need one trained counter-insurgent
											for every 20 members of the population.
											This is the wrong way of looking at it.
											You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue.

									<p>
											When you&#39;re doing mountain rescue,
											you don&#39;t take a doctorate in mountain rescue,
											you look for somebody who knows the terrain.
											It&#39;s about context.
											You understand that you can prepare,
											but the amount of preparation you can do
											is limited —
											you can take some water, you can have a map,
											you can have a pack.
											But what really matters
											is two kinds of problems —
											problems that occur on the mountain
											which you couldn&#39;t anticipate,
											such as, for example, ice on a slope,
											but which you can get around,
											and problems which you couldn&#39;t anticipate
											and which you can&#39;t get around,
											like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche
											or a change in the weather.

									<p>
											And the key to this
											is a guide who has been on that mountain,
											in every temperature,
											at every period —
											a guide who, above all,
											knows when to turn back,
											who doesn&#39;t press on relentlessly
											when conditions turn against them.
											What we look for
											in firemen, in climbers, in policemen,
											and what we should look for in intervention,
											is intelligent risk takers —
											not people who plunge blind off a cliff,
											not people who jump into a burning room,
											but who weigh their risks,
											weigh their responsibilities.
											Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan
											is this idea
											that failure is not an option.
											It makes failure invisible,
											inconceivable and inevitable.
											And if we can resist
											this crazy slogan,
											we shall discover —
											in Egypt, in Syria, in Libya,
											and anywhere else we go in the world —
											that if we can often do much less than we pretend,
											we can do much more than we fear.

											And we are always being tempted up to our neck.
											We put our toes in and we go up to our neck.
											What we should have done in Libya

											We should have limited ourselves very, very strictly
											to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi.
											We could have done that.
											We set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours

											within 48 hours.
											Instead of which, we&#39;ve allowed ourselves to be tempted

											In doing so, we&#39;ve destroyed our credibility with the Security Council,
