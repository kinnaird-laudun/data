<title>Mac Stone: Stunning photos of the endangered Everglades | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For centuries, people have viewed swamps and wetlands as obstacles to avoid. But for photographer Mac Stone, who documents the stories of wildlife in Florida&#39;s Everglades, the swamp isn&#39;t a hindrance — it&#39;s a national treasure. Through his stunning photographs, Stone shines a new light on a neglected, ancient and important wilderness. His message: get out and experience it for yourself. &quot;Just do it — put your feet in the water,&quot; he says. &quot;The swamp will change you, I promise.&quot;" />

<meta content='Stunning photos of the endangered Everglades' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='For centuries, people have viewed swamps and wetlands as obstacles to avoid. But for photographer Mac Stone, who documents the stories of wildlife in Florida&#x0027;s Everglades, the swamp isn&#x0027;t a hindrance — it&#x0027;s a national treasure. Through his stunning photographs, Stone shines a new light on a neglected, ancient and important wilderness. His message: get out and experience it for yourself. "Just do it — put your feet in the water," he says. "The swamp will change you, I promise."' itemprop='description'>

between the public

us to be here in the first place.

											Growing up here in North Central Florida,
											it always had these enchanted names,
											places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,
											Corkscrew, Big Cypress.
											I started what turned
into a five-year project
											to hopefully reintroduce
the Everglades in a new light,
											in a more inspired light.
											But I knew this would be a tall order,
because here you have an area
											that&#39;s roughly a third the size
the state of Florida, it&#39;s huge.
											And when I say Everglades,
											most people are like,
&quot;Oh, yeah, the national park.&quot;
											But the Everglades is not just a park;
it&#39;s an entire watershed,
											starting with the Kissimmee
chain of lakes in the north,
											and then as the rains
would fall in the summer,
											these downpours would flow
into Lake Okeechobee,
											and Lake Okeechobee would fill up
and it would overflow its banks
											and spill southward, ever slowly,
with the topography,
											and get into the river of grass,
the Sawgrass Prairies,
											before meting into the cypress slews,
											until going further south
into the mangrove swamps,
											and then finally — finally —
reaching Florida Bay,
											the emerald gem of the Everglades,
											the great estuary,
											the 850 square-mile estuary.

											So sure, the national park
is the southern end of this system,
											but all the things that make it unique
are these inputs that come in,
											the fresh water that starts
100 miles north.
											So no manner of these political
or invisible boundaries
											protect the park from polluted water
or insufficient water.
											And unfortunately, that&#39;s precisely
what we&#39;ve done.
											Over the last 60 years,
											we have drained, we have dammed,
we have dredged the Everglades
											to where now only one third of the water
that used to reach the bay
											now reaches the bay today.
											So this story is not all sunshine
and rainbows, unfortunately.
											For better or for worse,

											and we&#39;re trading it for this,
											at an alarming rate.
											And what&#39;s lost on so many people
											is the sheer scale
of which we&#39;re discussing.
											Because the Everglades is not just
responsible for the drinking water
											for 7 million Floridians;
											today it also provides
the agricultural fields
											for the year-round tomatoes and oranges
											for over 300 million Americans.
											And it&#39;s that same seasonal pulse
of water in the summer
											that built the river of grass
6,000 years ago.
											Ironically, today, it&#39;s also responsible
for the over half a million acres
											of the endless river of sugarcane.
											These are the same fields
that are responsible
											for dumping exceedingly high levels
of fertilizers into the watershed,
											forever changing the system.

											But in order for you to not just
understand how this system works,
											but to also get personally
connected to it,
											I decided to break the story down
into several different narratives.
											And I wanted that story to start
in Lake Okeechobee,
											the beating heart of the Everglade system.
											And to do that, I picked an ambassador,
											an iconic species.
											This is the Everglade snail kite.
											It&#39;s a great bird,
											and they used to nest in the thousands,
											thousands in the northern Everglades.
											And then they&#39;ve gone down
to about 400 nesting pairs today.
											And why is that?
											Well, it&#39;s because they eat
one source of food, an apple snail,
											about the size of a ping-pong ball,
an aquatic gastropod.

									<p>
											So as we started damming up
the Everglades,
											as we started diking Lake Okeechobee
and draining the wetlands,
											we lost the habitat for the snail.
											And thus, the population
of the kites declined.
											And so, I wanted a photo that would
not only communicate this relationship
											between wetland, snail and bird,
											but I also wanted a photo
that would communicate
											how incredible this relationship was,
											and how very important it is
that they&#39;ve come to depend on each other,
											this healthy wetland and this bird.
											And to do that, I brainstormed this idea.
											I started sketching
out these plans to make a photo,
											and I sent it to the wildlife biologist
down in Okeechobee —
											this is an endangered bird,
so it takes special permission to do.
											So I built this submerged platform
											that would hold snails
just right under the water.
											And I spent months planning
this crazy idea.
											And I took this platform
down to Lake Okeechobee
											and I spent over a week in the water,
											wading waist-deep,
9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,
											to get one image that I thought
might communicate this.
											And here&#39;s the day that it finally worked:

After setting up the platform,

coming over the cattails.
											And I see him scanning and searching.

											You can believe how excited I was
when that happened.
											But what the idea was,
											is that for someone
who&#39;s never seen this bird
											and has no reason to care about it,
											these photos, these new perspectives,
											will help shed a little new light
on just one species
											that makes this watershed
so incredible, so valuable, so important.
											Now, I know I can&#39;t come
here to Gainesville
											and talk to you about animals
in the Everglades
											without talking about gators.
											I love gators, I grew up loving gators.
											My parents always said I had
an unhealthy relationship with gators.
											But what I like about them is,
											they&#39;re like the freshwater
equivalent of sharks.
											They&#39;re feared, they&#39;re hated,
											and they are tragically misunderstood.
											Because these are a unique species,
they&#39;re not just apex predators.
											In the Everglades,
											they are the very architects
of the Everglades,
											because as the water drops
down in the winter
											during the dry season,
											they start excavating these holes
called gator holes.
											And they do this because
as the water drops down,
											they&#39;ll be able to stay wet
and they&#39;ll be able to forage.
											And now this isn&#39;t just affecting them,
											other animals also depend
on this relationship,
											so they become a keystone species as well.
											So how do you make an apex predator,
an ancient reptile,
											at once look like it dominates the system,
											but at the same time, look vulnerable?
											Well, you wade into a pit
of about 120 of them,
											then you hope that you&#39;ve made
the right decision.

success stories of the US.
											But there is one species in the Everglades
that no matter who you are,
											you can&#39;t help but love, too,
and that&#39;s the roseate spoonbill.
											These birds are great, but they&#39;ve had
a really tough time in the Everglades,
											because they started out with thousands
of nesting pairs in Florida Bay,
											and at the turn of the 20th century,
											they got down to two — two nesting pairs.
											And why?
											That&#39;s because women thought
they looked better on their hats
											then they did flying in the sky.
											Then we banned the plume trade,
											and their numbers started rebounding.
											And as their numbers started rebounding,
											scientists began to pay attention,
											they started studying these birds.

											And what they found out is that
											these birds&#39; behavior
is intrinsically tied
											to the annual draw-down
cycle of water in the Everglades,
											the thing that defines
the Everglades watershed.
											What they found out is that
											these birds started nesting in the winter
as the water drew down,
											because they&#39;re tactile feeders,
so they have to touch whatever they eat.
											And so they wait for these
concentrated pools of fish
											to be able to feed enough
to feed their young.
											So these birds became the very icon
of the Everglades —
											an indicator species
of the overall health of the system.
											And just as their numbers were rebounding
in the mid-20th century —
											shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 —
											just as that started happening, we started
draining the southern Everglades.
											And we stopped two-thirds
of that water from moving south.
											And it had drastic consequences.
											And just as those numbers
started reaching their peak,
											unfortunately, today,
the real spoonbill story,
											the real photo of what it looks like
is more something like this.
											And we&#39;re down to less than 70
nesting pairs in Florida Bay today,
											because we&#39;ve disrupted
the system so much.
											So all these different organizations
are shouting, they&#39;re screaming,
											&quot;The Everglades is fragile! It&#39;s fragile!&quot;
											It is not.
											It is resilient.
											Because despite all we&#39;ve taken,
despite all we&#39;ve done and we&#39;ve drained
											and we&#39;ve dammed and we&#39;ve dredged it,
											pieces of it are still here,

ambitious wetland restoration project,
											the international spotlight
is on us in the Sunshine State.
											Because if we can heal this system,
											it&#39;s going to become an icon
for wetland restoration
											all over the world.
											But it&#39;s up to us to decide which legacy
we want to attach our flag to.

											They say that the Everglades
is our greatest test.
											If we pass it, we get to keep the planet.
											I love that quote,
											because it&#39;s a challenge, it&#39;s a prod.
											Can we do it? Will we do it?
											We have to, we must.
											But the Everglades is not just a test.
											It&#39;s also a gift,
											and ultimately, our responsibility.
