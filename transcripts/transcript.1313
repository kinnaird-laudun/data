<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Adam Garone has an impressive moustache, and it&#39;s for a good cause. A co-founder of Movember, Garone&#39;s initiative to raise awareness for men&#39;s health -- by having men grow out their moustaches every November -- began as a dare in a bar in 2003. Now, it&#39;s a worldwide movement that raised $126 million for prostate cancer research last year. " />

											So the most common question I get asked,
											and I&#39;m going to answer it now so I don&#39;t have to do it
											over drinks tonight, is how did this come about?
											How did Movember start?
											Well, normally, a charity starts with the cause, and someone
											that is directly affected by a cause.
											They then go on to create an event, and beyond that,
											a foundation to support that.
											Pretty much in every case, that&#39;s how a charity starts.
											Not so with Movember. Movember started in a very
											traditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon.
											I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers,
											and I was watching the world go by,
											had a few more beers, and the conversation turned
											to &#39;70s fashion — (Laughter) —
											and how everything manages to come back into style.
											And a few more beers, I said, &quot;There has to be some stuff
											that hasn&#39;t come back.&quot; (Laughter)
											Then one more beer and it was, whatever happened to the mustache?
											Why hasn&#39;t that made a comeback? (Laughter)
											So then there was a lot more beers, and then the day ended
											with a challenge to bring the mustache back. (Laughter)

									<p>
											So in Australia, &quot;mo&quot; is slang for mustache,
											so we renamed the month of November &quot;Movember&quot;
											and created some pretty basic rules, which still stand today.
											And they are: start the month clean-shaven,
											rock a mustache — not a beard, not a goatee, a mustache —
											for the 30 days of November, and then we agreed
											that we would come together at the end of the month,
											have a mustache-themed party, and award a prize
											for the best, and of course, the worst mustache. (Laughter)

											Now trust me, when you&#39;re growing a mustache
											back in 2003, and there were 30 of us back then,
											and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement
											— (Laughter) —
											it created a lot of controversy. (Laughter)
											So my boss wouldn&#39;t let me go and see clients.
											My girlfriend at the time, who&#39;s no longer my girlfriend — (Laughter) — hated it.
											Parents would shuffle kids away from us. (Laughter)
											But we came together at the end of the month and
											we celebrated our journey, and it was a real journey.
											And we had a lot of fun, and in 2004, I said to the guys,
											&quot;That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this
											so we can get away with it year on year.&quot; (Laughter)

									<p>
											So we started thinking about that, and we were inspired
											by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer.
											And we thought, you know what, there&#39;s nothing for men&#39;s health.
											Why is that? Why can&#39;t we combine growing a mustache
											and doing something for men&#39;s health?
											And I started to research that topic, and discovered
											prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer
											in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But there was nothing for this cause,
											so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer,
											and then we created our tagline, which is,
											&quot;Changing the face of men&#39;s health.&quot;
											And that eloquently describes the challenge,
											changing your appearance for the 30 days,
											and also the outcome that we&#39;re trying to achieve:
											getting men engaged in their health, having them have
											a better understanding about the health risks that they face.

									<p>
											So with that model, I then
											cold-called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.
											I said to him, &quot;I&#39;ve got the most amazing idea
											that&#39;s going to transform your organization.&quot; (Laughter)
											And I didn&#39;t want to share with him the idea over the phone,
											so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne
											in 2004.
											And we sat down, and I shared with him my vision
											of getting men growing mustaches across Australia,
											raising awareness for this cause,
											and funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership
											to legitimately do that.
											And I said, &quot;We&#39;re going to come together at the end,
											we&#39;re going to have a mustache-themed party, we&#39;re going to have DJs,
											we&#39;re going to celebrate life, and we&#39;re going to change the face of men&#39;s health.&quot;
											And he just looked at me and laughed, and he said,
											he said, &quot;Adam, that&#39;s a really novel idea,
											but we&#39;re an ultraconservative organization.
											We can&#39;t have anything to do with you.&quot; (Laughter)
											So I paid for coffee that day — (Laughter) —
											and his parting comment as we shook hands was,
											&quot;Listen, if you happen to raise any money out of this,
											we&#39;ll gladly take it.&quot; (Laughter)

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So my lesson that year was persistence.
											And we persisted, and we got 450 guys
											growing mustaches, and together we raised 54,000 dollars,
											and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia,
											and that represented at the time the single biggest donation
											they&#39;d ever received.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So from that day forward, my life has become about a mustache.
											Every day — this morning, I wake up and go, my life
											is about a mustache. (Laughter)
											Essentially, I&#39;m a mustache farmer. (Laughter)
											And my season is November. (Applause)

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So in 2005, the campaign got more momentum,
											was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand,
											and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.
											It was consuming so much of our time after hours
											on weekends that we thought, we either need
											to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember
											so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time
											in the organization and take it to the next level.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											It&#39;s really interesting when you try and figure a way
											to fund a fundraising organization
											built off growing mustaches. (Laughter)
											Let me tell you that there&#39;s not too many people interested
											in investing in that, not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation,
											who we&#39;d raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage.
											So again we persisted, and Foster&#39;s Brewing came to the party
											and gave us our first ever sponsorship,
											and that was enough for me to quit my job, I did consulting on the side.
											And leading into Movember 2006,
											we&#39;d run through all the money from Foster&#39;s,
											we&#39;d run through all the money I had, and essentially
											we had no money left, and we&#39;d convinced all our suppliers —
											creative agencies, web development agencies,
											hosting companies, whatnot — to delay their billing until December.
											So we&#39;d racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars
											worth of debt. So if Movember 2006 didn&#39;t happen,
											the four founders, well, we would&#39;ve been broke,
											we would&#39;ve been homeless, sitting on the street
											with mustaches. (Laughter)
											But we thought, you know what, if that&#39;s the worst thing
											that happens, so what?
											We&#39;re going to have a lot of fun doing it, and it taught us
											the importance of taking risks and really smart risks.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Then in early 2007, a really interesting thing happened.
											We had Mo Bros from Canada, from the U.S.,
											and from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying,
											hey, there&#39;s nothing for prostate cancer.
											Bring this campaign to these countries.
											So we thought, why not? Let&#39;s do it.
											So I cold-called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada,
											and I said to him, &quot;I have this most amazing concept.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											&quot;It&#39;s going to transform your organization. I don&#39;t want
											to tell you about it now, but will you meet with me
											if I fly all the way to Toronto?&quot; So I flew here,
											met down on Front Street East, and we sat in the boardroom,
											and I said, &quot;Right, here&#39;s my vision of getting men growing mustaches
											all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization.&quot;
											And he looked at me and laughed and said,
											&quot;Adam, sounds like a really novel idea, but we&#39;re
											an ultraconservative organization.&quot; (Laughter)
											I&#39;ve heard this before. I know how it goes.
											But he said, &quot;We will partner with you,
											but we&#39;re not going to invest in it. You need to figure
											a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what we did was, we took some of the money that
											we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across
											to this country, the U.S, and the U.K., and we did that
											because we knew, if this was successful,
											we could raise infinitely more money globally
											than we could just in Australia. And that money
											fuels research, and that research will get us to a cure.
											And we&#39;re not about finding an Australian cure
											or a Canadian cure, we&#39;re about finding the cure.

									<p>
											So in 2007, we brought the campaign across here,
											and it was, it set the stage for the campaign.
											It wasn&#39;t as successful as we thought it would be.
											We were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia
											and New Zealand at that stage.
											So that year really taught us the importance of being patient
											and really understanding the local market before you
											become so bold as to set lofty targets.

											But what I&#39;m really pleased to say is, in 2010,
											Movember became a truly global movement.
											Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of
											the number one fundraising campaign in the world.
											Last year we had 450,000 Mo Bros spread across the world
											and together we raised 77 million dollars.
											(Applause)
											And that makes Movember now the biggest funder
											of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world.
											And that is an amazing achievement when you think about
											us growing mustaches. (Laughter)

											And for us, we have redefined charity.
											Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon. (Laughter)
											Our ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas,
											and I think that&#39;s been fundamental to our success.
											We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people.

									<p>
											So now I live in Los Angeles, because
											the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there,
											and I always get asked by the media down there,
											because it&#39;s so celebrity-driven,
											&quot;Who are your celebrity ambassadors?&quot;
											And I say to them, &quot;Last year we were fortunate enough
											to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors.&quot;
											And they go, &quot;What, what do you mean?&quot;
											And it&#39;s like, everything single person, every single Mo Bro

									<p>
											Now what I want to share with you is
											one of my most touching Movember moments,
											and it happened here in Toronto last year,
											at the end of the campaign.
											I was out with a team. It was the end of Movember.
											We&#39;d had a great campaign, and to be honest, we&#39;d had
											our fair share of beer that night, but I said,
											&quot;You know what, I think we&#39;ve got one more bar left in us.&quot; (Laughter)
											So we piled into a taxi, and this is our taxi driver,
											and I was sitting in the back seat, and he turned around
											and said, &quot;Where are you going?&quot;
											And I said, &quot;Hang on, that is an amazing mustache.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And he said, &quot;I&#39;m doing it for Movember.&quot; And I said,
											&quot;So am I.&quot; And I said, &quot;Tell me your Movember story.&quot;
											And he goes, &quot;Listen, I know it&#39;s about men&#39;s health,
											I know it&#39;s about prostate cancer, but this is for breast cancer.&quot;
											And I said, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s interesting.&quot;
											And he goes, &quot;Last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka,
											because we couldn&#39;t afford proper treatment for her,&quot;
											and he said, &quot;This mustache is my tribute to my mom.&quot;
											And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi,
											and I didn&#39;t tell him who I was, because I didn&#39;t think it was appropriate,
											and I just shook his hand and I said, &quot;Thank you so much.
											Your mom would be so proud.&quot;
											And from that moment I realized that Movember
											is so much more than a mustache, having a joke.
											It&#39;s about each person coming to this platform,
											embracing it in their own way,
											and being significant in their own life.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											For us now at Movember, we really focus on
											three program areas, and having a true impact:
											awareness and education,
											survivor support programs, and research.
											Now we always focus, naturally, on how much we raise,
											because it&#39;s a very tangible outcome, but for me,
											awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise,
											because I know that is changing and saving lives today,
											and it&#39;s probably best exampled by
											a young guy that I met at South by Southwest
											in Austin, Texas, at the start of the year.
											He came up to me and said, &quot;Thank you for starting Movember.&quot;
											And I said, &quot;Thank you for doing Movember.&quot;
											And I looked at him, and I was like, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you can&#39;t grow a mustache.&quot; (Laughter)
											And I said, &quot;What&#39;s your Movember story?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;I grew the worst mustache ever.&quot; (Laughter)
											&quot;But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner, and pretty quickly
											the conversation around the table turned to
											what the hell was going on.&quot; (Laughter)
											&quot;And we talked — I talked to them about Movember,
											and then after that, my dad came up to me, and at the age
											of 26, for the first time ever, I had a conversation with my dad
											one on one about men&#39;s health. I had a conversation
											with my dad about prostate cancer, and I learned
											that my grandfather had prostate cancer
											and I was able to share with my dad that he was
											twice as likely to get that disease, and he didn&#39;t know that,
											and he hadn&#39;t been getting screened for it.&quot;
											So now, that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So those conversations, getting men engaged in this,
											at whatever age, is so critically important,
											and in my view so much more important
											than the funds we raise.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now to the funds we raise, and research,
											and how we&#39;re redefining research.
											We fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries.
											We literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions
											and researchers around the world, and when we looked
											at this more recently, we realized there&#39;s a real lack
											of collaboration going on even within institutions,
											let alone nationally, let alone globally, and this is not unique
											to prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over.
											And so we said, right, we&#39;d redefined charity. We need
											to redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that?
											So what we did was, we created a global action plan,
											and we&#39;re taking 10 percent of what&#39;s raised in each country
											now and putting it into a global fund, and we&#39;ve got
											the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world
											that look after that fund,
											and they come together each year and identify
											the number one priority,
											and that, last year, was getting a better screening test.
											So they identified that as a priority, and then
											they&#39;ve got and recruited now 300 researchers
											from around the world that are studying that topic,
											essentially the same topic.
											So now we&#39;re funding them to the tune of about
											five or six million dollars to collaborate
											and bringing them together, and that&#39;s a unique thing
											in the cancer world, and we know, through that collaboration,
											it will accelerate outcomes.
											And that&#39;s how we&#39;re redefining the research world.

											So, what I know about my Movember journey is that,
											with a really creative idea,
											with passion, with persistence, and a lot of patience,
											four mates, four mustaches,
											can inspire a room full of people,
											and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city,
											and that city is Melbourne, my home.
											And that city can go on and inspire a state, and that state
											can go on and inspire a nation, and beyond that,

","whylisten":"<p class=\"p1\">With a background in web and mobile marketing, Australian native Adam Garone&#39;s career took a left turn in 2003 when his brother challenged him to grow out a moustache. The two wondered if they could bring the moustache back in vogue and, in the process, raise awareness for men&#39;s health along with money for prostate cancer research. Thus began the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://movember.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Movember</a> movement. Garone serves as CEO.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Movember challenge is simple: men begin November 1st clean shaven and, for the next 30 days, grow out their moustaches while seeking out sponsorship for their efforts. The proceeds go to the Prostate Cancer Foundation as well as Livestrong. In 2011, Movember raised $126 million in 14 countries.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Adam Garone","tags":["TEDx","culture","men","philanthropy"],"title":"Healthier men, one moustache at a time","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":724190}]}
