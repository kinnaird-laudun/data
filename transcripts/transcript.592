											I am going to speak about corruption,
											but I would like to juxtapose
											two different things.
											One is the large global economy,
											the large globalized economy,
											and the other one is the small, and very limited,
											capacity of our traditional governments
											and their international institutions
											to govern, to shape, this economy.
											Because there is this asymmetry,
											which creates, basically,
											failing governance.
											Failing governance in many areas:
											in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment,
											in the area of exploitation of women and children,
											in the area of climate change,
											in all the areas in which we really need
											a capacity to reintroduce
											the primacy of politics
											into the economy,
											which is operating in a worldwide arena.
											And I think corruption,
											and the fight against corruption,
											and the impact of corruption,
											is probably one of the most interesting ways
											to illustrate what I mean
											with this failure of governance.

											Let me talk about my own experience.
											I used to work as the director
											of the World Bank office in Nairobi
											for East Africa.
											At that time, I noticed
											that corruption, that grand corruption,
											that systematic corruption,
											was undermining everything we were trying to do.
											And therefore, I began
											to not only try to protect
											the work of the World Bank,
											our own projects, our own programs
											against corruption,
											but in general, I thought, &quot;We need a system
											to protect the people
											in this part of the world
											from the ravages of corruption.&quot;
											And as soon as I started this work,
											I received a memorandum from the World Bank,
											from the legal department first,
											in which they said, &quot;You are not allowed to do this.
											You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.
											This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank,
											so I want you to stop your doings.&quot;

											In the meantime, I was chairing
											donor meetings, for instance,
											in which the various donors,
											and many of them like to be in Nairobi —
											it is true, it is one of the
											unsafest cities of the world,
											but they like to be there because the other cities
											are even less comfortable.
											And in these donor meetings, I noticed
											that many of the worst projects —
											which were put forward
											by our clients, by the governments,
											by promoters,
											many of them representing
											suppliers from the North —
											that the worst projects
											were realized first.
											Let me give you an example:
											a huge power project,
											300 million dollars,
											to be built smack into
											one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,
											areas of western Kenya.
											And we all noticed immediately
											that this project had no economic benefits:
											It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,
											nobody was interested in irrigation projects.
											To the contrary, we knew that this project
											would destroy the environment:
											It would destroy riparian forests,
											which were the basis for
											the survival of nomadic groups,
											the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.
											So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,
											this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project —
											not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country
											for these hundreds of millions of dollars,
											and the siphoning off
											of the scarce resources of the economy
											from much more important activities
											like schools, like hospitals and so on.
											And yet, we all rejected this project,
											none of the donors was willing
											to have their name connected with it,
											and it was the first project to be implemented.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The good projects, which we as a donor community
											would take under our wings,
											they took years, you know,
											you had too many studies,
											and very often they didn&#39;t succeed.
											But these bad projects,
											which were absolutely damaging — for the economy
											for many generations, for the environment,
											for thousands of families who had to be resettled —
											they were suddenly put together
											by consortia of banks,
											of supplier agencies,
											of insurance agencies —
											like in Germany, Hermes, and so on —
											and they came back very, very quickly,
											driven by an unholy alliance
											between the powerful elites
											in the countries there
											and the suppliers from the North.
											Now, these suppliers
											were our big companies.
											They were the actors of this global market,
											which I mentioned in the beginning.
											They were the Siemenses of this world,
											coming from France, from the UK, from Japan,
											from Canada, from Germany,
											and they were systematically driven
											by systematic, large-scale corruption.
											We are not talking about
											50,000 dollars here,
											or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.
											No, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars
											on the Swiss bank accounts,
											on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,
											of the president&#39;s ministers,
											the high officials in the para-statal sectors.

											This was the reality which I saw,
											and not only one project like that:
											I saw, I would say,
											over the years I worked in Africa,
											I saw hundreds of projects like this.
											And so, I became convinced
											that it is this systematic corruption
											which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,
											which is the main reason
											for the misery, for the poverty,
											for the conflicts, for the violence,
											for the desperation
											in many of these countries.
											That we have today
											more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,
											that we have more than a billion people
											without proper drinking water in the world,
											twice that number,
											more than two billion people
											without sanitation and so on,

											Now, why did the World Bank
											not let me do this work?
											I found out afterwards,
											after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.
											The reason was that the members of the World Bank
											thought that foreign bribery was okay,
											including Germany.
											In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.
											It was even tax-deductible.
											No wonder that most of the most important
											international operators in Germany,
											but also in France and the UK
											and Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.
											Not all of them, but most of them.
											And this is the phenomenon
											which I call failing governance,
											because when I then came to Germany
											and started this little NGO
											here in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,
											we were told, &quot;You cannot stop
											our German exporters from bribing,
											because we will lose our contracts.
											We will lose to the French,
											we will lose to the Swedes, we&#39;ll lose to the Japanese.&quot;
											And therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner&#39;s dilemma,
											which made it very difficult
											for an individual company,
											an individual exporting country
											to say, &quot;We are not going to
											continue this deadly, disastrous
											habit of large companies to bribe.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So this is what I mean
											with a failing governance structure,
											because even the powerful government,
											which we have in Germany, comparatively,
											was not able to say,
											&quot;We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad.&quot;
											They needed help,
											and the large companies themselves
											have this dilemma.
											Many of them didn&#39;t want to bribe.
											Many of the German companies, for instance,
											believe that they are really
											producing a high-quality product
											at a good price, so they are very competitive.
											They are not as good at bribing
											as many of their international competitors are,
											but they were not allowed
											to show their strengths,
											because the world was eaten up
											by grand corruption.

									<p>
											And this is why I&#39;m telling you this:
											Civil society rose to the occasion.
											We had this small NGO,
											Transparency International.
											They began to think of
											an escape route from this prisoner&#39;s dilemma,
											and we developed concepts
											of collective action,
											basically trying to bring various competitors
											together around the table,
											explaining to all of them
											how much it would be in their interests
											if they simultaneously would stop bribing,
											and to make a long story short,
											we managed to eventually
											get Germany to sign
											together with the other OECD countries
											and a few other exporters.

											In 1997, a convention,
											under the auspices of the OECD,
											which obliged everybody
											to change their laws
											and criminalize foreign bribery.
											(Applause)
											Well, thank you. I mean, it&#39;s interesting,
											in doing this,
											we had to sit together with the companies.
											We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,
											we had sessions with about
											20 captains of industry,
											and we discussed with them
											what to do about international bribery.
											In the first session — we had three sessions
											over the course of two years.
											And President von Weizsäcker, by the way,
											chaired one of the sessions, the first one,
											to take the fear away
											from the entrepreneurs,
											who were not used to deal
											with non-governmental organizations.
											And in the first session, they all said,
											&quot;This is not bribery, what we are doing.&quot; This is customary there.
											This is what these other cultures demand.
											They even applaud it.
											In fact, [unclear]
											still says this today.
											And so there are still a lot of people
											who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.
											But in the second session,
											they admitted already that they would never do this,
											what they are doing in these other countries,
											here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.
											Cabinet ministers would admit this.
											And in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,
											we had them all sign an open letter
											to the Kohl government, at the time,
											requesting that they
											participate in the OECD convention.

									<p>
											And this is, in my opinion,
											an example of soft power,
											because we were able to convince them
											that they had to go with us.
											We had a longer-term time perspective.
											We had a broader,
											geographically much wider,
											constituency we were trying to defend.
											And that&#39;s why the law has changed.
											That&#39;s why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in
											and that&#39;s why MIN is in the trouble they are in.
											In some other countries, the OECD convention
											is not yet properly enforced.
											And, again, civil societies
											breathing down the neck of the establishment.

											In London, for instance,
											where the BAE got away

											which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,
											100 million British pounds,
											every year for ten years,
											to one particular official of one particular friendly country,
											who then bought for
											44 billion pounds of military equipment.
											This case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.
											Why? Because they consider this
											as contrary to the security interest
											of the people of Great Britain.
											Civil society is pushing, civil society
											is trying to get a solution to this problem,
											also in the U.K.,

											In Germany, we are pushing
											the ratification of the UN convention,

											We are, Germany, is not ratifying.
											Why? Because it would make it necessary
											to criminalize the corruption
											of deputies.
											In Germany, we have a system where
											you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,
											but you are allowed to bribe a deputy.
											This is, under German law, allowed,
											and the members of our parliament don&#39;t want to change this,
											and this is why they can&#39;t sign
											the U.N. convention against foreign bribery —
											one of they very, very few countries

											I see my time is ticking.
											Let me just try to
											draw some conclusions from what has happened.
											I believe that what we managed to achieve
											in fighting corruption,
											one can also achieve
											in other areas of failing governance.
											By now, the United Nations
											is totally on our side.
											The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,
											they became, I would say, the strongest
											anti-corruption agency in the world.
											Most of the large companies
											are now totally convinced
											that they have to put in place
											very strong policies
											against bribery and so on.
											And this is possible because civil society
											joined the companies
											and joined the government
											in the analysis of the problem,
											in the development of remedies,
											in the implementation of reforms,
											and then later, in the monitoring of reforms.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Of course, if civil society organizations
											want to play that role,
											they have to grow into this responsibility.
											Not all civil society organizations are good.
											The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.
											So, we must be aware
											that civil society
											has to shape up itself.
											They have to have a much more
											transparent financial governance.
											They have to have a much more participatory governance
											in many civil society organizations.
											We also need much more competence of civil society leaders.
											This is why we have set up the governance school
											and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,
											because we believe most of our educational
											and research institutions in Germany
											and continental Europe in general,
											do not focus enough, yet,
											on empowering civil society
											and training the leadership of civil society.

									<p>
											But what I&#39;m saying from my very practical experience:
											If civil society does it right
											and joins the other actors —
											in particular, governments,
											governments and their international institutions,
											but also large international actors,
											in particular those which have committed themselves
											to corporate social responsibility —
											then in this magical triangle
											between civil society,
											government and private sector,
											there is a tremendous chance

It hurts everyone whose life, livelihood or happiness depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority. </p><p>Peter Eigen knows this. He worked in economic development for 25 years, mainly as a World Bank manager of programs in Africa and Latin America. Among his assignments, he served as director of the regional mission for Eastern Africa from 1988 to 1991. Stunned by the depth and pervasiveness -- and sheer destructiveness -- of the corruption he encountered, he formed the group Transparency International to take on some of the main players in deals with corrupt officials: multinational corporations. </p><p>Eigen believes that the best way to root out corruption is to make it known. Thus, Transparency International works to raises awareness of corruption, and takes practical action to address it, including public hearings. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Peter Eigen","tags":["TEDx","corruption","global issues","money","politics"],"title":"How to expose the corrupt","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":775484}]}
