<title>Dambisa Moyo: Is China the new idol for emerging economies? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The developed world holds up the ideals of capitalism, democracy and political rights for all. Those in emerging markets often don&#39;t have that luxury. In this powerful talk, economist Dambisa Moyo makes the case that the west can&#39;t afford to rest on its laurels and imagine others will blindly follow. Instead, a different model, embodied by China, is increasingly appealing. A call for open-minded political and economic cooperation in the name of transforming the world." />

<meta content="The developed world holds up the ideals of capitalism, democracy and political rights for all. Those in emerging markets often don't have that luxury. In this powerful talk, economist Dambisa Moyo makes the case that the west can't afford to rest on its laurels and imagine others will blindly follow. Instead, a different model, embodied by China, is increasingly appealing. A call for open-minded political and economic cooperation in the name of transforming the world." itemprop='description'>

											When Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia,
											said these words in 1775,
											he could never have imagined
											just how much they would come to resonate
											with American generations to come.
											At the time, these words were earmarked
											and targeted against the British,
											but over the last 200 years, they&#39;ve come to embody
											what many Westerners believe,
											that freedom is the most cherished value,
											and that the best systems of politics and economics
											have freedom embedded in them.
											Who could blame them?
											Over the past hundred years, the combination
											of liberal democracy and private capitalism
											has helped to catapult the United States
											and Western countries
											to new levels of economic development.
											In the United States over the past hundred years,
											incomes have increased 30 times,
											and hundreds of thousands of people
											have been moved out of poverty.
											Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation
											has helped to spur industrialization
											and also helped in the creation and the building
											of things like household appliances
											such as refrigerators and televisions,
											motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets.
											It&#39;s no surprise, then, that even at the depths
											of the private capitalism crisis,
											President Obama said,
											&quot;The question before us is not whether the market
											is a force for good or ill.
											Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom
											is unmatched.&quot;
											Thus, there&#39;s understandably
											a deep-seated presumption among Westerners
											that the whole world will decide to adopt
											private capitalism as the model of economic growth,
											liberal democracy, and will continue
											to prioritize political rights over economic rights.

											However, to many who live in the emerging markets,
											this is an illusion, and even though
											the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
											which was signed in 1948,
											was unanimously adopted,
											what it did was to mask a schism
											that has emerged between developed
and developing countries,
											and the ideological beliefs
											between political and economic rights.
											This schism has only grown wider.
											Today, many people who live in the emerging markets,
											where 90 percent of the world&#39;s population lives,
											believe that the Western obsession
											with political rights is beside the point,
											and what is actually important
											is delivering on food, shelter,
											education and healthcare.
											&quot;Give me liberty or give me death&quot;
											is all well and good if you can afford it,
											but if you&#39;re living on less than one dollar a day,
											you&#39;re far too busy trying to survive
											and to provide for your family
											than to spend your time going around
											trying to proclaim and defend democracy.

											Now, I know many people in this room
											and around the world will think,
											&quot;Well actually, this is hard to grasp,&quot;
											because private capitalism and liberal democracy
											are held sacrosanct.
											But I ask you today, what would you do
											if you had to choose?
											What if you had to choose
											between a roof over your head
											and the right to vote?

											Over the last 10 years,
											I&#39;ve had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries,
											many of them in the emerging markets,
											in Latin America, Asia,
											and my own continent of Africa.
											I&#39;ve met with presidents, dissidents,
											policymakers, lawyers, teachers,
											doctors and the man on the street,
											and through these conversations,
											it&#39;s become clear to me
											that many people in the emerging markets

											Now, don&#39;t get me wrong.
											I&#39;m not saying people in the emerging markets
											don&#39;t understand democracy,
											nor am I saying that they wouldn&#39;t ideally
											like to pick their presidents or their leaders.
											Of course they would.
											However, I am saying that on balance,

											The fact of the matter
											is that this has become a very poignant question
											because there is for the first time in a long time
											a real challenge to the Western ideological systems
											of politics and economics,
											and this is a system that is embodied by China.
											And rather than have private capitalism,
they have state capitalism.
											Instead of liberal democracy,
they have de-prioritized the democratic system.
											And they have also decided to prioritize
											economic rights over political rights.
											I put it to you today that it is this system
											that is embodied by China
											that is gathering momentum amongst people
											in the emerging markets as the system to follow,
											because they believe increasingly
											that it is the system
											that will promise the best and fastest improvements
											in living standards in the shortest period of time.
											If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments
											explaining to you first
											why economically they&#39;ve come to this belief.

									<p>
											First of all, it&#39;s China&#39;s economic performance
											over the past 30 years.
											She&#39;s been able to produce record economic growth
											and meaningfully move many people out of poverty,
											specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty
											by moving over 300 million people
											out of indigence.
											It&#39;s not just in economics,
											but it&#39;s also in terms of living standards.
											We see that in China, 28 percent of people
											had secondary school access.
											Today, it&#39;s closer to 82 percent.
											So in its totality, economic improvement
											has been quite significant.

											Second, China has been able
											to meaningfully improve its income inequality
											without changing the political construct.
											Today, the United States and China
											are the two leading economies in the world.
											They have vastly different political systems
											and different economic systems,
											one with private capitalism,
											another one broadly with state capitalism.
											However, these two countries
											have the identical GINI Coefficient,
											which is a measure of income equality.
											Perhaps what is more disturbing
											is that China&#39;s income equality
											has been improving in recent times,
											whereas that of the United States
											has been declining.

											Thirdly, people in the emerging markets
											look at China&#39;s amazing and legendary
											infrastructure rollout.
											This is not just about China
											building roads and ports and railways
											in her own country —
											she&#39;s been able to build 85,000 kilometers
											of road network in China
											and surpass that of the United States —
											but even if you look to places like Africa,
											China has been able to help tar the distance
											of Cape Town to Cairo,
											which is 9,000 miles,
											or three times the distance of New York to California.
											Now this is something that people can see and point to.
											Perhaps it&#39;s no surprise
											that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,
											Africans in 10 countries said
											they thought that the Chinese were doing
											amazing things to improve their livelihoods
											by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.

											Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions
											to age-old social problems that the world faces.
											If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,
											you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics
											continue to be a stumbling block
											to the delivery of medicine and healthcare
											in the rural areas.
											However, through a network of state-owned enterprises,
											the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,
											using their companies
											to help deliver on these healthcare solutions.

											Ladies and gentlemen, it&#39;s no surprise
											that around the world, people are pointing
at what China is doing and saying,
											&quot;I like that. I want that.
											I want to be able to do what China&#39;s doing.
											That is the system that seems to work.&quot;
											I&#39;m here to also tell you
											that there are lots of shifts occurring
											around what China is doing
											in the democratic stance.
											In particular, there is growing doubt
											among people in the emerging markets,
											when people now believe that democracy
											is no longer to be viewed
											as a prerequisite for economic growth.
											In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,
											not just China, have shown that actually,
											it&#39;s economic growth that is a prerequisite
											for democracy.
											In a recent study, the evidence has shown
											that income is the greatest determinant
											of how long a democracy can last.
											The study found that if your per capita income
											is about 1,000 dollars a year,
											your democracy will last about eight and a half years.
											If your per capita income is between
											2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,
											then you&#39;re likely to only get 33 years of democracy.
											And only if your per capita income
											is above 6,000 dollars a year
											will you have democracy come hell or high water.

											What this is telling us
											is that we need to first establish a middle class
											that is able to hold the government accountable.
											But perhaps it&#39;s also telling us
											that we should be worried about going
											around the world and shoehorning democracy,
											because ultimately we run the risk

											democracies that in some sense

											The evidence around illiberal democracies
											is quite depressing.
											Freedom House finds that although 50 percent
											of the world&#39;s countries today are democratic,
											70 percent of those countries are illiberal
											in the sense that people don&#39;t have free speech
											or freedom of movement.
											But also, we&#39;re finding from Freedom House

											What this says

											who care about liberal democracy,
											is we&#39;ve got to find a more sustainable way
											of ensuring that we have a sustainable form
											of democracy in a liberal way,
											and that has its roots in economics.
											But it also says that as China moves
											toward being the largest economy in the world,
											something that is expected to happen
											by experts in 2016,
											that this schism between the political
											and economic ideologies of the West and the rest

											What might that world look like?
											Well, the world could look like

											The question that is left for us in general
											is, what then should the West be doing?
											And I suggest that they have two options.
											The West can either compete or cooperate.
											If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,
											and in effect go around the world
											and continue to try and push an agenda
											of private capitalism and liberal democracy,
											this is basically going against headwinds,
											but it also would be a natural stance
											for the West to take
											because in many ways it is the antithesis
											of the Chinese model
											of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.
											Now the fact of the matter is,
											if the West decides to compete,
											it will create a wider schism.
											The other option is for the West to cooperate,
											and by cooperating I mean
											giving the emerging market countries the flexibility
											to figure out in an organic way
											what political and economic system
											works best for them.

									<p>
											Now I&#39;m sure some of you in the room
											will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,
											and this is a way, in other words,
											for the West to take a back seat.
											But I put it to you
											that if the United States and European countries
											want to remain globally influential,
											they may have to consider cooperating
											in the short term in order to compete,
											and by that, they might have to focus
											more aggressively on economic outcomes
											to help create the middle class
											and therefore be able to hold government accountable
											and create the democracies that we really want.

											The fact of the matter is that
											instead of going around the world
											and haranguing countries for engaging with China,
											the West should be encouraging its own businesses
											to trade and invest in these regions.
											Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior,
											the West should be showing how it is
											that their own system of politics and economics
											is the superior one.
											And instead of shoehorning democracy
											around the world,
											perhaps the West should take a leaf
											out of its own history book
											and remember that it takes a lot of patience
											in order to develop the models
											and the systems that you have today.
											Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer
											reminds us that it took the United States
											nearly 170 years
											from the time that the Constitution was written
											for there to be equal rights in the United States.
											Some people would argue that today
											there is still no equal rights.
											In fact, there are groups who would argue
											that they still do not have equal rights under the law.
