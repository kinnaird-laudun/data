<title>Shonda Rhimes and Cyndi Stivers: The future of storytelling | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: &quot;We all feel a compelling need to watch stories, to tell stories ... to discuss the things that tell each one of us that we are not alone in the world,&quot; says TV titan Shonda Rhimes. A dominant force in television since &quot;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&quot; hit the airwaves, Rhimes discusses the future of media networks, how she&#39;s using her narrative-building skills as a force for good, an intriguing concept known as &quot;Amish summers&quot; and much more, in conversation with Cyndi Stivers, director of the TED Residency." />

											Shonda Rhimes:
What&#39;s never going to change.
											Obviously, I think good stories
are never going to change,
											the need for people to gather together
and exchange their stories
											and to talk about the things
that feel universal,
											the idea that we all feel
a compelling need to watch stories,
											to tell stories, to share stories —
											sort of the gathering around the campfire
											to discuss the things
that tell each one of us
											that we are not alone in the world.
											Those things to me
are never going to change.
											That essence of storytelling
is never going to change.

											CS: OK. In preparation

											CS: And she said that there was
this indelible memory she had
											of your casting process,
											where without discussing it
with any of the executives,
											you got people coming in
to read for your scripts,
											and every one of them
was the full range of humanity,
											you did not type anyone in any way,
											and that it was completely surprising.
											So she said, in addition
to retraining the studio executives,
											you also, she feels,
											and I think this is — I agree,
											retrained the expectations
of the American TV audience.
											So what else does the audience
not yet realize that it needs?

									<p>
											SR: What else does it not yet realize?
											Well, I mean, I don&#39;t think
we&#39;re anywhere near there yet.
											I mean, we&#39;re still in a place
											in which we&#39;re far, far behind what looks
like the real world in actuality.
											I wasn&#39;t bringing in
a bunch of actors
											who looked very different from one another
											simply because I was
trying to make a point,
											and I wasn&#39;t trying
to do anything special.
											It never occurred to me
that that was new, different or weird.
											I just brought in actors
because I thought they were interesting
											and to me, the idea that it
was completely surprising to everybody —
											I didn&#39;t know that for a while.
											I just thought: these are the actors
I want to see play these parts.
											I want to see what
they look like if they read.
											We&#39;ll see what happens.
											So I think the interesting thing
that happens is
											that when you look at the world
through another lens,
											when you&#39;re not the person
normally in charge of things,
											it just comes out a different way.

											CS: So you now have
this big machine that you run,
											as a titan — as you know,
last year when she gave her talk —
											she&#39;s a titan.
											So what do you think
is going to happen as we go on?
											There&#39;s a huge amount of money
involved in producing these shows.
											While the tools of making stories
have gone and gotten greatly democratized,
											there&#39;s still this large distribution:
											people who rent networks,
who rent the audience to advertisers
											and make it all pay.
											How do you see the business model changing
now that anyone can be a storyteller?

											SR: I think it&#39;s changing every day.
											I mean, the rapid, rapid change
that&#39;s happening is amazing.
											And I feel — the panic is palpable,
											and I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way.
											I think it&#39;s kind of exciting.
											The idea that there&#39;s
sort of an equalizer happening,
											that sort of means that anybody
can make something, is wonderful.
											I think there&#39;s some scary in the idea
that you can&#39;t find the good work now.
											There&#39;s so much work out there.
											I think there&#39;s something like
417 dramas on television right now
											at any given time in any given place,
											but you can&#39;t find them.
											You can&#39;t find the good ones.
											So there&#39;s a lot of bad stuff out there
because everybody can make something.
											It&#39;s like if everybody painted a painting.
											You know, there&#39;s not
that many good painters.
											But finding the good stories,
the good shows,
											is harder and harder and harder.
											Because if you have
one tiny show over here on AMC
											and one tiny show over here over there,
											finding where they are
becomes much harder.
											So I think that ferreting out the gems
											and finding out who made
the great webisode and who made this,
											it&#39;s — I mean, think
about the poor critics
											who now are spending 24 hours a day
											trapped in their homes
watching everything.
											It&#39;s not an easy job right now.
											So the distribution engines
are getting more and more vast,
											but finding the good programming
for everybody in the audience
											is getting harder.
											And unlike the news,
											where everything&#39;s getting
winnowed down to just who you are,
											television seems to be getting —
											and by television I mean anything
you can watch, television shows on —
											seems to be getting
wider and wider and wider.
											And so anybody&#39;s making stories,
											and the geniuses are sometimes hidden.
											But it&#39;s going to be harder to find,
											and at some point that will collapse.
											People keep talking about peak TV.
											I don&#39;t know when that&#39;s going to happen.
											I think at some point
it&#39;ll collapse a little bit
											and we&#39;ll, sort of, come back together.
											I don&#39;t know if it
will be network television.
											I don&#39;t know if that model is sustainable.

											Television so much is made for, like —
here&#39;s our American audience.
											We make these shows,

out into the world
											and hope for the best,
											as opposed to really thinking
about the fact that America is not it.

taking into account the fact
											that there are all
of these other places in the world

a sense of intimacy

from a television screen.
											Imagine sitting next to him,
											or being with a character like Huck
who&#39;s about to execute somebody.

to another character very rapidly,

the wheels were coming off the bus

											SR: Any other medium.
											For storytelling, other than books?
											I mean, I grew up wanting
to be Toni Morrison, so no.
											I mean, I didn&#39;t even imagine television.
											So the idea that there could be
some bigger world,
											some more magical way of making things —-
											I&#39;m always excited
when new technology comes out
											and I&#39;m always the first one
to want to try it.
											The possibilities feel endless
and exciting right now,
											which is what excites me.
											We&#39;re in this sort of Wild West period,
to me, it feels like,
											because nobody knows
what we&#39;re going to settle on.
											You can put stories anywhere right now
											and that&#39;s cool to me,
											and it feels like once we figure out
how to get the technology
											and the creativity
of storytelling to meet,
											the possibilities are endless.

											CS: And also the technology has enabled
the thing I briefly flew by earlier,
											binge-viewing,
which is a recent phenomenon,
											since you&#39;ve been doing shows, right?
											And how do you think does that change
the storytelling process at all?
											You always had a bible

											SR: No, I just always knew
where we were going to end.
											So for me,
											the only way I can really comment on that
											is that I have a show
that&#39;s been going on for 14 seasons
											and so there are the people
who have been watching it for 14 seasons,
											and then there are the 12-year-old girls
I&#39;d encounter in the grocery store
											who had watched
297 episodes in three weeks.
											Seriously, and that&#39;s a very different
experience for them,
											because they&#39;ve been inside of something
											really intensely for
a very short period of time
											in a very intense way,
											and to them the story
has a completely different arc
											and a completely different meaning
											because it never had any breaks.

											SR: I don&#39;t think
I think of story that way.
											I think of story in terms of character
and what characters would do
											and what characters need to do
in order to make them move forward,
											so I&#39;m never really thinking of story
in terms of just plot,
											and when writers come
into my writer&#39;s room and pitch me plot,
											I say, &quot;You&#39;re not speaking English.&quot;
											Like, that&#39;s the thing I say.
											We&#39;re not speaking English.
I need to hear what&#39;s real.
											And so I don&#39;t think of it that way.
											I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a way
to think there&#39;s something I wouldn&#39;t do

pieces of plot off a wall or something.

											SR: Well, you know, there&#39;s —
											That&#39;s an intense subject to me,
											because I feel like the lack of narrative
											that a lot of people have is difficult.
											You know, like,
there&#39;s a lot of organizations
											that don&#39;t have a positive narrative
that they&#39;ve created for themselves
											that would help them.
											There&#39;s a lot of campaigns
											that could be helped
with a better narrative.
											The Democrats could do a lot
											with a very strong
narrative for themselves.
											There&#39;s a lot of different things
that could happen
											in terms of using storytelling voice,
											and I don&#39;t mean that in a fiction way,
											I mean that in a same way
that any speechwriter would mean it.

In 2015, ABC snapped up Rhimes&rsquo; latest series, <em>The Catch</em>. Shondaland shows have the special ability to capture both fan devotion and critical attention &ndash; she&rsquo;s won everything from a Peabody Award to a People&rsquo;s Choice Award. </p><p>  Rhimes is known for her groundbreaking storytelling, her candor and humor in the face of her critics, and for never shying away from speaking her mind.
