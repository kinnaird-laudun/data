											I&#39;m going to give you
four specific examples,
											I&#39;m going to cover at the end
											about how a company called Silk
tripled their sales;
											how an artist named Jeff Koons
went from being a nobody
											to making a whole bunch of money
and having a lot of impact;
											to how Frank Gehry redefined
what it meant to be an architect.
											And one of my biggest failures
as a marketer in the last few years —
											a record label I started
that had a CD called &quot;Sauce.&quot;

											Before I can do that
I&#39;ve got to tell you about sliced bread,
											and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.
											Now, before sliced bread
was invented in the 1910s
											I wonder what they said?
											Like the greatest invention
since the telegraph or something.
											But this guy named Otto Rohwedder
invented sliced bread,
											and he focused, like most inventors did,
on the patent part and the making part.
											And the thing about the invention
of sliced bread is this —
											that for the first 15 years
after sliced bread was available
											no one bought it; no one knew about it;
											it was a complete and total failure.
											And the reason
is that until Wonder came along
											and figured out how to spread
the idea of sliced bread,
											no one wanted it.
											That the success of sliced bread,
											like the success of almost everything
we&#39;ve talked about at this conference,
											is not always about what the patent
is like, or what the factory is like —
											it&#39;s about can you get
your idea to spread, or not.
											And I think that the way
you&#39;re going to get what you want,
											or cause the change that you want
to change, to happen,
											is to figure out a way
to get your ideas to spread.

											And it doesn&#39;t matter to me
whether you&#39;re running a coffee shop
											or you&#39;re an intellectual,
or you&#39;re in business,
											or you&#39;re flying hot air balloons.
											I think that all this stuff applies
to everybody regardless of what we do.
											That what we are living in
is a century of idea diffusion.
											That people who can spread ideas,
regardless of what those ideas are, win.
											When I talk about it
I usually pick business,
											because they make the best pictures
that you can put in your presentation,
											and because it&#39;s the easiest
sort of way to keep score.
											But I want you to forgive me
when I use these examples
											because I&#39;m talking about anything
that you decide to spend your time to do.

											At the heart of spreading ideas
is TV and stuff like TV.
											TV and mass media made it really easy
to spread ideas in a certain way.
											I call it the &quot;TV-industrial complex.&quot;
											The way the TV-industrial complex works,
is you buy some ads,
											interrupt some people,
that gets you distribution.
											You use the distribution you get
to sell more products.
											You take the profit
from that to buy more ads.
											And it goes around and around and around,
											the same way that the military-industrial
complex worked a long time ago.
											That model of,
and we heard it yesterday —
											if we could only get
onto the homepage of Google,
											if we could only figure out
how to get promoted there,
											or grab that person by the throat,
											and tell them about what we want to do.
											If we did that then everyone would pay
attention, and we would win.
											Well, this TV-industrial complex informed
my entire childhood and probably yours.
											I mean, all of these products succeeded
because someone figured out
											how to touch people in a way
they weren&#39;t expecting,
											in a way they didn&#39;t
necessarily want, with an ad,
											over and over again until they bought it.

											And the thing that&#39;s happened is,
they canceled the TV-industrial complex.
											That just over the last few years,
											what anybody who markets
anything has discovered
											is that it&#39;s not working
the way that it used to.
											This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize;
I had a bad cold when I took it.

worth of French bread.
											Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned,
											by one baker at a time,
in a wood-fired oven.
											And when Lionel started his bakery,
the French pooh-pooh-ed it.
											They didn&#39;t want to buy his bread.
											It didn&#39;t look like &quot;French bread.&quot;
											It wasn&#39;t what they expected.

											They have something I call &quot;otaku&quot; —
it&#39;s a great Japanese word.
											It describes the desire
of someone who&#39;s obsessed to say,
											drive across Tokyo to try
a new ramen noodle place,
											because that&#39;s what they do:
they get obsessed with it.
											To make a product, to market an idea,
											to come up with any problem
you want to solve
											that doesn&#39;t have
a constituency with an otaku,

											Instead, you have to find
a group that really, desperately cares
											about what it is you have to say.
											Talk to them and make it easy
for them to tell their friends.
											There&#39;s a hot sauce otaku,
but there&#39;s no mustard otaku.
											That&#39;s why there&#39;s lots and lots
of kinds of hot sauces,
											and not so many kinds of mustard.
											Not because it&#39;s hard
to make interesting mustard —
											you could make interesting mustard —
											but people don&#39;t,
because no one&#39;s obsessed with it,
											and thus no one tells their friends.

											So what you need to do
is figure out who does care.
											Who is going to raise their hand and say,
											&quot;I want to hear what you&#39;re doing next,&quot;
											and sell something to them.
											The last example I want to give you.
											This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.
											As you can see, if that&#39;s nowhere,
it&#39;s in the middle of it.

											But they do have a lake.
											And people used to come from miles
around to swim in the lake.
											They don&#39;t anymore.
											So the founding fathers said,
&quot;We&#39;ve got some money to spend.
											What can we build here?&quot;
											And like most committees,
											they were going to build
something pretty safe.
											And then an artist came to them —
this is a true artist&#39;s rendering —
											he wants to build a 55-foot tall
lava lamp in the center of town.
											That&#39;s a purple cow;
that&#39;s something worth noticing.

that&#39;s where I&#39;m going to go.

His efforts caught the attention of Yahoo!, which bought the company in 1998 and kept Godin on as a vice president of permission marketing. Godin has produced several critically acclaimed and attention-grabbing books, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/permissionmarketing\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Permission Marketing</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://geni.us/allmarketersareliars\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All Marketers Are Liars</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/purplecow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Purple Cow</em></a>&nbsp;(which was distributed in a milk carton).

His efforts caught the attention of Yahoo!, which bought the company in 1998 and kept Godin on as a vice president of permission marketing. Godin has produced several critically acclaimed and attention-grabbing books, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/permissionmarketing\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Permission Marketing</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://geni.us/allmarketersareliars\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All Marketers Are Liars</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/purplecow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Purple Cow</em></a>&nbsp;(which was distributed in a milk carton). In 2005, Godin founded <a href=\"http://www.squidoo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Squidoo.com</a>, a Web site where users can share links and information about an idea or topic important to them.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Seth Godin","tags":["business","choice","culture","marketing","storytelling"],"title":"How to get your ideas to spread","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":5852994}]}
