											My title: &quot;Queerer than we can
suppose: the strangeness of science.&quot;
											&quot;Queerer than we can suppose&quot; comes
from J.B.S. Haldane, the famous biologist,
											who said, &quot;Now, my own suspicion
is that the universe is not only queerer
											than we suppose, but queerer
than we can suppose.
											I suspect that there are more things
in heaven and earth
											than are dreamed of, or can
be dreamed of, in any philosophy.&quot;
											Richard Feynman compared
the accuracy of quantum theories —
											experimental predictions —
											to specifying the width of North America
to within one hair&#39;s breadth of accuracy.
											This means that quantum theory
has got to be, in some sense, true.
											Yet the assumptions
that quantum theory needs to make
											in order to deliver those
predictions are so mysterious
											that even Feynman himself
was moved to remark,
											&quot;If you think you understand
quantum theory,
											you don&#39;t understand quantum theory.&quot;

									<p>
											It&#39;s so queer that physicists
resort to one or another
											paradoxical interpretation of it.
											David Deutsch, who&#39;s talking here,
in &quot;The Fabric of Reality,&quot;
											embraces the many-worlds
interpretation of quantum theory,
											because the worst that you
can say about it
											is that it&#39;s preposterously wasteful.
											It postulates a vast and rapidly growing
number of universes existing in parallel,
											mutually undetectable,
											except through the narrow porthole
of quantum mechanical experiments.
											And that&#39;s Richard Feynman.

											The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes
											that the queerness of modern physics
											is just an extreme example.
											Science, as opposed to technology,
											does violence to common sense.
											Every time you drink a glass
of water, he points out,
											the odds are that you will imbibe
at least one molecule
											that passed through the bladder
of Oliver Cromwell.
											(Laughter)
											It&#39;s just elementary probability theory.

											The number of molecules
per glassful is hugely greater
											than the number of glassfuls,
or bladdersful, in the world.
											And of course, there&#39;s nothing special
about Cromwell or bladders —
											you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom
											that passed through the right lung
of the third iguanodon
											to the left of the tall cycad tree.

											&quot;Queerer than we can suppose.&quot;
											What is it that makes us
capable of supposing anything,
											and does this tell us anything
about what we can suppose?
											Are there things about the universe
that will be forever beyond our grasp,
											but not beyond the grasp
of some superior intelligence?
											Are there things about the universe
											that are, in principle,
ungraspable by any mind,
											however superior?
											The history of science has been
one long series of violent brainstorms,
											as successive generations
have come to terms with
											increasing levels of queerness
in the universe.
											We&#39;re now so used to the idea
that the Earth spins,
											rather than the Sun moves across the sky,
											it&#39;s hard for us to realize
											what a shattering mental revolution
that must have been.
											After all, it seems obvious
that the Earth is large and motionless,
											the Sun, small and mobile.
											But it&#39;s worth recalling
Wittgenstein&#39;s remark on the subject:
											&quot;Tell me,&quot; he asked a friend,
&quot;why do people always say
											it was natural for man to assume
that the Sun went &#39;round the Earth,
											rather than that the Earth was rotating?&quot;
											And his friend replied, &quot;Well, obviously,
											because it just looks as though
the Sun is going round the Earth.&quot;
											Wittgenstein replied, &quot;Well,
what would it have looked like
											if it had looked as though
the Earth was rotating?&quot;

											Science has taught us,
against all intuition,
											that apparently solid things,
like crystals and rocks,
											are really almost entirely
composed of empty space.
											And the familiar illustration
is the nucleus of an atom
											is a fly in the middle
of a sports stadium,
											and the next atom
is in the next sports stadium.
											So it would seem the hardest,
solidest, densest rock
											is really almost entirely empty space,
											broken only by tiny particles
so widely spaced they shouldn&#39;t count.
											Why, then, do rocks look and feel
solid and hard and impenetrable?
											As an evolutionary biologist,
I&#39;d say this: our brains have evolved
											to help us survive within the orders
of magnitude, of size and speed
											which our bodies operate at.
											We never evolved to navigate
in the world of atoms.
											If we had, our brains
probably would perceive rocks
											as full of empty space.
											Rocks feel hard and impenetrable
											to our hands, precisely because
objects like rocks and hands
											cannot penetrate each other.
											It&#39;s therefore useful
											for our brains to construct notions
like &quot;solidity&quot; and &quot;impenetrability,&quot;
											because such notions help us
to navigate our bodies
											through the middle-sized world
in which we have to navigate.

											In a desert plain in Tanzania,
											in the shadow of the volcano
Ol Doinyo Lengai,
											there&#39;s a dune made of volcanic ash.
											The beautiful thing
is that it moves bodily.
											It&#39;s what&#39;s technically known
as a &quot;barchan,&quot;
											and the entire dune walks
across the desert in a westerly direction
											at a speed of about 17 meters per year.
											It retains its crescent shape and moves
in the direction of the horns.
											What happens is that the wind blows
the sand up the shallow slope
											on the other side,
											and then, as each sand grain hits
the top of the ridge, it cascades down
											on the inside of the crescent,
											and so the whole horn-shaped dune moves.
											Steve Grand points out

											more like a wave than a permanent thing.
											He invites us, the reader,

											something you remember clearly,

											The world model that a bat needs

											must be pretty similar to the world
model that any flying bird —

variables to its model,

light, is incidental.
											Bats, I&#39;ve even suggested, use
perceived hues, such as red and blue,

for some useful aspect of echoes —
											perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces,
furry or smooth and so on —
											in the same way as swallows or indeed,
we, use those perceived hues —

											The point is that the nature of the model

											J.B.S. Haldane himself had
something to say about animals

											Dogs can distinguish two very similar
fatty acids, extremely diluted:
											caprylic acid and caproic acid.
											The only difference, you see,
											is that one has an extra pair
of carbon atoms in the chain.
											Haldane guesses that a dog would probably
be able to place the acids
											in the order of their molecular
weights by their smells,
											just as a man could place
a number of piano wires
											in the order of their lengths
by means of their notes.
											Now, there&#39;s another
fatty acid, capric acid,
											which is just like the other two,
											except that it has two more carbon atoms.
											A dog that had never met
capric acid would, perhaps,
											have no more trouble imagining its smell
											than we would have trouble
imagining a trumpet, say,
											playing one note higher than we&#39;ve heard
a trumpet play before.
											Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other
smell-oriented animals smell in color.
											And the argument would be exactly

											Middle World — the range

cycle of counter-revenge,
											which we see, of course,
all over the world today.
											In short, when we&#39;re

											The reason we personify things
