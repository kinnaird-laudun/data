											There we were,
											souls and bodies packed
into a Texas church
											on the last night of our lives.
											Packed into a room just like this,
											but with creaky wooden pews
draped in worn-down red fabric,
											with an organ to my left
and a choir at my back
											and a baptism pool
built into the wall behind them.
											A room like this, nonetheless.
											With the same great feelings of suspense,
											the same deep hopes for salvation,

in the back not paying attention.

											This was December 31, 1999,

											and the end of the world as I knew it.
											I had turned 12 that year
											and had reached the age of accountability.
											And once I stopped complaining
											about how unfair it was
that Jesus would return
											as soon as I had to be accountable
for all that I had done,
											I figured I had better get
my house in order very quickly.

											I listened for silence as anxiously
as one might listen for noise,
											trying to be sure that the Lord
hadn&#39;t pulled a fast one on me
											and decided to come back early.

											And just in case he did,
											I built a backup plan,
											by reading the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books
that were all the rage at the time.
											And I found in their pages
											that if I was not taken
in the rapture at midnight,
											I had another shot.
											All I had to do was avoid
taking the mark of the beast,
											fight off demons, plagues
and the Antichrist himself.
