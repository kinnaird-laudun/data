<title>Bran Ferren: To create for the ages, let&#39;s combine art and engineering | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When Bran Ferren was just 9, his parents took him to see the Pantheon in Rome — and it changed everything. In that moment, he began to understand how the tools of science and engineering become more powerful when combined with art, with design and beauty. Ever since, he&#39;s been searching for a convincing modern-day equivalent to Rome&#39;s masterpiece. Stay tuned to the end of the talk for his unexpected suggestion." />

											Good morning.
											When I was a little boy,
											I had an experience that changed my life,
											and is in fact why I&#39;m here today.
											That one moment
											profoundly affected how I think about
											art, design and engineering.

											As background, I was fortunate enough to grow up
											in a family of loving and talented artists
											in one of the world&#39;s great cities.
											My dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15,
											was an artist by both passion and profession,
											as is my mom, Rae.
											He was one of the New York School
											abstract expressionists who,
											together with his contemporaries,
											invented American modern art,
											and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist
											towards modernism in the 20th century.
											Isn&#39;t it remarkable that, after thousands of years
											of people doing mostly representational art,
											that modern art, comparatively speaking,
											is about 15 minutes old,
											yet now pervasive.
											As with many other important innovations,
											those radical ideas required no new technology,
											just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment,
											plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism
											and rejection.
											In our home, art was everywhere.
											It was like oxygen,
											around us and necessary for life.
											As I watched him paint,
											Dad taught me that art
											was not about being decorative,
											but was a different way of communicating ideas,
											and in fact one that could bridge the worlds
											of knowledge and insight.

											Given this rich artistic environment,
											you&#39;d assume that I would have been compelled
											to go into the family business,
											but no.
											I followed the path of most kids
											who are genetically programmed
											to make their parents crazy.
											I had no interest in becoming an artist,
											certainly not a painter.
											What I did love was electronics and machines —
											taking them apart, building new ones,
											and making them work.
											Fortunately, my family also had engineers in it,
											and with my parents,
											these were my first role models.
											What they all had in common
											was they worked very, very hard.
											My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal
											kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn.
											On weekends, we would go
together to Cortlandt Street,
											which was New York City&#39;s radio row.
											There we would explore massive piles
											of surplus electronics,
											and for a few bucks bring home treasures
											like Norden bombsights
											and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers.
											I found these objects both useful and fascinating.
											I learned about engineering and how things worked,
											not at school
											but by taking apart and studying
											these fabulously complex devices.
											I did this for hours every day,
											apparently avoiding electrocution.
											Life was good.

									<p>
											However, every summer, sadly,
											the machines got left behind
											while my parents and I traveled overseas
											to experience history, art and design.
											We visited the great museums and historic buildings
											of both Europe and the Middle East,
											but to encourage my growing interest
											in science and technology,
											they would simply drop me off in places
											like the London Science Museum,
											where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself
											studying the history of science and technology.

											Then, when I was about nine years old,
											we went to Rome.
											On one particularly hot summer day,
											we visited a drum-shaped
building that from the outside
											was not particularly interesting.
											My dad said it was called the Pantheon,
											a temple for all of the gods.
											It didn&#39;t look all that special from the outside,
											as I said, but when we walked inside,
											I was immediately struck by three things:
											First of all, it was pleasantly cool
											despite the oppressive heat outside.
											It was very dark, the only source of light
											being an big open hole in the roof.
											Dad explained that this wasn&#39;t a big open hole,
											but it was called the oculus,
											an eye to the heavens.
											And there was something about this place,
											I didn&#39;t know why, that just felt special.
											As we walked to the center of the room,
											I looked up at the heavens through the oculus.
											This was the first church that I&#39;d been to
											that provided an unrestricted view
											between God and man.
											But I wondered, what about when it rained?
											Dad may have called this an oculus,
											but it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof.
											I looked down and saw floor drains
											had been cut into the stone floor.
											As I became more accustomed to the dark,
											I was able to make out details of the floor
											and the surrounding walls.
											No big deal here, just the same statuary stuff
											that we&#39;d seen all over Rome.
											In fact, it looked like the Appian Way
											marble salesman showed up
											with his sample book, showed it to Hadrian,
											and Hadrian said, &quot;We&#39;ll take all of it.&quot;
											(Laughter)

									<p>
											But the ceiling was amazing.
											It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.
											I&#39;d seen these before,
											and Bucky was friends with my dad.
											It was modern, high-tech, impressive,
											a huge 142-foot clear span
											which, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.
											I loved this place.
											It was really beautiful and unlike
anything I&#39;d ever seen before,
											so I asked my dad, &quot;When was this built?&quot;
											He said, &quot;About 2,000 years ago.&quot;
											And I said, &quot;No, I mean, the roof.&quot;
											You see, I assumed that this was a modern roof
											that had been put on because the original
											was destroyed in some long-past war.
											He said, &quot;It&#39;s the original roof.&quot;

											That moment changed my life,
											and I can remember it as if it were yesterday.
											For the first time, I realized people were smart
											2,000 years ago. (Laughter)
											This had never crossed my mind.
											I mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza,
											we visited those the year before,
											and sure they&#39;re impressive, nice enough design,
											but look, give me an unlimited budget,
											20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years
											to cut and drag stone blocks 
across the countryside,
											and I&#39;ll build you pyramids too.
											But no amount of brute force
											gets you the dome of the Pantheon,
											not 2,000 years ago, nor today.
											And incidentally, it is still the largest
											unreinforced concrete dome that&#39;s ever been built.
											To build the Pantheon took some miracles.
											By miracles, I mean things that are
											technically barely possible,
											very high-risk, and might not be
											actually accomplishable at this moment in time,
											certainly not by you.

									<p>
											For example, here are some
of the Pantheon&#39;s miracles.
											To make it even structurally possible,
											they had to invent super-strong concrete,
											and to control weight,
											varied the density of the aggregate
											as they worked their way up the dome.
											For strength and lightness, the dome structure
											used five rings of coffers,
											each of diminishing size,
											which imparts a dramatic forced perspective
											to the design.
											It was wonderfully cool inside
											because of its huge thermal mass,
											natural convection of air rising up
											through the oculus,
											and a Venturi effect when wind blows across
											the top of the building.
											I discovered for the first time that light itself
											has substance.
											The shaft of light beaming through the oculus
											was both beautiful and palpable,
											and I realized for the first time
											that light could be designed.
											Further, that of all of the forms of design,
											visual design,
											they were all kind of irrelevant without it,
											because without light, you can&#39;t see any of them.
											I also realized that I wasn&#39;t the first person
											to think that this place was really special.
											It survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers
											and the ravages of time to become
											what I believe is the longest
											continuously occupied building in history.

											Largely because of that visit,
											I came to understand that,
											contrary to what I was being told in school,
											the worlds of art and design
											were not, in fact, incompatible
											with science and engineering.
											I realized, when combined,
											you could create things that were amazing
											that couldn&#39;t be done in either domain alone.
											But in school, with few exceptions,
											they were treated as separate worlds,
											and they still are.
											My teachers told me that I had to get serious
											and focus on one or the other.
											However, urging me to specialize
											only caused me to really 
appreciate those polymaths
											like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,
											Benjamin Franklin,
											people who did exactly the opposite.
											And this led me to embrace
											and want to be in both worlds.

											So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity
											like the Pantheon actually happen?
											Someone themselves, perhaps Hadrian,
											needed a brilliant creative vision.
											They also needed the storytelling
and leadership skills
											necessary to fund and execute it,
											and a mastery of science and technology
											with the ability and knowhow
											to push existing innovations even farther.
											It is my belief that to create
these rare game changers
											requires you to pull off at least five miracles.
											The problem is, no matter how talented,
											rich or smart you are,
											you only get one to one and a half miracles.
											That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the quota.
											Then you run out of time, money, enthusiasm,
											whatever.
											Remember, most people can&#39;t even imagine
											one of these technical miracles,
											and you need at least five to make a Pantheon.
											In my experience, these rare visionaries
											who can think across the worlds of art,
											design and engineering
											have the ability to notice
											when others have provided enough of the miracles
											to bring the goal within reach.
											Driven by the clarity of their vision,
											they summon the courage and determination
											to deliver the remaining miracles
											and they often take what other people think to be
											insurmountable obstacles
											and turn them into features.
											Take the oculus of the Pantheon.
											By insisting that it be in the design,
											it meant you couldn&#39;t use much
of the structural technology
											that had been developed for Roman arches.
											However, by instead embracing it
											and rethinking weight and stress distribution,
											they came up with a design that only works
											if there&#39;s a big hole in the roof.
											That done, you now get the aesthetic
											and design benefits of light, cooling
											and that critical direct connection with the heavens.
											Not bad.
											These people not only believed
											that the impossible can be done,
											but that it must be done.

											Enough ancient history.
											What are some recent examples of innovations
											that combine creative design
											and technological advances in a way so profound
											that they will be remembered
											a thousand years from now?
											Well, putting a man on the moon was a good one,
											and returning him safely to Earth wasn&#39;t bad either.
											Talk about one giant leap:
											It&#39;s hard to imagine a more profound moment
											in human history
											than when we first left our world
											to set foot on another.

											So what came after the moon?
											One is tempted to say that today&#39;s pantheon
											is the Internet,
											but I actually think that&#39;s quite wrong,
											or at least it&#39;s only part of the story.
											The Internet isn&#39;t a Pantheon.
											It&#39;s more like the invention of concrete:
											important, absolutely necessary
											to build the Pantheon,
											and enduring,
											but entirely insufficient by itself.
											However, just as the technology of concrete
											was critical in realization of the Pantheon,
											new designers will use the
technologies of the Internet
											to create novel concepts that will endure.
											The smartphone is a perfect example.
											Soon the majority of people on the planet
											will have one,
											and the idea of connecting everyone
											to both knowledge and each other will endure.

											So what&#39;s next?
											What imminent advance will be
the equivalent of the Pantheon?
											Thinking about this,
											I rejected many very plausible
											and dramatic breakthroughs to come,
											such as curing cancer.
											Why? Because Pantheons are anchored
											in designed physical objects,
											ones that inspire by simply seeing
											and experiencing them,
											and will continue to do so indefinitely.
											It is a different kind of language, like art.
											These other vital contributions that extend life
											and relieve suffering are, of course, critical,
											and fantastic,
											but they&#39;re part of the continuum of
											our overall knowledge and technology,
											like the Internet.

									<p>
											So what is next?
											Perhaps counterintuitively,
											I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a visionary idea
											from the late 1930s
											that&#39;s been revived every decade since:
											autonomous vehicles.
											Now you&#39;re thinking, give me a break.
											How can a fancy version of cruise control
											be profound?
											Look, much of our world
											has been designed around 
roads and transportation.
											These were as essential to the success
											of the Roman Empire
											as the interstate highway system
											to the prosperity and development
											of the United States.
											Today, these roads that interconnect our world
											are dominated by cars and trucks
											that have remained largely unchanged
											for 100 years.
											Although perhaps not obvious today,
											autonomous vehicles will be the key technology
											that enables us to redesign our cities
											and, by extension, civilization.
											Here&#39;s why:
											Once they become ubiquitous,
											each year, these vehicles will save
											tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone
											and a million globally.
											Automotive energy consumption and air pollution
											will be cut dramatically.
											Much of the road congestion
											in and out of our cities will disappear.
											They will enable compelling new concepts
											in how we design cities, work,
											and the way we live.
											We will get where we&#39;re going faster
											and society will recapture vast amounts
											of lost productivity
											now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But why now? Why do we think this is ready?
											Because over the last 30 years,
											people from outside the automotive industry
											have spent countless billions
											creating the needed miracles,
											but for entirely different purposes.
											It took folks like DARPA, universities,
											and companies completely
outside of the automotive industry
											to notice that if you were clever about it,
											autonomy could be done now.
											So what are the five miracles
needed for autonomous vehicles?
											One, you need to know
											where you are and exactly what time it is.
											This was solved neatly by the GPS system,
											Global Positioning System,
											that the U.S. Government put in place.
											You need to know where all the roads are,
											what the rules are, and where you&#39;re going.
											The various needs of personal navigation systems,
											in-car navigation systems,
											and web-based maps address this.
											You must have near-continuous communication
											with high-performance computing networks
											and with others nearby
											to understand their intent.
											The wireless technologies
developed for mobile devices,
											with some minor modifications,
											are completely suitable to solve this.
											You&#39;ll probably want some restricted roadways
											to get started
											that both society and its lawyers
											agree are safe to use for this.
											This will start with the HOV lanes
											and move from there.
											But finally, you need to recognize
											people, signs and objects.
											Machine vision, special sensors,
and high-performance computing
											can do a lot of this,
											but it turns out a lot is not good enough
											when your family is on board.
											Occasionally, humans will 
need to do sense-making.
											For this, you might actually have to wake up
											your passenger and ask them what the hell
											that big lump is in the middle of the road.
											Not so bad, and it will give us a sense of purpose
											in this new world.
											Besides, once the first drivers explain
											to their confused car
											that the giant chicken at the fork in the road
											is actually a restaurant,
											and it&#39;s okay to keep driving,
											every other car on the surface of the Earth
											will know that from that point on.

											Five miracles, mostly delivered,
											and now you just need a clear vision
											of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles
											with seductively beautiful 
and new functional designs
											plus a lot of money and hard work
											to bring it home.
											The beginning is now only a handful of years away,
											and I predict that autonomous vehicles
											will permanently change our world

											In conclusion, I&#39;ve come to believe
											that the ingredients for the next Pantheons
											are all around us,
											just waiting for visionary people
											with the broad knowledge,
											multidisciplinary skills,
											and intense passion
											to harness them to make their dreams a reality.
											But these people don&#39;t spontaneously
											pop into existence.
											They need to be nurtured and encouraged
											from when they&#39;re little kids.
											We need to love them and help them
											discover their passions.
											We need to encourage them to work hard
											and help them understand that failure
											is a necessary ingredient for success,
											as is perseverance.
											We need to help them to find their own role models,
											and give them the confidence
to believe in themselves
											and to believe that anything is possible,
											and just as my grandpa did when
he took me shopping for surplus,
											and just as my parents did
											when they took me to science museums,
											we need to encourage them to find their own path,
											even if it&#39;s very different from our own.

											But a cautionary note:
											We also need to periodically pry them away
											from their modern miracles,
											the computers, phones, tablets,
											game machines and TVs,
											take them out into the sunlight
											so they can experience both the natural
											and design wonders of our world,
											our planet and our civilization.
											If we don&#39;t, they won&#39;t understand
											what these precious things are
											that someday they will be resopnsible
											for protecting and improving.
											We also need them to understand
											something that doesn&#39;t seem adequately appreciated
											in our increasingly tech-dependent world,
											that art and design
											are not luxuries,
											nor somehow incompatible
											with science and engineering.
											They are in fact essential to what makes us special.
