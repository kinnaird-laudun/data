											So I&#39;m here to talk to you
about the walkable city.
											What is the walkable city?
											Well, for want of a better definition,
											it&#39;s a city in which the car
is an optional instrument of freedom,
											rather than a prosthetic device.
											And I&#39;d like to talk about
why we need the walkable city,
											and I&#39;d like to talk about
how to do the walkable city.

											Most of the talks I give these days
are about why we need it,
											but you guys are smart.
											And also I gave that talk
exactly a month ago,
											and you can see it at TED.com.
											So today I want to talk
about how to do it.
											In a lot of time thinking about this,
											I&#39;ve come up with what I call
the general theory of walkability.
											A bit of a pretentious term,
it&#39;s a little tongue-in-cheek,
											but it&#39;s something
I&#39;ve thought about for a long time,
											and I&#39;d like to share
what I think I&#39;ve figured out.

											In the American city,
the typical American city —
											the typical American city
is not Washington, DC,
											or New York, or San Francisco;
											it&#39;s Grand Rapids or Cedar
Rapids or Memphis —
											in the typical American city
in which most people own cars
											and the temptation
is to drive them all the time,
											if you&#39;re going to get them to walk,
then you have to offer a walk
											that&#39;s as good as a drive or better.
											What does that mean?
											It means you need to offer
four things simultaneously:
											there needs to be a proper reason to walk,
											the walk has to be safe and feel safe,
											the walk has to be comfortable
											and the walk has to be interesting.
											You need to do all four
of these things simultaneously,
											and that&#39;s the structure of my talk today,
											to take you through each of those.

											The reason to walk
is a story I learned from my mentors,
											Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,
											the founders of the New Urbanism movement.
											And I should say half the slides
and half of my talk today
											I learned from them.
											It&#39;s the story of planning,
											the story of the formation
of the planning profession.
											When in the 19th century
people were choking
											from the soot of the dark, satanic mills,
											the planners said, hey, let&#39;s move
the housing away from the mills.
											And lifespans increased
immediately, dramatically,
											and we like to say
											the planners have been trying to repeat
that experience ever since.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So there&#39;s the onset
of what we call Euclidean zoning,
											the separation of the landscape
into large areas of single use.
											And typically when I arrive
in a city to do a plan,
											a plan like this already awaits me
on the property that I&#39;m looking at.
											And all a plan like this guarantees
											is that you will not have a walkable city,
											because nothing is located
near anything else.
											The alternative, of course,
is our most walkable city,
											and I like to say, you know,
this is a Rothko,
											and this is a Seurat.
											It&#39;s just a different way —
he was the pointilist —
											it&#39;s a different way of making places.
											And even this map of Manhattan
is a bit misleading
											because the red color
is uses that are mixed vertically.

									<p>
											So this is the big story
of the New Urbanists —
											to acknowledge
that there are only two ways
											that have been tested by the thousands
											to build communities,
in the world and throughout history.
											One is the traditional neighborhood.
											You see here several neighborhoods
of Newburyport, Massachusetts,
											which is defined as being compact
and being diverse —
											places to live, work, shop,
recreate, get educated —
											all within walking distance.
											And it&#39;s defined as being walkable.
											There are lots of small streets.
											Each one is comfortable to walk on.
											And we contrast that to the other way,
											an invention that happened
after the Second World War,
											suburban sprawl,
											clearly not compact, clearly not diverse,
and it&#39;s not walkable,
											because so few of the streets connect,
											that those streets that do connect
become overburdened,
											and you wouldn&#39;t let your kid out on them.
											And I want to thank Alex Maclean,
the aerial photographer,
											for many of these beautiful pictures
that I&#39;m showing you today.

									<p>
											So it&#39;s fun to break sprawl down
into its constituent parts.
											It&#39;s so easy to understand,
											the places where you only live,
the places where you only work,

of the parking lot

											tells you all you need to know,

											Then the final part of sprawl
that everyone forgot to count:
											if you&#39;re going to separate everything
from everything else
											and reconnect it
only with automotive infrastructure,
											then this is what your landscape
begins to look like.
											The main message here is:

											This is the outcome
of that form of design,

of the New Urbanism now

neighborhood contain the same things.

											So when we look at a downtown area,
											at a place that has a hope
of being walkable,
											and mostly that&#39;s our downtowns
in America&#39;s cities
											and towns and villages,
											we look at them and say
we want the proper balance of uses.
											So what is missing or underrepresented?
											And again, in the typical American cities
in which most Americans live,
											it is housing that is lacking.
											The jobs-to-housing balance is off.
											And you find that when
you bring housing back,
											these other things start to come back too,
											and housing is usually first
among those things.
											And, of course, the thing
that shows up last and eventually
											is the schools,
											because the people have to move in,
											the young pioneers have to move in,
get older, have kids
											and fight, and then the schools
get pretty good eventually.

											The other part of this part,
											the useful city part,
											is transit,
											and you can have a perfectly
walkable neighborhood without it.
											But perfectly walkable cities
require transit,
											because if you don&#39;t have access
to the whole city as a pedestrian,
											then you get a car,
											and if you get a car,
											the city begins to reshape itself
around your needs,
											and the streets get wider
and the parking lots get bigger
											and you no longer have a walkable city.
											So transit is essential.
											But every transit experience,
every transit trip,
											begins or ends as a walk,
											and so we have to remember to build
walkability around our transit stations.

											The first is block size.
											This is Portland, Oregon,
											famously 200-foot blocks,
famously walkable.
											This is Salt Lake City,
											famously 600-foot blocks,
											famously unwalkable.
											If you look at the two,
it&#39;s almost like two different planets,
											but these places were both built by humans
											and in fact, the story is that when
you have a 200-foot block city,
											you can have a two-lane city,
											or a two-to-four lane city,
											and a 600-foot block city
is a six-lane city, and that&#39;s a problem.
											These are the crash statistics.
											When you double the block size —

of 24 California cities —

the number of fatal accidents

											So how many lanes do we have?
											This is where I&#39;m going to tell you
what I tell every audience I meet,
											which is to remind you
about induced demand.
											Induced demand applies
both to highways and to city streets.
											And induced demand tells us
that when we widen the streets
											to accept the congestion
that we&#39;re anticipating,
											or the additional trips
that we&#39;re anticipating
											in congested systems,
it is principally that congestion
											that is constraining demand,
											and so that the widening comes,
											and there are all of these latent trips
that are ready to happen.
											People move further from work
											and make other choices
about when they commute,
											and those lanes fill up
very quickly with traffic,
											so we widen the street again,
and they fill up again.
											And we&#39;ve learned that
in congested systems,
											we cannot satisfy the automobile.

											This is from Newsweek Magazine —
hardly an esoteric publication:
											&quot;Today&#39;s engineers acknowledge

usually makes traffic worse.&quot;
											My response to reading this was,
may I please meet some of these engineers,

											there are great exceptions
that I&#39;m working with now —
											but these are not the engineers
one typically meets working in a city,

is too crowded, we need to add a lane.&quot;
											So you add a lane, and the traffic comes,

we needed that lane.&quot;

											But the amazing thing
about most American cities that I work in,
											the more typical cities,
											is that they have a lot of streets
that are actually oversized
											for the congestion
they&#39;re currently experiencing.
											This was the case in Oklahoma City,
											when the mayor came running
to me, very upset,
											because they were named
in Prevention Magazine
											the worst city for pedestrians
in the entire country.
											Now that can&#39;t possibly be true,
											but it certainly is enough
to make a mayor do something about it.
											We did a walkability study,
											and what we found, looking
at the car counts on the street —
											these are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car counts
											and we know that two lanes
can handle 10,000 cars per day.
											Look at these numbers —
they&#39;re all near or under 10,000 cars,
											and these were the streets
that were designated
											in the new downtown plan
											to be four lanes to six lanes wide.
											So you had a fundamental disconnect
between the number of lanes
											and the number of cars
that wanted to use them.

											So it was my job to redesign
every street in the downtown
											from curb face to curb face,
											and we did it for 50 blocks of streets,
											and we&#39;re rebuilding it now.
											So a typical oversized street to nowhere
											is being narrowed, and now
under construction,
											and the project is half done.
											The typical street like this, you know,
											when you do that,
you find room for medians.
											You find room for bike lanes.
											We&#39;ve doubled the amount
of on-street parking.
											We&#39;ve added a full bike network

											But not everyone has the money
that Oklahoma City has,
											because they have an extraction
economy that&#39;s doing quite well.
											The typical city is more
like Cedar Rapids,
											where they have an all four-lane
system, half one-way system.
											And it&#39;s a little hard to see,
											but what we&#39;ve done — what we&#39;re doing;
it&#39;s in process right now,
											it&#39;s in engineering right now —
											is turning an all four-lane
system, half one-way
											into an all two-lane system, all two-way,
											and in so doing, we&#39;re adding
70 percent more on-street parking,
											which the merchants love,
											and it protects the sidewalk.
											That parking makes the sidewalk safe,

robust bicycle network.

											The standards have changed
to such a degree

that wasn&#39;t draining properly,
											they had to widen it
and take away half our sidewalk,

											Now: bicycles.

are the current revolution underway
											in only some American cities.
											But where you build it, they come.
											As a planner, I hate to say that,
but the one thing I can say
											is that bicycle population
is a function of bicycle infrastructure.
											I asked my friend Tom Brennan

of bikers in it several times now
											by painting these bright green lanes.
											Even automotive cities
like Long Beach, California:
											vast uptick in the number of bikers
based on the infrastructure.
											And of course, what really does it,
											if you know 15th Street
here in Washington, DC —
											please meet Rahm Emanuel&#39;s
new bike lanes in Chicago,
											the buffered lane, the parallel parking
pulled off the curb,
											the bikes between the parked
cars and the curb —

slow cars down.
											They move slower when trees
are next to the road,
											and, of course, sometimes
they slow down very quickly.
											All the little details —
the curb return radius.
											Is it one foot or is it 40 feet?
											How swoopy is that curb to determine
how fast the car goes
											and how much room you have to cross.

											So then quickly, the comfortable walk
has to do with the fact
											that all animals seek, simultaneously,
prospect and refuge.
											We want to be able to see our predators,
											but we also want to feel
that our flanks are covered.
											And so we&#39;re drawn to places
that have good edges,
											and if you don&#39;t supply the edges,
people won&#39;t want to be there.
											What&#39;s the proper ratio
of height to width?
											Is it one to one? Three to one?
											If you get beyond one to six,
you&#39;re not very comfortable anymore.
											You don&#39;t feel enclosed.

because of an outdated zoning code,
											then you could have a missing nose
in your neighborhood.

I couldn&#39;t build on that site.
											As you may know, Washington, DC

to become sites like this.
