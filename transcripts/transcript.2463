											Someday, we may have robots
as smart as people,
											artificial intelligence, AI.
											How could that happen?
											One route is that we&#39;ll just keep
accumulating better software,
											like we&#39;ve been doing for 70 years.
											At past rates of progress,
that may take centuries.
											Some say it&#39;ll happen a lot faster
											as we discover grand new
powerful theories of intelligence.
											I&#39;m skeptical.

											But a third scenario
											is what I&#39;m going to talk about today.
											The idea is to port the software
from the human brain.
											To do this, we&#39;re going to need
three technologies to be good enough,
											and none of them are there yet.
											First, we&#39;re going to need
lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.
											Second, we&#39;re going to need
to scan individual human brains
											in fine spatial and chemical detail,
											to see exactly what cells are where,
connected to what, of what type.
											And third, we&#39;re going to need
computer models
											of how each kind of brain cell works —
											taking input signals,
changing interval state
											and sending output signals.
											If we have good enough models
of all the kinds of brain cells
											and a good enough model of the brain,
											we can put it together to make
a good enough model of an entire brain,
											and that model would have the same
input-output behavior as the original.
											So if you talk to it, it might talk back.
											If you ask it to do things,
it might do them.
											And if we could do that,
everything would change.

											People have been talking
about this idea for decades,

											When they talk about it, they say,
											&quot;Is this even possible?
											If you made one, would it be conscious?
Or is it just an empty machine?
											If you made one of me,
is that me or someone else?&quot;

											OK, the first thing I can tell you
											is that ems spend most
of their life in virtual reality.
											This is what you might look like
if you were using virtual reality.
											And this is what you might see:
											sunlight glinting off of water,
you might hear gulls flying above,
											you might even feel the wind
on your cheeks or smell seawater,
											with advanced hardware.
											Now, if you were to spend
a lot of time here,
											you might want a dashboard
											where you could do things like
make a phone call,
											move to a new virtual world,
											check your bank account.

											Now, while this is what
you would look like in virtual reality,
											this is what an em
would look like in virtual reality.
											It&#39;s computer hardware
sitting in a server rack somewhere.
											But still, it could see
and experience the same thing.
											But some things are different for ems.
											First, while you&#39;ll probably always notice
that virtual reality isn&#39;t entirely real,
											to an em, it can feel as real to them
as this room feels to you now
											or as anything ever feels.
											And ems also have
some more action possibilities.

									<p>
											For example, your mind just always
runs at the same speed,
											but an em can add more or less
computer hardware to run faster or slower,
											and therefore, if the world around them
seems to be going too fast,
											they can just speed up their mind,
											and the world around them
would seem to slow down.

											In addition, an em can make
a copy of itself at that moment.
											This copy would remember
everything the same,
											and if it starts out with the same speed,
looking at the same speed,
											it might even need to be told,
&quot;You are the copy.&quot;
											And em could make archive copies,
											and with enough archives,
											an em can be immortal —
											in principle, though not
usually in practice.
											And an em can move its brain,
the computer that represents its brain,
											from one physical location to another.
											Ems can actually move around the world
at the speed of light,
											and by moving to a new location,
											they can interact more quickly
with ems near that new location.

											So far, I&#39;ve been talking about
what ems can do.
											What do ems choose to do?
											To understand that, we&#39;ll need
to understand three key facts.
											First, ems by definition do what
the human they emulate would do
											in the same situation.
											So their lives and behavior
are very human.
											They&#39;re mainly different because
they&#39;re living in a different world.
											Second, ems need
real resources to survive.
											You need food and shelter or you&#39;ll die.
											Also, ems need computer hardware,
energy, cooling, or they can&#39;t exist.
											For every subjective minute
that an em experiences,
											someone, usually that em,
had to work to pay for it.
											Third, ems are poor.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The em population can grow
quicker than the em economy,
											so that means wages fall down
to em subsistence levels.
											That means ems have to be working
most of the time.
											So that means
this is what ems usually see:
											beautiful and luxurious, but desks —
											they&#39;re working most of the time.
											Now, a subsistence wage scenario,
you might think, is exotic and strange,
											but it&#39;s actually the usual case
in human history,
											and it&#39;s how pretty much
all wild animals have ever lived,
											so we know what humans do
in this situation.
											Humans basically do
what it takes to survive,
											and this is what lets me say
so much about the em world.
											When creatures are rich, like you,
											you have to know a lot
about what they want
											to figure out what they do.
											When creatures are poor,
											you know that they mostly do
what it takes to survive.

									<p>
											So we&#39;ve been talking about the em world
from the point of view of the ems —
											now, let&#39;s step back
and look at their whole world.
											First, the em world grows
much faster than ours,
											roughly a hundred times faster.
											So the amount of change
we would experience in a century or two,
											they would experience in a year or two.
											And I&#39;m not really willing to project
this age much beyond that,
											because plausibly by then something else
will happen, I don&#39;t know what.
											Second, the typical emulation
runs even faster,
											roughly a thousand times human speed.
											So for them, they experience
thousands of years in this year or two,
											and for them, the world around them
is actually changing more slowly
											than your world seems to change for you.
											Third, ems are crammed together
in a small number of very dense cities.
											This is not only how they see
themselves in virtual reality,
											it&#39;s also how they actually are
physically crammed together.
											So at em speeds, physical travel
feels really painfully slow,
											so most em cities are self-sufficient,
											most war is cyber war,
											and most of the rest of the earth
away from the em cities
											is left to the humans, because the ems
really aren&#39;t that interested in it.

									<p>
											Speaking of humans,
											you were wanting to hear about that.
											Humans must retire, at once, for good.
											They just can&#39;t compete.
											Now, humans start out owning
all of the capital in this world.
											The economy grows very fast,
their wealth grows very fast.
											Humans get rich, collectively.
											As you may know, most humans today
don&#39;t actually own that much
											besides their ability to work,
											so between now and then,
they need to acquire sufficient assets,
											insurance or sharing arrangements,
											or they may starve.
											I highly recommend avoiding this outcome.

and take their stuff.

											In part, that&#39;s because it would disrupt
the institutions we share with them.
											Other groups would wonder who&#39;s next,
											so plausibly, ems may well let humans
retire in peace during the age of em.
											You should worry more that
the age of em only lasts a year or two

											Ems are very much like humans,
											but they are not like the typical human.
											The typical em is a copy
of the few hundred most productive humans.
											So in fact, they are as elite,
compared to the typical human,
											as the typical billionaire,
Nobel Prize winner,
											Olympic gold medalist, head of state.
											Ems look on humans
perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude,
											but not so much respect,
											which is, if you think about it,
how you think about your ancestors.
											We know many things about how humans
differ in terms of productivity.
											We can just use those
to predict features of ems —
											for example, they tend to be smart,
conscientious, hard-working,
											married, religious, middle-aged.
											These are features of ems.

											Em world also contains enormous variety.
											Not only does it continue on with most
of the kinds of variety that humans do,
											including variety of industry
and profession,
											they also have many new kinds of variety,
											and one of the most important
is mind speed.
											Ems can plausibly go from human speed
											up to a million times
faster than human speed,
											and down to a billion times
slower than human speed.
											Faster ems tend to have
markers of high status.
											They embody more wealth.
They win arguments.
											They sit at premium locations.
											Slower ems are mostly retirees,
											and they are like the ghosts
of our literature.
											If you recall, ghosts are all around us —
											you can interact with them
if you pay the price.
											But they don&#39;t know much,
they can&#39;t influence much,
											and they&#39;re obsessed with the past,
so what&#39;s the point?

those short term versions in a moment,

											because they don&#39;t have to rest

A pioneer in prediction markets, also known as information markets and idea futures, Hanson has been known since the 1980s for taking the very very long view on topics as varied as (a selected list) spatial product competition, health incentive contracts, group insurance, product bans, evolutionary psychology and bioethics of health care, voter information incentives, incentives to fake expertise, Bayesian classification, agreeing to disagree, self-deception in disagreement, probability elicitation, wiretaps, image reconstruction, the history of science prizes, reversible computation, the origin of life, the survival of humanity, very long term economic growth, growth given machine intelligence and interstellar colonization.</p><p>Meanwhile, he has developed new technologies for conditional, combinatorial and intermediated trading, and he studied insider trading, manipulation and other foul play. Hanson is associate professor of economics at George Mason University&nbsp;and a research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University.
