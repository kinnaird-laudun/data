<title>Shimon Schocken: The self-organizing computer course | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan developed a curriculum for their students to build a computer, piece by piece. When they put the course online -- giving away the tools, simulators, chip specifications and other building blocks -- they were surprised that thousands jumped at the opportunity to learn, working independently as well as organizing their own classes in the first Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). A call to forget about grades and tap into the self-motivation to learn." />

											So, this is my grandfather,
											Salman Schocken,
											who was born into a poor and uneducated family
											with six children to feed,
											and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to
											drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table.
											He never went back to school.
											Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire
											of department stores.
											Salman was the consummate perfectionist,
											and every one of his stores was a jewel
											of Bauhaus architecture.
											He was also the ultimate self-learner,
											and like everything else, he did it in grand style.
											He surrounded himself with an entourage
											of young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber
											and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka,
											and he paid each one of them a monthly salary
											so that they could write in peace.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And yet, in the late &#39;30s, Salman saw what&#39;s coming.
											He fled Germany, together with his family,
											leaving everything else behind.
											His department stores confiscated,
											he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit
											of art and culture.
											This high school dropout
											died at the age of 82,
											a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO
											of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
											and founder of Schocken Books,
											an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired
											by Random House.
											Such is the power of self-study.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And these are my parents.
											They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.
											They were too busy building a family and a country.
											And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong,
											tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked
											with thousands of books, records and artwork.
											I remember quite vividly my father telling me
											that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set,
											then we&#39;ll buy a normal F.M. radio. (Laughter)

									<p>
											And that&#39;s me,
											I was going to say holding my first abacus,
											but actually holding what my father would consider
											an ample substitute to an iPad. (Laughter)
											So one thing that I took from home is this notion
											that educators don&#39;t necessarily have to teach.
											Instead, they can provide an environment and resources
											that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own.
											Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment:
											these are the virtues of a great education.

									<p>
											So I&#39;d like to share with you a story about a self-study,
											self-empowering computer science course
											that I built, together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan.
											As you can see from the pictures, both Noam and I
											had an early fascination with first principles,
											and over the years, as our knowledge of
											science and technology became more sophisticated,
											this early awe with the basics
											has only intensified.
											So it&#39;s not surprising that, about 12 years ago, when
											Noam and I were already computer science professors,
											we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon.
											As computers became increasingly more complex,
											our students were losing the forest for the trees,
											and indeed, it is impossible to connect
											with the soul of the machine if you interact
											with a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded
											by numerous layers of closed, proprietary software.
											So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students
											to understand how computers work,
											and understand it in the marrow of their bones,
											then perhaps the best way to go about it
											is to have them build a complete, working,
											general-purpose, useful computer, hardware and software,
											from the ground up, from first principles.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, we had to start somewhere, and so Noam and I
											decided to base our cathedral, so to speak,
											on the simplest possible building block,
											which is something called NAND.
											It is nothing more than a trivial logic gate
											with four input-output states.
											So we now start this journey by telling our students
											that God gave us NAND — (Laughter) —
											and told us to build a computer, and when we asked how,
											God said, &quot;One step at a time.&quot;
											And then, following this advice, we start
											with this lowly, humble NAND gate,
											and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence
											of projects in which they gradually build a chip set,
											a hardware platform, an assembler, a virtual machine,
											a basic operating system and a compiler
											for a simple, Java-like language that we call &quot;JACK.&quot;
											The students celebrate the end of this tour de force
											by using JACK to write all sorts of cool games
											like Pong, Snake and Tetris.
											You can imagine the tremendous joy of playing
											with a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK
											and then compiled into machine language in a compiler
											that you wrote also, and then seeing the result
											running on a machine that you built starting
											with nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates.
											It&#39;s a tremendous personal triumph of going
											from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex
											and useful system.

											Noam and I worked five years to facilitate
											this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure
											that will enable students to build it in one semester.
											And this is the great team that helped us make it happen.
											The trick was to decompose the computer&#39;s construction
											into numerous stand-alone modules,
											each of which could be individually specified,
											built and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project.
											And from day one, Noam and I decided to put
											all these building blocks freely available in open source
											on the Web.
											So chip specifications, APIs, project descriptions,
											software tools, hardware simulators, CPU emulators,
											stacks of hundreds of slides, lectures —
											we laid out everything on the Web
											and invited the world to come over,
											take whatever they need,
											and do whatever they want with it.

									<p>
											And then something fascinating happened.
											The world came.
											And in short order, thousands of people
											were building our machine.
											And NAND2Tetris became one of the first
											massive, open, online courses,
											although seven years ago we had no idea that what
											we were doing is called MOOCs.
											We just observed how self-organized courses
											were kind of spontaneously spawning
											out of our materials.
											For example, Pramode C.E.,
											an engineer from Kerala, India,
											has organized groups of self-learners
											who build our computer under his good guidance.
											And Parag Shah, another engineer, from Mumbai,
											has unbundled our projects into smaller,
											more manageable bites that he now serves
											in his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The people who are attracted to these courses
											typically have a hacker mentality.
											They want to figure out how things work,
											and they want to do it in groups,
											like this hackers club in Washington, D.C.,
											that uses our materials to offer community courses.
											And because these materials are widely available
											and open-source, different people take them
											to very different and unpredictable directions.
											For example, Yu Fangmin, from Guangzhou,
											has used FPGA technology
											to build our computer and show others how to do the same
											using a video clip, and Ben Craddock developed
											a very nice computer game that unfolds
											inside our CPU architecture, which is quite a complex
											3D maze that Ben developed
											using the Minecraft 3D simulator engine.
											The Minecraft community went bananas over this project,
											and Ben became an instant media celebrity.

											And indeed, for quite a few people,
											taking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will,
											has turned into a life-changing experience.
											For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music
											and math major from East Lansing, Michigan.
											A few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post
											on our website, and I&#39;d like to read it to you.
											So here&#39;s what Dan said.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											&quot;I did the coursework because understanding computers
											is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy,
											and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything,
											never been challenged to this degree.
											But given what I now feel capable of doing,
											I would certainly do it again.
											To anyone considering NAND2Tetris,
											it&#39;s a tough journey, but you&#39;ll be profoundly changed.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So Dan demonstrates the many self-learners
											who take this course off the Web, on their own traction,
											on their own initiative, and it&#39;s quite amazing because
											these people cannot care less about
											grades.
											They are doing it because of one motivation only.
											They have a tremendous passion to learn.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And with that in mind,
											I&#39;d like to say a few words about traditional college grading.
											I&#39;m sick of it.
											We are obsessed with grades
											because we are obsessed with data,
											and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing,
											and a huge part of education
											is about failing.
											Courage, according to Churchill,
											is the ability to go from one defeat to another
											without losing enthusiasm. (Laughter)
											And [Joyce] said that mistakes
											are the portals of discovery.
											And yet we don&#39;t tolerate mistakes,
											and we worship grades.
											So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses
											and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4,
											which is stamped on your forehead
											and sums up who you are.
											Well, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense,
											and grading became degrading.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So with that, I&#39;d like to say a few words about upgrading,
											and share with you a glimpse from my current project,
											which is different from the previous one,
											but it shares exactly the same characteristics
											of self-learning, learning by doing,
											self-exploration and community-building,
											and this project deals with K-12 math education,
											beginning with early age math,
											and we do it on tablets because we believe that
											math, like anything else, should be taught hands on.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So here&#39;s what we do. Basically, we developed
											numerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining
											a particular concept in math.
											So for example, let&#39;s take area.
											When you deal with a concept like area —
											well, we also provide a set of tools that the child
											is invited to experiment with in order to learn.
											So if area is what interests us, then one thing
											which is natural to do is to tile the area
											of this particular shape and simply count
											how many tiles it takes to cover it completely.
											And this little exercise here gives you a first
											good insight of the notion of area.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Moving along, what about the area of this figure?
											Well, if you try to tile it, it doesn&#39;t work too well, does it.
											So instead, you can experiment
											with these different tools here by some process
											of guided trial and error,
											and at some point you will discover that one thing
											that you can do among several legitimate transformations
											is the following one. You can cut the figure,
											you can rearrange the parts, you can glue them
											and then proceed to tile just like we did before.
											(Applause)
											Now this particular transformation
											did not change the area of the original figure,
											so a six-year-old who plays with this
											has just discovered a clever algorithm
											to compute the area of any given parallelogram.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We don&#39;t replace teachers, by the way.
											We believe that teachers should be empowered, not replaced.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Moving along, what about the area of a triangle?
											So after some guided trial and error,
											the child will discover, with or without help,
											that he or she can duplicate the original figure
											and then take the result, transpose it,
											glue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before:
											cut, rearrange, paste — oops— paste and glue,
											and tile.
											Now this transformation has doubled the area
											of the original figure, and therefore we have just learned
											that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle
											divided by two.
											But we discovered it by self-exploration.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, in addition to learning some useful geometry,
											the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated
											science strategies, like reduction,
											which is the art of
											transforming a complex problem into a simple one,
											or generalization, which is at the heart
											of any scientific discipline,
											or the fact that some properties are invariant
											under some transformations.
											And all this is something that a very young child
											can pick up using such mobile apps.
											So presently, we are doing the following:
											First of all, we are decomposing the K-12 math curriculum
											into numerous such apps.
											And because we cannot do it on our own,
											we&#39;ve developed a very fancy authoring tool
											that any author, any parent or actually anyone
											who has an interest in math education,
											can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps
											on tablets without programming.
											And finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem
											that will match different learners
											with different apps according to their evolving learning style.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The driving force behind this project
											is my colleague Shmulik London,
											and, you see, just like
											Salman did about 90 years ago,
											the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people,
											because at the end,
											it&#39;s all about people.
											And a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv
											and I saw this graffiti on a wall,
											and I found it so compelling
											that by now I preach it to my students,
											and I&#39;d like to try to preach it to you.
											Now, I don&#39;t know how many people here are familiar
											with the term &quot;mensch.&quot;
											It basically means to be human
											and to do the right thing.
											And with that, what this graffiti says is,
											&quot;High-tech schmigh-tech.
											The most important thing is to be a mensch.&quot; (Laughter)
											Thank you. (Applause)

He&#39;s also taught at NYU, Harvard and Stanford. Together with Noam Nisan he developed a freely available, open-source, self-paced program for learning applied computer science: <a href=\"http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/\" target=\"_blank\">The Elements of Computing Systems</a>. Offered in 2005, this led to one of the first successful open online courses. Now, courses based on the approach are offered by traditional universities as well as in crowd-sourced settings, and have been taken freely by thousands of self-learners over the web. Registration, lecture and project schedules are managed by volunteer course coordinators, and student questions are answered by the course alumni community. </p><p><br />His current project focuses on developing instructional materials for early-age math education, which he thinks can be transformed using low-cost tablet computers. He uses his other life passion, mountain biking, to teach adolescent  boys in Israelʼs juvenile detention centers valuable life lessons  through challenging bike rides in remote locations.
