											For a long time,
											there was me, and my body.
											Me was composed of stories,
											of cravings, of strivings,
											of desires of the future.
											Me was trying
											not to be an outcome of my violent past,
											but the separation that had already occurred
											between me and my body
											was a pretty significant outcome.
											Me was always trying to become something, somebody.
											Me only existed in the trying.
											My body was often in the way.

											Me was a floating head.
											For years, I actually only wore hats.
											It was a way of keeping my head attached.
											It was a way of locating myself.
											I worried that [if] I took my hat off
											I wouldn&#39;t be here anymore.
											I actually had a therapist who once said to me,
											&quot;Eve, you&#39;ve been coming here for two years,
											and, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body.&quot;
											All this time I lived in the city
											because, to be honest,
											I was afraid of trees.
											I never had babies
											because heads cannot give birth.
											Babies actually don&#39;t come out of your mouth.

											As I had no reference point for my body,
											I began to ask other women about their bodies —
											in particular, their vaginas,
											because I thought vaginas were kind of important.
											This led to me writing &quot;The Vagina Monologues,&quot;
											which led to me obsessively and incessantly
											talking about vaginas everywhere I could.
											I did this in front of many strangers.
											One night on stage,
											I actually entered my vagina.
											It was an ecstatic experience.
											It scared me, it energized me,
											and then I became a driven person,
											a driven vagina.

											I began to see my body like a thing,

											many things, all at once.
											I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.
											I would drive it and demand things from it.
											It had no limits. It was invincible.
											It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.
											I didn&#39;t heed it;
											no, I organized it and I directed it.
											I didn&#39;t have patience for my body;
											I snapped it into shape.
											I was greedy.
											I took more than my body had to offer.
											If I was tired, I drank more espressos.
											If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places.

											Oh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body,

											can sometimes have a moment of kindness.
											My father was really kind to me
											on my 16th birthday, for example.
											I heard people murmur from time to time
											that I should love my body,
											so I learned how to do this.
											I was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn&#39;t smoke.
											But all that was just a more sophisticated way
											to manipulate my body —
											a further disassociation,
											like planting a vegetable field on a freeway.

											As a result of me talking so much about my vagina,
											many women started to tell me about theirs —
											their stories about their bodies.
											Actually, these stories compelled me around the world,
											and I&#39;ve been to over 60 countries.
											I heard thousands of stories,
											and I have to tell you, there was always this moment
											where the women shared with me
											that particular moment when she separated from her body —
											when she left home.
											I heard about women being molested in their beds,
											flogged in their burqas,
											left for dead in parking lots,
											acid burned in their kitchens.
											Some women became quiet and disappeared.
											Other women became mad, driven machines like me.

											In the middle of my traveling,
											I turned 40 and I began to hate my body,
											which was actually progress,
											because at least my body existed enough to hate it.
											Well my stomach — it was my stomach I hated.
											It was proof that I had not measured up,
											that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect
											or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.
											My stomach was proof that I had failed,
											that it had failed me, that it was broken.
											My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it.
											In fact, it became so extreme
											I wrote a play about it.
											But the more I talked about it,
											the more objectified and fragmented my body became.
											It became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity,
											something I was selling.

											Then I went somewhere else.
											I went outside
											what I thought I knew.
											I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
											And I heard stories
											that shattered all the other stories.
											I heard stories
											that got inside my body.
											I heard about a little girl
											who couldn&#39;t stop peeing on herself
											because so many grown soldiers
											had shoved themselves inside her.
											I heard an 80-year-old woman
											whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets
											and twisted up on her head
											as the soldiers raped her like that.
											There are thousands of these stories,
											and many of the women had holes in their bodies —
											holes, fistula —
											that were the violation of war —
											holes in the fabric of their souls.
											These stories saturated my cells and nerves,
											and to be honest,
											I stopped sleeping for three years.

											All the stories began to bleed together.
											The raping of the Earth,
											the pillaging of minerals,
											the destruction of vaginas —
											none of these were separate anymore
											from each other or me.
											Militias were raping six-month-old babies
											so that countries far away
											could get access to gold and coltan
											for their iPhones and computers.
											My body had not only become a driven machine,
											but it was responsible now
											for destroying other women&#39;s bodies
											in its mad quest to make more machines
											to support the speed and efficiency of my machine.

											Then I got cancer —
											or I found out I had cancer.
											It arrived like a speeding bird
											smashing into a windowpane.
											Suddenly, I had a body,
											a body that was pricked
											and poked and punctured,
											a body that was cut wide open,
											a body that had organs removed
											and transported and rearranged and reconstructed,
											a body that was scanned
											and had tubes shoved down it,
											a body that was burning from chemicals.
											Cancer exploded

											the cancer inside the coal miner&#39;s lungs,

											In his new and visionary book,
											&quot;New Self, New World,&quot;
											the writer Philip Shepherd says,
											&quot;If you are divided from your body,
											you are also divided from the body of the world,
											which then appears to be other than you
											or separate from you,
											rather than the living continuum
											to which you belong.&quot;
											Before cancer,
											the world was something other.
											It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool
											and cancer dynamited the boulder
											that was separating me from the larger sea.
											Now I am swimming in it.
											Now I lay down in the grass
											and I rub my body in it,
											and I love the mud on my legs and feet.
											Now I make a daily pilgrimage
											to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine,
											and I hunger for the green fields
											in the bush outside Bukavu.
											And when it rains hard rain,
											I scream and I run in circles.

											I know that everything is connected,
											and the scar that runs the length of my torso
											is the markings of the earthquake.
											And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince.
											And the fire that burned in me
											on day three through six of chemo
											is the fire that is burning
											in the forests of the world.
											I know that the abscess
											that grew around my wound after the operation,
											the 16 ounces of puss,
											is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico,
											and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me
											and dead floating fish.
											And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication

											In my second chemo,

											And in the name of connectedness,
											the only thing she wanted before she died
											was to be brought home
											by her beloved Gulf of Mexico.

											And gratefully, it didn&#39;t.
											And she died quietly in her favorite place.

											And a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans,
											and this beautiful, spiritual friend
											told me she wanted to do a healing for me.
											And I was honored.
											And I went to her house, and it was morning,
											and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains.
											And my friend was preparing this big bowl,
											and I said, &quot;What is it?&quot;
											And she said, &quot;It&#39;s for you.
											The flowers make it beautiful,
											and the honey makes it sweet.&quot;
											And I said, &quot;But what&#39;s the water part?&quot;
											And in the name of connectedness,
											she said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s the Gulf of Mexico.&quot;
											And I said, &quot;Of course it is.&quot;
											And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle,
											and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water.
											And she sang — I mean her whole body sang.
											And the other women sang
											and they prayed for me and my mother.

											And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head,
											I realized that it held
											the best and the worst of us.
											It was the greed and recklessness
											that led to the drilling explosion.
											It was all the lies that got told
											before and after.
											It was the honey in the water that made it sweet,
											it was the oil that made it sick.
											It was my head that was bald —
											and comfortable now without a hat.
											It was my whole self
											melting into Michaela&#39;s lap.
											It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf
											that were falling down my cheek.
											It was finally being in my body.
											It was the sorrow
											that&#39;s taken so long.
											It was finding my place
											and the huge responsibility
											that comes with connection.
											It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo
											and the indifference of the world.
											It was the Congolese women
											who are now rising up.
											It was my mother leaving,
											just at the moment
											that I was being born.
											It was the realization
											that I had come very close to dying —
											in the same way that the Earth, our mother,
											is barely holding on,
											in the same way that 75 percent of the planet
											are hardly scraping by,
											in the same way

											What I learned
											is it has to do with attention and resources
											that everybody deserves.
											It was advocating friends
											and a doting sister.
											It was wise doctors and advanced medicine
											and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands.
											It was underpaid and really loving nurses.
											It was magic healers and aromatic oils.
											It was people who came with spells and rituals.
											It was having a vision of the future
											and something to fight for,
											because I know this struggle isn&#39;t my own.
											It was a million prayers.
											It was a thousand hallelujahs
											and a million oms.
											It was a lot of anger,
											insane humor,
											a lot of attention, outrage.
											It was energy, love and joy.
											It was all these things.
											It was all these things.
											It was all these things
											in the water, in the world, in my body.

Ensler has also drawn praise for <em><a href=\"http://www.thegoodbody.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Good Body</a>,</em> a play that cuts to women&#39;s obsession with their appearance, and her film <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/pov/whatiwant/\"><em>What I Want My Words to Do to You</em></a>, which portrays a writing group she leads at a correctional facility for women.
