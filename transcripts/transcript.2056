<title>David Sedlak: 4 ways we can avoid a catastrophic drought | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As the world&#39;s climate patterns continue to shift unpredictably, places where drinking water was once abundant may soon find reservoirs dry and groundwater aquifers depleted. In this talk, civil and environmental engineer David Sedlak shares four practical solutions to the ongoing urban water crisis. His goal: to shift our water supply towards new, local sources of water and create a system that is capable of withstanding any of the challenges climate change may throw at us in the coming years." />

<meta content="As the world's climate patterns continue to shift unpredictably, places where drinking water was once abundant may soon find reservoirs dry and groundwater aquifers depleted. In this talk, civil and environmental engineer David Sedlak shares four practical solutions to the ongoing urban water crisis. His goal: to shift our water supply towards new, local sources of water and create a system that is capable of withstanding any of the challenges climate change may throw at us in the coming years." itemprop='description'>

											Our grandparents&#39; generation
created an amazing system
											of canals and reservoirs
that made it possible
											for people to live in places
where there wasn&#39;t a lot of water.
											For example, during the Great Depression,
											they created the Hoover Dam,
											which in turn, created Lake Mead
											and made it possible for the cities
of Las Vegas and Phoenix
											and Los Angeles to provide water
											for people who lived
in a really dry place.

											In the 20th century,
we literally spent trillions of dollars
											building infrastructure
to get water to our cities.
											In terms of economic development,
it was a great investment.
											But in the last decade,
we&#39;ve seen the combined effects
											of climate change, population growth
and competition for water resources
											threaten these vital lifelines
and water resources.

											This figure shows you the change
in the lake level of Lake Mead
											that happened in the last 15 years.
											You can see starting around the year 2000,
											the lake level started to drop.
											And it was dropping at such a rate
											that it would have left the drinking water
intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.
											The city became so concerned about this
											that they recently constructed
a new drinking water intake structure
											that they referred to as the &quot;Third Straw&quot;
											to pull water out
of the greater depths of the lake.

											The challenges associated
with providing water to a modern city
											are not restricted
to the American Southwest.
											In the year 2007, the third largest
city in Australia, Brisbane,
											came within 6 months
of running out of water.
											A similar drama is playing out today
in São Paulo, Brazil,
											where the main reservoir for the city
											has gone from being
completely full in 2010,
											to being nearly empty today
											as the city approaches
the 2016 Summer Olympics.

											For those of us who are fortunate enough
											to live in one
of the world&#39;s great cities,
											we&#39;ve never truly experienced
the effects of a catastrophic drought.
											We like to complain
about the navy showers we have to take.
											We like our neighbors to see
our dirty cars and our brown lawns.
											But we&#39;ve never really faced
the prospect of turning on the tap
											and having nothing come out.
											And that&#39;s because when things
have gotten bad in the past,
											it&#39;s always been possible
to expand a reservoir
											or dig a few more groundwater wells.
											Well, in a time when all
of the water resources are spoken for,
											it&#39;s not going to be possible
to rely on this tried and true way
											of providing ourselves with water.

											Some people think that we&#39;re going
to solve the urban water problem
											by taking water from our rural neighbors.
											But that&#39;s an approach that&#39;s fraught
with political, legal and social dangers.
											And even if we succeed in grabbing
the water from our rural neighbors,
											we&#39;re just transferring
the problem to someone else
											and there&#39;s a good chance
it will come back and bite us
											in the form of higher food prices
											and damage to the aquatic ecosystems
that already rely upon that water.

											I think that there&#39;s a better way
to solve our urban water crisis
											and I think that&#39;s to open up
four new local sources of water
											that I liken to faucets.
											If we can make smart investments
in these new sources of water
											in the coming years,
											we can solve our urban water problem

											Now, if you told me 20 years ago

without a supply of imported water,

as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.

											The first source of local water
supply that we need to develop
											to solve our urban water problem
											will flow with the rainwater
that falls in our cities.
											One of the great tragedies
of urban development
											is that as our cities grew,
											we started covering all the surfaces
with concrete and asphalt.
											And when we did that,
we had to build storm sewers
											to get the water
that fell on the cities out
											before it could cause flooding,
											and that&#39;s a waste
of a vital water resource.
											Let me give you an example.

											Now, I know what some of you
are probably thinking.
											&quot;The answer to our problem
is to start building great big tanks
											and attaching them
to the downspouts of our roof gutters,
											rainwater harvesting.&quot;
											Now, that&#39;s an idea
that might work in some places.
											But if you live in a place
where it mainly rains in the winter time
											and most of the water demand
is in the summertime,
											it&#39;s not a very cost-effective way
to solve a water problem.
											And if you experience the effects
of a multiyear drought,
											like California&#39;s currently experiencing,
											you just can&#39;t build a rainwater tank
that&#39;s big enough to solve your problem.

											I think there&#39;s a lot more practical way
											to harvest the stormwater and
the rainwater that falls in our cities,
											and that&#39;s to capture it
and let it percolate into the ground.
											After all, many of our cities are sitting
on top of a natural water storage system

huge volumes of water.

											For example, historically,
Los Angeles has obtained
											about a third of its water supply
from a massive aquifer
											that underlies the San Fernando Valley.
											Now, when you look at the water
that comes off of your roof
											and runs off of your lawn
and flows down the gutter,
											you might say to yourself,
&quot;Do I really want to drink that stuff?&quot;
											Well, the answer is
you don&#39;t want to drink it
											until it&#39;s been treated a little bit.
											And so the challenge that we face
in urban water harvesting
											is to capture the water, clean the water
											and get it underground.

											And that&#39;s exactly
what the city of Los Angeles is doing
											with a new project that they&#39;re building
in Burbank, California.
											This figure here shows
the stormwater park that they&#39;re building
											by hooking a series of stormwater
collection systems, or storm sewers,
											and routing that water
into an abandoned gravel quarry.
											The water that&#39;s captured in the quarry
											is slowly passed
through a man-made wetland,
											and then it goes
into that ball field there
											and percolates into the ground,
											recharging the drinking water
aquifer of the city.

of passing through the wetland

											The second tap that we need to open up
to solve our urban water problem
											will flow with the wastewater
											that comes out
of our sewage treatment plants.
											Now, many of you are probably familiar
with the concept of recycled water.
											You&#39;ve probably seen signs like this
											that tell you that the shrubbery
and the highway median
											and the local golf course
											is being watered with water
											that used to be
in a sewage treatment plant.
											We&#39;ve been doing this
for a couple of decades now.
											But what we&#39;re learning
from our experience
											is that this approach is much more
expensive that we expected it to be.
											Because once we build
the first few water recycling systems
											close to the sewage treatment plant,
											we have to build longer
and longer pipe networks
											to get that water to where it needs to go.
											And that becomes prohibitive
in terms of cost.

									<p>
											What we&#39;re finding is
											that a much more cost-effective
and practical way of recycling wastewater
											is to turn treated wastewater
into drinking water
											through a two-step process.
											In the first step in this process
we pressurize the water
											and pass it through
a reverse osmosis membrane:
											a thin, permeable plastic membrane
											that allows water molecules
to pass through
											but traps and retains the salts,
the viruses and the organic chemicals
											that might be present in the wastewater.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In the second step in the process,
											we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide
											and shine ultraviolet light on the water.
											The ultraviolet light
cleaves the hydrogen peroxide
											into two parts that are called
hydroxyl radicals,
											and these hydroxyl radicals
are very potent forms of oxygen
											that break down most organic chemicals.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											After the water&#39;s been
through this two-stage process,
											it&#39;s safe to drink.
											I know,
											I&#39;ve been studying recycled water
											using every measurement technique
known to modern science
											for the past 15 years.
											We&#39;ve detected some chemicals
											that can make it through
the first step in the process,
											but by the time we get to the second step,
											the advanced oxidation process,
											we rarely see any chemicals present.
											And that&#39;s in stark contrast
to the taken-for-granted water supplies
											that we regularly drink all the time.

											There&#39;s another way we can recycle water.
											This is an engineered treatment wetland
that we recently built
											on the Santa Ana River
in Southern California.
											The treatment wetland receives water
from a part of the Santa Ana River
											that in the summertime consists
almost entirely of wastewater effluent
											from cities like Riverside
and San Bernardino.
											The water comes
into our treatment wetland,
											it&#39;s exposed to sunlight and algae
											and those break down
the organic chemicals,
											remove the nutrients
and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.
											The water gets put back
in the Santa Ana River,
											it flows down to Anaheim,
											gets taken out at Anaheim
and percolated into the ground,
											and becomes the drinking water
of the city of Anaheim,
											completing the trip
from the sewers of Riverside County
											to the drinking water supply
of Orange County.

											Now, you might think
that this idea of drinking wastewater
											is some sort of futuristic fantasy
or not commonly done.
											Well, in California, we already recycle
about 40 billion gallons a year
											of wastewater through the two-stage
advanced treatment process
											I was telling you about.
											That&#39;s enough water to be
the supply of about a million people

											The third tap that we need to open up

											The fourth and final water tap
that we need to open up

											Now, I know what you probably heard
people say about seawater desalination.
											&quot;It&#39;s a great thing to do if you have
lots of oil, not a lot of water
											and you don&#39;t care about climate change.&quot;
											Seawater desalination is energy-intensive

He is particularly interested in the development of local sources of water, and his research has addressed water reuse&ndash;the practice of using municipal wastewater effluent to sustain aquatic ecosystems and augment drinking water supplies as well as the treatment and use of urban runoff to contaminated groundwater from contaminated industrial sites as water supplies.</p><p class=\"p1\">In recent years, Sedlak&#39;s research on the fate of wastewater-derived contaminants has received considerable attention. He began this research in 1996 when he developed simple methods for measuring steroid hormones in wastewater. Since that time, he and his students have studied the fate of hormones, pharmaceuticals, toxic disinfection byproducts and other chemicals. His research team has also studied approaches for remediating contaminated soil and groundwater by in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) and advanced oxidation processes.</p><p class=\"p1\">He also is the author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/Water40\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Water 4.0</em></a>, a book that examines the ways in which we can gain insight into current water issues by understanding the history of urban water systems.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"David Sedlak","tags":["TEDx","chemistry","climate change","design","engineering","environment","future","global issues","industrial design","innovation","public health","sustainability","urban planning","water","population","infrastructure"],"title":"4 ways we can avoid a catastrophic drought","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1068865}]}
