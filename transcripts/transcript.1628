<title>Siddharthan Chandran: Can the damaged brain repair itself? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: After a traumatic brain injury, it sometimes happens that the brain can repair itself, building new brain cells to replace damaged ones. But the repair doesn&#39;t happen quickly enough to allow recovery from degenerative conditions like motor neuron disease (also known as Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease or ALS). Siddharthan Chandran walks through some new techniques using special stem cells that could allow the damaged brain to rebuild faster." />

<meta content="After a traumatic brain injury, it sometimes happens that the brain can repair itself, building new brain cells to replace damaged ones. But the repair doesn't happen quickly enough to allow recovery from degenerative conditions like motor neuron disease (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS). Siddharthan Chandran walks through some new techniques using special stem cells that could allow the damaged brain to rebuild faster." itemprop='description'>

											I&#39;m very pleased to be here today
											to talk to you all about how we might repair
											the damaged brain,
											and I&#39;m particularly excited by this field,
											because as a neurologist myself,
											I believe that this offers one of the great ways
											that we might be able to offer hope
											for patients who today live with devastating
											and yet untreatable diseases of the brain.

											So here&#39;s the problem.
											You can see here the picture of somebody&#39;s brain
											with Alzheimer&#39;s disease
											next to a healthy brain,
											and what&#39;s obvious is, in the Alzheimer&#39;s brain,
											ringed red, there&#39;s obvious
damage — atrophy, scarring.
											And I could show you equivalent pictures
											from other disease: multiple sclerosis,
											motor neuron disease, Parkinson&#39;s disease,
											even Huntington&#39;s disease,
											and they would all tell a similar story.
											And collectively these brain disorders represent
											one of the major public health threats of our time.
											And the numbers here are really rather staggering.
											At any one time, there are 35 million people today
											living with one of these brain diseases,
											and the annual cost globally
											is 700 billion dollars.
											I mean, just think about that.
											That&#39;s greater than one percent
											of the global GDP.
											And it gets worse,
											because all these numbers are rising
											because these are by and large
											age-related diseases, and we&#39;re living longer.
											So the question we really need to ask ourselves is,
											why, given the devastating impact of these diseases
											to the individual,
											never mind the scale of the societal problem,
											why are there no effective treatments?

											Now in order to consider this,
											I first need to give you a crash course
											in how the brain works.
											So in other words, I need to tell you
											everything I learned at medical school.
											(Laughter)
											But believe me, this isn&#39;t going to take very long.
											Okay? (Laughter)
											So the brain is terribly simple:
											it&#39;s made up of four cells,
											and two of them are shown here.
											There&#39;s the nerve cell,
											and then there&#39;s the myelinating cell,
											or the insulating cell.
											It&#39;s called oligodendrocyte.
											And when these four cells work together
											in health and harmony,
											they create an extraordinary
symphony of electrical activity,
											and it is this electrical activity
											that underpins our ability to think, to emote,
											to remember, to learn, move, feel and so on.
											But equally, each of these individual four cells
											alone or together, can go rogue or die,
											and when that happens, you get damage.
											You get damaged wiring.
											You get disrupted connections.
											And that&#39;s evident here with the slower conduction.
											But ultimately, this damage will manifest
											as disease, clearly.
											And if the starting dying nerve cell
											is a motor nerve, for example,
											you&#39;ll get motor neuron disease.

											So I&#39;d like to give you a real-life illustration
											of what happens with motor neuron disease.
											So this is a patient of mine called John.
											John I saw just last week in the clinic.
											And I&#39;ve asked John to tell us something 
about what were his problems
											that led to the initial diagnosis

									<p>
											Well, you know what? I think there is hope.
											And there&#39;s hope in this next section,
											of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.,
											because what it illustrates
											is, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.
											It just doesn&#39;t do it well enough.
											And so again, there are two
things I want to show you.
											First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.
											And again, it&#39;s another one of these white masses.
											But crucially, the area that&#39;s ringed red
											highlights an area that is pale blue.
											But that area that is pale blue was once white.
											So it was damaged. It&#39;s now repaired.
											Just to be clear: It&#39;s not because of doctors.
											It&#39;s in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.
											This is spontaneous repair.
											It&#39;s amazing and it&#39;s occurred
											because there are stem cells in the brain, even,
											which can enable new myelin, new insulation,
											to be laid down over the damaged nerves.
											And this observation is important for two reasons.
											The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies
											that we learnt at medical school,
											or at least I did, admittedly last century,
											which is that the brain doesn&#39;t repair itself,
											unlike, say, the bone or the liver.
											But actually it does, but it
just doesn&#39;t do it well enough.
											And the second thing it does,
											and it gives us a very clear direction 
of travel for new therapies —
											I mean, you don&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist
											to know what to do here.
											You simply need to find ways of promoting
											the endogenous, spontaneous
repair that occurs anyway.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the question is, why, if we&#39;ve known that
											for some time, as we have,
											why do we not have those treatments?
											And that in part reflects the complexity
											of drug development.
											Now, drug development you might think of
											as a rather expensive but risky bet,
											and the odds of this bet are roughly this:
											they&#39;re 10,000 to one against,
											because you need to screen
about 10,000 compounds
											to find that one potential winner.
											And then you need to spend 15 years
											and spend over a billion dollars,
											and even then, you may not have a winner.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the question for us is,
											can you change the rules of the game
											and can you shorten the odds?
											And in order to do that, you have to think,
											where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?
											And one of the bottlenecks is 
early in drug discovery.
											All that screening occurs in animal models.
											But we know that the proper 
study of mankind is man,
											to borrow from Alexander Pope.
											So the question is, can we study these diseases
											using human material?
											And of course, absolutely we can.
											We can use stem cells,
											and specifically we can use human stem cells.
											And human stem cells are these extraordinary
											but simple cells that can do two things:
											they can self-renew or make more of themselves,
											but they can also become specialized
											to make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells,
											maybe even the motor nerve cell
											or the myelin cell.
											And the challenge has long been,
											can we harness the power,
											the undoubted power of these stem cells
											in order to realize their promise
											for regenerative neurology?

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And I think we can now, and the reason we can
											is because there have been
several major discoveries
											in the last 10, 20 years.
											One of them was here in Edinburgh,
											and it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.
											So Dolly was made in Edinburgh,
											and Dolly was an example
											of the first cloning of a mammal
											from an adult cell.
											But I think the even more significant breakthrough
											for the purposes of our discussion today
											was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist
											called Yamanaka.
											And what Yamaka did,
											in a fantastic form of scientific cookery,
											was he showed that four ingredients,
											just four ingredients,
											could effectively convert any cell, adult cell,
											into a master stem cell.
											And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate,
											because what it means that
from anybody in this room,
											but particularly patients,
											you could now generate
											a bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.
											Take a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell,
											so you could then make those cells
											that are relevant to their disease,
											both to study but potentially to treat.
											Now, the idea of that at medical school —
											this is a recurring theme, isn&#39;t 
it, me and medical school? —
											would have been ridiculous,
											but it&#39;s an absolute reality today.
											And I see this as the cornerstone
											of regeneration, repair and hope.

											And whilst we&#39;re on the theme of hope,
											for those of you who might have failed at school,
											there&#39;s hope for you as well,
											because this is the school report of John Gerdon.
											[&quot;I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist;
on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.&quot;]
											So they didn&#39;t think much of him then.
											But what you may not know is that he

									<p>
											So to return to the original problem,
											what is the opportunity of these stem cells,
											or this disruptive technology,
											for repairing the damaged brain,
											which we call regenerative neurology?
											I think there are two ways you can think about this:
											as a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool,
											and/or as a form of therapy.
											So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those
											in the next few moments.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Drug discovery in a dish is how people often
											talk about this.
											It&#39;s very simple: You take a patient with a disease,
											let&#39;s say motor neuron disease,
											you take a skin sample,
											you do the pluripotent reprogramming,
											as I&#39;ve already told you,
											and you generate live motor nerve cells.
											That&#39;s straightforward, because that&#39;s what
											pluripotent cells can do.
											But crucially, you can then compare their behavior
											to their equivalent but healthy counterparts,
											ideally from an unaffected relative.
											That way, you&#39;re matching for genetic variation.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And that&#39;s exactly what we did here.
											This was a collaboration with colleagues:
											in London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S., 
Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.
											And what you&#39;re looking at, and this is amazing,
											these are living, growing, motor nerve cells
											from a patient with motor neuron disease.
											It happens to be an inherited form.
											I mean, just imagine that.
											This would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.
											So apart from seeing them
grow and put out processes,
											we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce,
											but crucially, we can then
track their individual health
											and compare the diseased motor nerve cells
											to the healthy ones.
											And when you do all that and put it together,
											you realize that the diseased ones,
											which is represented in the red line,
											are two and a half times more likely to die
											than the healthy counterpart.
											And the crucial point about this is that you then have
											a fantastic assay to discover drugs,
											because what would you ask of the drugs,
											and you could do this through a high-throughput
											automated screening system,
											you&#39;d ask the drugs, give me one thing:
											find me a drug that will bring the red line
											closer to the blue line,
											because that drug will be a high-value candidate
											that you could probably take direct to human trial
											and almost bypass that bottleneck
											that I&#39;ve told you about in drug discovery
											with the animal models,
											if that makes sense. It&#39;s fantastic.

									<p>
											But I want to come back
											to how you might use stem cells directly
											to repair damage.
											And again there are two ways to think about this,
											and they&#39;re not mutually exclusive.
											The first, and I think in the long run
											the one that will give us the biggest dividend,
											but it&#39;s not thought of that way just yet,
											is to think about those stem cells that are already
											in your brain, and I&#39;ve told you that.
											All of us have stem cells in the brain,
											even the diseased brain,
											and surely the smart way forward
											is to find ways that you can promote and activate
											those stem cells in your brain already
											to react and respond appropriately to damage
											to repair it.
											That will be the future.
											There will be drugs that will do that.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells,
											transplant them in,
											to replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.
											And I want to tell you now an experiment,
											it&#39;s a clinical trial that we did,
											which recently completed,
											which is with colleagues in UCL,
											David Miller in particular.
											So this study was very simple.
											We took patients with multiple sclerosis
											and asked a simple question:
											Would stem cells from the bone marrow
											be protective of their nerves?
											So what we did was we took this bone marrow,
											grew up the stem cells in the lab,
											and then injected them back into the vein.
											I&#39;m making this sound really simple.
											It took five years off a lot of people, okay?
											And it put gray hair on me
											and caused all kinds of issues.
											But conceptually, it&#39;s essentially simple.
											So we&#39;ve given them into the vein, right?
											So in order to measure whether
this was successful or not,
											we measured the optic nerve
											as our outcome measure.
											And that&#39;s a good thing to measure in M.S.,
											because patients with M.S. sadly suffer
											with problems with vision —
											loss of vision, unclear vision.
											And so we measured the size of the optic nerve
											using the scans with David Miller
											three times — 12 months, six months,
											and before the infusion —
											and you can see the gently declining red line.
											And that&#39;s telling you that
the optic nerve is shrinking,
											which makes sense, because their nerves are dying.
											We then gave the stem cell infusion
											and repeated the measurement twice —
											three months and six months —
											and to our surprise, almost,
											the line&#39;s gone up.
											That suggests that the intervention
											has been protective.
											I don&#39;t think myself that what&#39;s happened
											is that those stem cells have made new myelin
											or new nerves.
											What I think they&#39;ve done is they&#39;ve promoted
											the endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells,
											to do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.
											So this is a proof of concept.
											I&#39;m very excited about that.

randomizes the transmission of nerve impulses. At the Centre for clinical brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh, Siddharthan Chandran works in the emerging discipline of regenerative neurology -- exploring how injured or damaged neurons in the brain might actually be repaired.<br />&nbsp;<br />His research strategy uses MS and motor neuron disease (ALS, or Lou Gehrig&#39;s diesease) as primary disease models, combining laboratory and clinical activity to study&nbsp; brain injury, neurodegeneration and repair, using stem cells to model and test. His work, he says, &quot;reflects the complexity of the brain. You can replace a kidney, but not a brain. One must remain careful and humble in the face of current knowledge.&quot; He is also director of the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Siddharthan Chandran","tags":["brain","health","neuroscience","science","synthetic biology","cognitive science","molecular biology","biotech","aging","health care","medicine","medical research","disability","future","innovation"],"title":"Can the damaged brain repair itself?","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1119627}]}
