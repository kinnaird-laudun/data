<title>Justin Baldoni: Why I&#39;m done trying to be &quot;man enough&quot; | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Justin Baldoni wants to start a dialogue with men about redefining masculinity -- to figure out ways to be not just good men but good humans. In a warm, personal talk, he shares his effort to reconcile who he is with who the world tells him a man should be. And he has a challenge for men: &quot;See if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper,&quot; Baldoni says. &quot;Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Are you brave enough to be vulnerable? Are you strong enough to be sensitive? Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life?&quot;" />

<meta content='Why I&#x0027;m done trying to be "man enough"' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Justin Baldoni wants to start a dialogue with men about redefining masculinity — to figure out ways to be not just good men but good humans. In a warm, personal talk, he shares his effort to reconcile who he is with who the world tells him a man should be. And he has a challenge for men: "See if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper," Baldoni says. "Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Are you brave enough to be vulnerable? Are you strong enough to be sensitive? Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life?"' itemprop='description'>

											Now, these roles don&#39;t represent

one of these roles, I was surprised,

I play ooze machismo,
											charisma and power,
											and when I look in the mirror,

											Now, for as long
as I can remember, I&#39;ve been told
											the kind of man
that I should grow up to be.
											As a boy, all I wanted was to be
accepted and liked by the other boys,
											but that acceptance meant I had to acquire
											this almost disgusted view
of the feminine,
											and since we were told that feminine
is the opposite of masculine,
											I either had to reject
embodying any of these qualities
											or face rejection myself.
											This is the script that we&#39;ve been given.
											Right? Girls are weak,
and boys are strong.
											This is what&#39;s being
subconsciously communicated

and girls all over the world,

											But, sorry, Dad,
as a kid I resented him for it,
											because I blamed him for making me soft,
											which wasn&#39;t welcomed
in the small town in Oregon
											that we had moved to.
											Because being soft
meant that I was bullied.
											See, my dad wasn&#39;t
traditionally masculine,
											so he didn&#39;t teach me how to use my hands.
											He didn&#39;t teach me
how to hunt, how to fight,
											you know, man stuff.
											Instead he taught me what he knew:
											that being a man was about sacrifice
											and doing whatever you can
											to take care of
and provide for your family.
											But there was another role
I learned how to play from my dad,
											who, I discovered,
learned it from his dad,
											a state senator
											who later in life
											had to work nights as a janitor
to support his family,
											and he never told a soul.
											That role was to suffer in secret.
											And now three generations later,
											I find myself playing that role, too.
											So why couldn&#39;t my grandfather
just reach out to another man
											and ask for help?
											Why does my dad to this day still think
he&#39;s got to do it all on his own?
											I know a man who would rather die
											than tell another man
that they&#39;re hurting.
											But it&#39;s not because we&#39;re just all,
like, strong silent types.
											It&#39;s not. A lot of us men are really good
at making friends, and talking,
											just not about anything real.

											So some of the ways
that I have been practicing

that force me to be vulnerable.
											So if there&#39;s something
I&#39;m experiencing shame around in my life,
											I practice diving straight into it,
											no matter how scary it is —
											and sometimes, even publicly.

something amazing happened.
											I realized that I wasn&#39;t alone,

and the courage to share my shame,

											Now, I&#39;ve learned over time

a system of accountability.

											Guys,
											this is real.
											And I&#39;m just scratching the surface here,
											because the deeper we go,
the uglier it gets, I guarantee you.
											I don&#39;t have time to get into porn
and violence against women
											or the split of domestic duties
											or the gender pay gap.
											But I believe that as men,
											it&#39;s time we start to see
past our privilege
											and recognize that we are
not just part of the problem.
											Fellas, we are the problem.
											The glass ceiling exists
because we put it there,
											and if we want to be
a part of the solution,
											then words are no longer enough.

											There&#39;s a quote that I love that
I grew up with from the Bahá&#39;í writings.
											It says that &quot;the world of humanity
is possessed of two wings,
											the male and the female.
											So long as these two wings
are not equivalent in strength,
											the bird will not fly.&quot;

											So women,
											on behalf of men all over the world
											who feel similar to me,
											please forgive us
											for all the ways that we have not
relied on your strength.
											And now I would like
to ask you to formally help us,
											because we cannot do this alone.
											We are men. We&#39;re going to mess up.
											We&#39;re going to say the wrong thing.
We&#39;re going to be tone-deaf.
											We&#39;re more than likely, probably,
going to offend you.
											But don&#39;t lose hope.
											We&#39;re only here because of you,
											and like you, as men, we need
to stand up and become your allies
											as you fight against
											pretty much everything.
											We need your help
in celebrating our vulnerability
											and being patient with us
											as we make this very, very long journey
											from our heads to our hearts.
											And finally to parents:
											instead of teaching our children
											to be brave boys or pretty girls,
											can we maybe just teach them
how to be good humans?

									<p>
											So back to my dad.
											Growing up, yeah, like every boy,
I had my fair share of issues,
											but now I realize that it was
even thanks to his sensitivity
											and emotional intelligence
											that I am able to stand here right now
talking to you in the first place.
											The resentment I had for my dad
I now realize had nothing to do with him.
											It had everything to do with me
and my longing to be accepted
											and to play a role
that was never meant for me.
											So while my dad may have not taught me
how to use my hands,
											he did teach me how to use my heart,
											and to me that makes him
more a man than anything.
