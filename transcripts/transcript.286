											But the reason
I put this up here is because
											when I was in Africa last year,
my wife and I were driving around,
											we had this wonderful guide,
											who showed us something
that surprised both of us,
											and it was very revealing
in terms of the fascination
											that comes with the design of animals.
											It turns out that in about the 1880s,
the missionaries came to Africa
											to spread the word of Christianity,
											to teach English to the natives.
											And they brought blackboards and chalk.
											And I&#39;d like you to imagine
that that&#39;s a blackboard,
											and I just used some chalk on there.
											And they brought
quite a bit of this stuff.
											But over the years,
the blackboards were fine,
											but they ran out of chalk.
											And this is a real crisis for them.

									<p>
											And that&#39;s where the hyena comes in.
											The hyena is probably
the most perfectly designed
											scavenging animal in the world.
											It strip-mines carcasses,
and it has amazing teeth,
											because it enables the hyena
to essentially eat bones.
											Now, the end product of that action
is up on the board here.
											What the missionaries would do is,
they&#39;d walk around
											and they&#39;d pick up hyena shit.
											And the incredible thing
about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.

											That&#39;s not what I&#39;m here to talk about,

											We were in the desert,
in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.
											There were four of us,
two Bedouin drivers.
											You can just imagine,
this expanse is an ocean of sand,
											105 degrees, one water bottle.
											And we were driving in what they told us
was their very, very best Jeep.
											Didn&#39;t look like it to me.
											And as we started to go
through the desert,
											the Jeep broke down.
											The guys got out, they put the hood up,
											they started working
under the hood, got it going again.
											About a hundred yards, it broke down.
											This went on about 6-7 times,
we were getting more and more alarmed,
											we were also getting deeper
and deeper into the desert.

									<p>
											And eventually,
our worst nightmare happened:
											they flooded the engine.
											And they said, &quot;Ah, no problem!
We just get out and walk.&quot;
											And we said, &quot;We get out and walk?&quot;
											One water bottle, remember,
guys, four people.
											And they said, &quot;Yeah, yeah, we&#39;ll walk.
We&#39;ll find some camels.&quot;
											We got out and walked, and sure enough,
											about half a mile, we came
over the crest of this hill,
											and there was a huge gathering
of Bedouin with their camels.
											The guy went up and started dickering,
											and 10 dollars later, we had four camels.
											They went down like elevators;
we got on them.
											They went back up, and the Bedouin,
each Bedouin, four of them,
											got behind each of the camels
with a little whip.
											And they started slashing away
at the back of the camels,
											and they started galloping.
											And if you&#39;ve ever been on a camel,
it is a very, very uncomfortable ride.
											There&#39;s also one other aspect
about these camels.
											About every 10 steps, they lean back
											and try to take a chunk out of your leg.

to take a chunk out of my leg.
											And eventually, three miles later,
we arrived at our destination,

I should bring a camel.

animal in the world.&quot;
											He went, &quot;Nah. I don&#39;t think

close and personal with this camel.

look at its teeth.

actually turn them both around.

we use our binocular vision.

											So not only do they have
the very long eyelashes,

											KB: What I didn&#39;t show you was,
you got that swinging thing going?
											Well, and you&#39;re glad

											One of the other things
about the camel&#39;s beautiful design
											is that its penis points backwards.

its tail in the stream,
											and just whacker
the entire area around him.
											And that&#39;s how
he really marks his territory.
											Now, what you also didn&#39;t see was that —

in the pen beside him

											In the pen beside him is Jasmine.
											Jasmine has been his mate for some time.
											But on this particular occasion,
it was very, very clear
											that as horny as Suki was,
Jasmine was having none of it.

is in search of a mate,

the perfect mate?

											It&#39;s so vital to the inhabitants

											Camel seeking camel
											Lusty beast desires

											I&#39;m TED Camel.
											The perfect desert machine.
											I&#39;m smartly designed.
											Eyelashes that keep out sand
											and a third eyelash that works
like a windshield wiper.
											A distinguished nose —
											with nostrils lined
to filter out sand and dust
											and a groove that catches moisture.
											Amazingly full lips —
											that allow me to eat practically
anything that grows.
											Callouses on my knees
that let me kneel comfortably.
											Leathery chest pads that beat the heat.
											Short fur that keeps my skin cool.
											Long legs that allow heat to escape.
											And my hump?
											Ogden Nash once wrote:
											&quot;The camel has a single hump;
the dromedary two,
											or else the other way around.
I&#39;m never sure. Are you?&quot;
											Here&#39;s a hint:
											Bactarian.
											Dromedary.
											My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat,
but doesn&#39;t store H2O.
											I&#39;m built to last.
											I&#39;m the go-to animal
when the oasis is dry.
											I usually won&#39;t sweat
until my body reaches 105 ºF,
											enough to fry an egg.
											I&#39;m able to lose 40%
of my weight without dying.
											(Most animals would
if they lost half that much.)
											I&#39;ll drink 5 to 7 gallons
of water a day.
											But go without for more than a month.
											I&#39;m powerful.
											Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.
											Outrun a horse —
											And cover 26 miles on a good day.
											Camelot.
											Jackie O. once said
that traveling by camel
											made riding an elephant seem
like taking a jet plane.
											Yet my large, soft feet
allow me to navigate sand.
											(Is that why the Bedouin
claim I can dance?)
											I&#39;m a good provider, too.
											Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God.
											No surprise.
											Tents and rugs are made of my hair.
											My dried bones are prized
as a sort of ivory.
											My dung is burned as fuel.
My milk is used for cheese.
											&quot;Camels are like angels,&quot;
a Bedouin once said.

											Thank you. I just want to leave you
with one last thought,
											which is probably the most important
thing to take away.
											Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky
creatures because, by and large,

											we adapt our environment to us.

through this conference,

											ultimately adapts,

that adapts to it;
											it has to adapt to the environment.

rather not dwell upon.","whylisten":"<p>As the former editor of <em>National Geographic Traveler</em>, Keith Bellows stepped away from the human aspects of travel for a moment to present one of his other fascinations: <strong>animal design. And not just the beautiful, photogenic aspects of that design either.</strong> After a harrowing breakdown in the Sahara with one water bottle to share among four people, Bellows was forced to make a rendezvous via camel ride, and became certain that this animal was, in addition to being a &quot;mean son-of-a-bitch,&quot; the most perfectly designed creature on Earth.<br /><br />Convinced by the organizers that <strong>bringing a live camel to the TED Conference was not a wise idea</strong>, Bellows did the next best thing, and drafted a National Geographic film crew to go to the Washington Zoo. They returned with a film of Suki, a 2,000-pound creature in the midst of rut, with shocking capabilities lurking in his spinning tail and rear-facing genitalia, all gleefully outlined in the film. But though this creature may seem unsavory, he&#39;s perfectly adapted to survival in the harshest environments around, and critical to the survival of the nomads that call the desert home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Keith Bellows","tags":["animals","energy","entertainment","global issues","sex","transportation"],"title":"The camel's hump","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":193204}]}
