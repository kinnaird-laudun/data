											Okay, in this presentation,
											I&#39;m going to be putting the right side of your brains
											through a fairly serious workout.
											You&#39;re going to see a lot of imagery,
											and it&#39;s not always connected to what I&#39;m talking about,
											so I need you to kind of split your brains in half
											and let the images flow over one side
											and listen to me on the other.
											So I am one of those people
											with a transformative personal story.
											Six years ago,
											after 20 years in graphic design and typography,
											I changed the way I was working
											and the way most graphic designers work
											to pursue a more personal approach to my work,
											with only the humble attempt
											to simply make a living doing something that I loved.
											But something weird happened.
											I became bizarrely
											popular.
											My current work
											seems to resonate with people
											in a way that has so taken me by surprise
											that I still frequently wonder
											what in the hell is going on.
											And I&#39;m slowly coming to understand
											that the appeal of what I do
											may be connected to why I do it.

											These days, I call myself a graphic artist.
											So where my work as a graphic designer
											was to follow strategy,
											my work now
											follows my heart
											and my interests
											with the guidance of my ego
											to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.
											Now, this is heresy
											in the design world.
											The ego is not supposed
											to be involved in graphic design.
											But I find that for myself,
											without exception,
											the more I deal with the work
											as something of my own,
											as something that is personal,
											the more successful it is
											as something that&#39;s compelling,
											interesting and sustaining.
											So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream
											of design thinking.
											Where others might look at measurable results,
											I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities,
											like &quot;Does it bring joy?&quot;
											&quot;Is there a sense of wonder?&quot;
											and &quot;Does it invoke curiosity?&quot;

											This is a scientific diagram, by the way.
											I don&#39;t have time to explain it,
											but it has to do with DNA and RNA.
											So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.
											The things that interest me when I&#39;m working
											are visual structure,
											surprise
											and anything that requires figuring things out.
											So for this reason, I&#39;m particularly drawn
											to systems and patterns.
											I&#39;m going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.

											This is a piece that I did for
											The Guardian newspaper in the U.K.
											They have a magazine that they call G2.
											And this is for their puzzle special
											in 2007.
											And puzzling it is.
											I started by creating a series of tiling units.
											And these tiling units, I designed
											specifically so that they would contain
											parts of letterforms within their shapes
											so that I could then
											join those pieces together
											to create letters and then words
											within the abstract patterning.
											But then as well, I was able to
											just flip them, rotate them
											and combine them in different ways
											to create either regular patterns
											or abstract patterns.
											So here&#39;s the word puzzle again.
											And here it is with the abstract surrounding.
											And as you can see, it&#39;s extremely difficult to read.
											But all I have to do is
											fill certain areas of those letterforms
											and I can bring those words out of
											the background pattern.
											But maybe that&#39;s a little too obvious.
											So then I can add some color in with the background
											and add a bit more color in with the words themselves,
											and this way, working with the art director,
											I&#39;m able to bring it to just the right point
											that it&#39;s puzzling for the audience —
											they can figure out that there&#39;s something they have to read —
											but it&#39;s not impossible for them to read.

											I&#39;m also interested in working with
											unusual materials
											and common materials in unusual ways.
											So this requires figuring out how to
											get the most out of something&#39;s innate properties
											and also how to bend it to my will.
											So ultimately,
											my goal is to create something unexpected.
											To this end, I have worked in sugar
											for Stefan Sagmeister,
											three-time TED speaker.
											And this project began essentially
											on my kitchen table.
											I&#39;ve been eating cereal for breakfast
											all of my life.
											And for that same amount of time,
											I&#39;ve been spilling sugar on the table
											and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.
											And eventually I used this technique
											to create a piece of artwork.
											And then I used it again to create
											six pieces for Stefan&#39;s book,
											&quot;Things in My Life I&#39;ve Learned So Far.&quot;
											And these were created
											without sketches, just freehand,
											by putting the sugar down on a white surface
											and then manipulating it to get

											Recently, I&#39;ve also made some

											And this is for a chapter that I&#39;m doing in a book,

											So it&#39;s a little bit unexpected,

											to the macaroni art
											that children make for their parents
											or they make in school and give to their parents,
											which is in itself a form of honor.
											This is what you can do with some household tinfoil.

											I&#39;m very interested in wonder,
											in design as an impetus to inquiring.
											To say I wonder is to say
											I question, I ask.
											And to experience wonder is to experience awe.
											So I&#39;m currently working on a book,
											which plays with both senses of the word,
											as I explore some of my own ideas
											and inquiries
											in a visual display of rather
											peacock-like grandeur.
											The world is full of wonder.
											But the world of graphic design,
											for the most part, is not.
											So I&#39;m using my own writings
											as a kind of testing ground for a book that has
											an interdependency between word and image
											as a kind of seductive force.
											I think that one of the things
											that religions got right
											was the use of visual wonder
											to deliver a message.
											I think this true marriage of art and information
											is woefully underused in adult literature,
											and I&#39;m mystified as to
											why visual wealth is not more commonly used
											to enhance intellectual wealth.
											When we look at works like this,
											we tend to associate them with children&#39;s literature.
											There&#39;s an implication that ornamental graphics
											detract from the seriousness of the content.
											But I really hope to have the opportunity
											to change that perception.
											This book is taking rather a long time,
											but I&#39;m nearly done.

											So I do these valentines.
											I&#39;ve been sending out valentines
											on a fairly large scale since 2005.
											These are my valentines
											from 2005 and 2006.
											And I started by
											doing just a single image like this
											and sending them out to each person.
											But in 2007,
											I got the cockamamie idea
											to hand-draw each valentine
											for everyone on my mailing list.
											I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.
											And I drew each person
											their own unique valentine
											and put their name on it
											and numbered it and signed it and sent it out.
											Believe it or not, I devised this
											as a timesaving method.
											I was very busy in the beginning of that year,
											and I didn&#39;t know when I was going to find time
											to design and print a single valentine.
											And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal
											as I was traveling.
											It didn&#39;t exactly work out that way.
											There&#39;s a longer story to this,
											but I did get them all done in time,
											and they were extremely well received.
											I got an almost 100 percent response rate.
											(Laughter)
											And those who didn&#39;t respond
											will never receive anything from me ever again.

											Last year,
											I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.
											I had this idea that I wanted people
											to receive a kind of
											mysterious love letter,
											like a found fragment in their mailbox.
											I wanted it to be something
											that was not addressed to them
											or signed by me,
											something that caused them to wonder
											what on Earth this thing was.
											And I specifically wrote
											four pages that don&#39;t connect.
											There were four different versions of this.
											And I wrote them
											so that they begin in the middle of a sentence,
											end in the middle of a sentence.
											And they&#39;re on the one hand, universal,
											so I avoid specific names or places,
											but on the other hand, they&#39;re personal.
											So I wanted people to really get the sense that
											they had received something that could have been
											a love letter to them.
											And I&#39;m just going to read one of them to you.

											&quot;You&#39;ve never really been sure of this,

											So Valentine&#39;s Day
											is coming up in a couple of days,
											and these are currently arriving
											in mailboxes all around the world.
											This year, I got, what I really have to say
											is a rather brilliant idea,
											to laser cut
											my valentines
											out of used Christmas cards.
											So I solicited friends
											to send me their used Christmas cards,
											and I made 500 of these.

											I do spend a lot of time on my work.
											And one of the things that I&#39;ve been thinking about recently
											is what is worth while.
											What is it that&#39;s worth spending my time on
											and my life on in this way?
											Working in the commercial world,
											this is something that I do have to struggle with at times.
											And yes, sometimes I&#39;m swayed by money.
											But ultimately, I don&#39;t consider that a worthy goal.
											What makes something worthwhile for me
											is the people I work for or with,
											the conditions I work under
											and the audience that I&#39;m able to reach.
											So I might ask: &quot;Who is it for?&quot;
											&quot;What does it say?&quot;
											and &quot;What does it do?&quot;

											You know, I have to tell you, it&#39;s really difficult
											for someone like me to come up on stage
											at this conference
											with these unbelievably brilliant minds,
											who are thinking these
											really big-picture,
											world-changing, life-changing
											ideas and technologies.
											And it&#39;s very, very common
											for designers and people in the visual arts
											to feel that we&#39;re
											not contributing enough,
											or worse, that all we&#39;re doing is
											contributing to landfill.
											Here I am; I&#39;m showing you
											some pretty visuals
											and talking about aesthetics.
											But I&#39;ve come to believe that
											truly imaginative visual work
											is extremely important in society.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Just in the way that I&#39;m inspired
											by books
											and magazines of all kinds,
											conversations I have, movies,
											so I also think,
											when I put visual work out there into the mass media,
											work that is interesting, unusual,
											intriguing,
											work that maybe opens up that sense
											of inquiry in the mind,
											that I&#39;m seeding the imagination of the populace.
											And you just never know who
											is going to take something from that
											and turn it into something else,
											because inspiration
											is cross-pollinating.
											So a piece of mine
											may inspire a playwright
											or a novelist or a scientist,
											and that in turn may be the seed
											that inspires a doctor
											or a philanthropist
											or a babysitter.
											And this isn&#39;t something that you can quantify
											or track or measure,
											and we tend to undervalue things in society
											that we can&#39;t measure.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But I really believe
											that a fully operating, rich society
											needs these seeds coming from all directions
											and all disciplines
											in order to keep the gears of inspiration
											and imagination
											flowing and cycling and growing.
											So that&#39;s why I do what I do,
											and why I spend so much time and effort on it,
											and why I work in the commercial, public sphere,
											as opposed to the isolated, private sphere
											of fine art:
											because I want as many people as possible
											to see my work, notice it, be drawn into it,
											and be able to take something from it.
											And I actually really feel that it&#39;s worthwhile
											to spend my valuable
											and limited time on this Earth
											in this way.
											And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you.
