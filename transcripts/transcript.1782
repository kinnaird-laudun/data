											There is an entire genre of YouTube videos
											devoted to an experience which
											I am certain that everyone in this room has had.
											It entails an individual who,
											thinking they&#39;re alone,
											engages in some expressive behavior —
											wild singing, gyrating dancing,
											some mild sexual activity —
											only to discover that, in fact, they are not alone,
											that there is a person watching and lurking,
											the discovery of which causes them
											to immediately cease what they were doing
											in horror.
											The sense of shame and humiliation
											in their face is palpable.
											It&#39;s the sense of,
											&quot;This is something I&#39;m willing to do
											only if no one else is watching.&quot;

											This is the crux of the work
											on which I have been singularly focused
											for the last 16 months,
											the question of why privacy matters,
											a question that has arisen
											in the context of a global debate,
											enabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden
											that the United States and its partners,
											unbeknownst to the entire world,
											has converted the Internet,
											once heralded as an unprecedented tool
											of liberation and democratization,
											into an unprecedented zone
											of mass, indiscriminate surveillance.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											There is a very common sentiment
											that arises in this debate,
											even among people who are uncomfortable
											with mass surveillance, which says
											that there is no real harm
											that comes from this large-scale invasion
											because only people who are engaged in bad acts
											have a reason to want to hide
											and to care about their privacy.
											This worldview is implicitly grounded
											in the proposition that there are
two kinds of people in the world,
											good people and bad people.
											Bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks
											or who engage in violent criminality
											and therefore have reasons to
want to hide what they&#39;re doing,
											have reasons to care about their privacy.
											But by contrast, good people
											are people who go to work,
											come home, raise their children, watch television.
											They use the Internet not to plot bombing attacks
											but to read the news or exchange recipes
											or to plan their kids&#39; Little League games,
											and those people are doing nothing wrong
											and therefore have nothing to hide
											and no reason to fear
											the government monitoring them.

											The people who are actually saying that
											are engaged in a very extreme act
											of self-deprecation.
											What they&#39;re really saying is,
											&quot;I have agreed to make myself
											such a harmless and unthreatening
											and uninteresting person that I actually don&#39;t fear
											having the government know what it is that I&#39;m doing.&quot;
											This mindset has found what I think
											is its purest expression
											in a 2009 interview with
											the longtime CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who,
											when asked about all the different ways his company
											is causing invasions of privacy
											for hundreds of millions of people around the world,
											said this: He said,
											&quot;If you&#39;re doing something that you don&#39;t want
											other people to know,
											maybe you shouldn&#39;t be doing it in the first place.&quot;

									<p>
											Now, there&#39;s all kinds of things to say about
											that mentality,
											the first of which is that the people who say that,
											who say that privacy isn&#39;t really important,
											they don&#39;t actually believe it,
											and the way you know that
they don&#39;t actually believe it
											is that while they say with their
words that privacy doesn&#39;t matter,
											with their actions, they take all kinds of steps
											to safeguard their privacy.
											They put passwords on their email
											and their social media accounts,
											they put locks on their bedroom
											and bathroom doors,
											all steps designed to prevent other people
											from entering what they consider their private realm
											and knowing what it is that they
don&#39;t want other people to know.
											The very same Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google,
											ordered his employees at Google
											to cease speaking with the online
											Internet magazine CNET
											after CNET published an article
											full of personal, private information
											about Eric Schmidt,
											which it obtained exclusively
through Google searches

											This same division can be seen
											with the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,
											who in an infamous interview in 2010
											pronounced that privacy is no longer
											a &quot;social norm.&quot;
											Last year, Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife
											purchased not only their own house
											but also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto
											for a total of 30 million dollars
											in order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy
											that prevented other people from monitoring
											what they do in their personal lives.

											Over the last 16 months, as I&#39;ve
debated this issue around the world,
											every single time somebody has said to me,
											&quot;I don&#39;t really worry about invasions of privacy
											because I don&#39;t have anything to hide.&quot;

											I get out a pen, I write down my email address.

											What I want you to do when you get home
											is email me the passwords
											to all of your email accounts,
											not just the nice, respectable work one in your name,
											but all of them,
											because I want to be able to just troll through
											what it is you&#39;re doing online,
											read what I want to read and
publish whatever I find interesting.
											After all, if you&#39;re not a bad person,
											if you&#39;re doing nothing wrong,

											Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.
											I check and — (Applause)
											I check that email account religiously all the time.
											It&#39;s a very desolate place.
											And there&#39;s a reason for that,
											which is that we as human beings,
											even those of us who in words
											disclaim the importance of our own privacy,
											instinctively understand
											the profound importance of it.
											It is true that as human beings, we&#39;re social animals,
											which means we have a need for other people
											to know what we&#39;re doing and saying and thinking,
											which is why we voluntarily publish
information about ourselves online.
											But equally essential to what it means
											to be a free and fulfilled human being
											is to have a place that we can go
											and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people.
											There&#39;s a reason why we seek that out,
											and our reason is that all of us —
											not just terrorists and criminals, all of us —
											have things to hide.
											There are all sorts of things that we do and think
											that we&#39;re willing to tell our physician
											or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse
											or our best friend that we would be mortified
											for the rest of the world to learn.
											We make judgments every single day
											about the kinds of things that we say and think and do
											that we&#39;re willing to have other people know,
											and the kinds of things that we say and think and do
											that we don&#39;t want anyone else to know about.
											People can very easily in words claim
											that they don&#39;t value their privacy,
											but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.

											Now, there&#39;s a reason why privacy is so craved
											universally and instinctively.
											It isn&#39;t just a reflexive movement
											like breathing air or drinking water.
											The reason is that when we&#39;re in a state
											where we can be monitored,
where we can be watched,
											our behavior changes dramatically.
											The range of behavioral options that we consider
											when we think we&#39;re being watched
											severely reduce.
											This is just a fact of human nature
											that has been recognized in social science
											and in literature and in religion
											and in virtually every field of discipline.
											There are dozens of psychological studies
											that prove that when somebody knows
											that they might be watched,
											the behavior they engage in
											is vastly more conformist and compliant.
											Human shame is a very powerful motivator,
											as is the desire to avoid it,
											and that&#39;s the reason why people,
											when they&#39;re in a state of
being watched, make decisions
											not that are the byproduct of their own agency
											but that are about the expectations
											that others have of them
											or the mandates of societal orthodoxy.

											This realization was exploited most powerfully
											for pragmatic ends by the 18th-
century philosopher Jeremy Bentham,
											who set out to resolve an important problem
											ushered in by the industrial age,
											where, for the first time, institutions had become
											so large and centralized
											that they were no longer able to monitor
											and therefore control each one
of their individual members,
											and the solution that he devised
											was an architectural design
											originally intended to be implemented in prisons
											that he called the panopticon,
											the primary attribute of which was the construction
											of an enormous tower in the center of the institution
											where whoever controlled the institution
											could at any moment watch any of the inmates,
											although they couldn&#39;t watch all of them at all times.
											And crucial to this design
											was that the inmates could not actually
											see into the panopticon, into the tower,
											and so they never knew
											if they were being watched or even when.
											And what made him so excited about this discovery
											was that that would mean that the prisoners
											would have to assume that they were being watched
											at any given moment,
											which would be the ultimate enforcer
											for obedience and compliance.
											The 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault
											realized that that model could be used
											not just for prisons but for every institution
											that seeks to control human behavior:
											schools, hospitals, factories, workplaces.
											And what he said was that this mindset,
											this framework discovered by Bentham,
											was the key means of societal control
											for modern, Western societies,
											which no longer need
											the overt weapons of tyranny —
											punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents,
											or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party —
											because mass surveillance creates
											a prison in the mind
											that is a much more subtle
											though much more effective means
											of fostering compliance with social norms
											or with social orthodoxy,
											much more effective
											than brute force could ever be.

											The most iconic work of literature about surveillance
											and privacy is the George Orwell novel &quot;1984,&quot;
											which we all learn in school, and
therefore it&#39;s almost become a cliche.
											In fact, whenever you bring it up
in a debate about surveillance,
											people instantaneously dismiss it
											as inapplicable, and what they say is,
											&quot;Oh, well in &#39;1984,&#39; there were
monitors in people&#39;s homes,
											they were being watched at every given moment,
											and that has nothing to do with
the surveillance state that we face.&quot;
											That is an actual fundamental misapprehension
											of the warnings that Orwell issued in &quot;1984.&quot;
											The warning that he was issuing
											was about a surveillance state
											not that monitored everybody at all times,
											but where people were aware that they could
											be monitored at any given moment.
											Here is how Orwell&#39;s narrator, Winston Smith,
											described the surveillance system
											that they faced:
											&quot;There was, of course, no way of knowing
											whether you were being watched
at any given moment.&quot;
											He went on to say,
											&quot;At any rate, they could plug in your wire
											whenever they wanted to.
											You had to live, did live,
											from habit that became instinct,
											in the assumption that every sound you made
											was overheard and except in darkness
											every movement scrutinized.&quot;

											The Abrahamic religions similarly posit
											that there&#39;s an invisible, all-knowing authority
											who, because of its omniscience,
											always watches whatever you&#39;re doing,
											which means you never have a private moment,
											the ultimate enforcer
											for obedience to its dictates.

											What all of these seemingly disparate works
											recognize, the conclusion that they all reach,
											is that a society in which people
											can be monitored at all times
											is a society that breeds conformity
											and obedience and submission,
											which is why every tyrant,
											the most overt to the most subtle,
											craves that system.
											Conversely, even more importantly,
											it is a realm of privacy,
											the ability to go somewhere where we can think
											and reason and interact and speak
											without the judgmental eyes
of others being cast upon us,
											in which creativity and exploration
											and dissent exclusively reside,
											and that is the reason why,
											when we allow a society to exist
											in which we&#39;re subject to constant monitoring,
											we allow the essence of human freedom
											to be severely crippled.

											The last point I want to observe about this mindset,
											the idea that only people who 
are doing something wrong
											have things to hide and therefore
reasons to care about privacy,
											is that it entrenches two very destructive messages,
											two destructive lessons,
											the first of which is that
											the only people who care about privacy,
											the only people who will seek out privacy,
											are by definition bad people.
											This is a conclusion that we should have
											all kinds of reasons for avoiding,
											the most important of which is that when you say,
											&quot;somebody who is doing bad things,&quot;
											you probably mean things
like plotting a terrorist attack
											or engaging in violent criminality,
											a much narrower conception
											of what people who wield power mean
											when they say, &quot;doing bad things.&quot;
											For them, &quot;doing bad things&quot; typically means
											doing something that poses meaningful challenges
											to the exercise of our own power.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The other really destructive
											and, I think, even more insidious lesson
											that comes from accepting this mindset
											is there&#39;s an implicit bargain
											that people who accept this mindset have accepted,
											and that bargain is this:
											If you&#39;re willing to render yourself
											sufficiently harmless,
											sufficiently unthreatening
											to those who wield political power,
											then and only then can you be free
											of the dangers of surveillance.
											It&#39;s only those who are dissidents,
											who challenge power,
											who have something to worry about.
											There are all kinds of reasons why we
should want to avoid that lesson as well.
											You may be a person who, right now,
											doesn&#39;t want to engage in that behavior,
											but at some point in the future you might.
											Even if you&#39;re somebody who decides
											that you never want to,
											the fact that there are other people
											who are willing to and able to resist
											and be adversarial to those in power —
											dissidents and journalists
											and activists and a whole range of others —
											is something that brings us all collective good
											that we should want to preserve.
											Equally critical is that the measure
											of how free a society is
											is not how it treats its good,
											obedient, compliant citizens,
											but how it treats its dissidents
											and those who resist orthodoxy.
											But the most important reason
											is that a system of mass surveillance
											suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.
											It renders off-limits
											all kinds of behavioral choices
											without our even knowing that it&#39;s happened.
											The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg
											once said, &quot;He who does not move
											does not notice his chains.&quot;
											We can try and render the chains
											of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable,
											but the constraints that it imposes on us
											do not become any less potent.
