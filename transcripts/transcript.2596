<title>Vivek Maru: How to put the power of law in people&#39;s hands | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What can you do when the wheels of justice don&#39;t turn fast enough? Or when they don&#39;t turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. &quot;A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way,&quot; Maru says." />

<meta content='What can you do when the wheels of justice don&#x0027;t turn fast enough? Or when they don&#x0027;t turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. "A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way," Maru says.' itemprop='description'>

											Ravi&#39;s from a community
of herdspeople in Gujarat
											on the western coast of India,
											same place my own family comes from.
											When he was 10 years old,
his entire community was forced to move
											because a multinational corporation
											constructed a manufacturing facility
on the land where they lived.
											Then, 20 years later,
the same company built a cement factory
											100 meters from where they live now.
											India has got strong
environmental regulations on paper,
											but this company
has violated many of them.
											Dust from that factory
covers Ravi&#39;s mustache
											and everything he wears.
											I spent just two days in his place,
and I coughed for a week.
											Ravi says that if people or animals
eat anything that grows in his village
											or drink the water,
											they get sick.
											He says children now walk
long distances with cattle and buffalo
											to find uncontaminated grazing land.
											He says many of those kids
have dropped out of school,
											including three of his own.

											He said the company ignored
every one of those letters,
											and so in 2013,
											Ravi Nanda decided to use
the last means of protest
											he thought he had left.
											He walked to the gates of that factory
with a bucket of petrol in his hands,

											Ravi is not alone in his desperation.
											The UN estimates that worldwide,
											four billion people live
without basic access to justice.
											These people face grave threats
to their safety, their livelihoods,
											their dignity.
											There are almost always laws on the books
that would protect these people,
											but they&#39;ve often
never heard of those laws,
											and the systems that are supposed
to enforce those laws

											We are living with a global
epidemic of injustice,
											but we&#39;ve been choosing to ignore it.
											Right now, in Sierra Leone,
											in Cambodia, in Ethiopia,
											farmers are being cajoled
											into putting their thumbprints
on 50-year lease agreements,
											signing away all the land
they&#39;ve ever known for a pittance
											without anybody even explaining the terms.
											Governments seem to think that&#39;s OK.
											Right now, in the United States,
											in India, in Slovenia,
											people like Ravi
are raising their children
											in the shadow of factories or mines
											that are poisoning
their air and their water.
											There are environmental laws
that would protect these people,
											but many have never seen those laws,
											let alone having a shot at enforcing them.

to have decided that&#39;s OK.

											But grandma&#39;s right, in a way.
											Something about law
and lawyers has gone wrong.
											We lawyers are usually
expensive, first of all,
											and we tend to focus
on formal court channels
											that are impractical
for many of the problems people face.
											Worse, our profession has shrouded law
in a cloak of complexity.
											Law is like riot gear on a police officer.
											It&#39;s intimidating and impenetrable,
											and it&#39;s hard to tell
there&#39;s something human underneath.

											If we&#39;re going to make justice
a reality for everyone,
											we need to turn law
from an abstraction or a threat
											into something that every single person
can understand, use and shape.
											Lawyers are crucial
in that fight, no doubt,
											but we can&#39;t leave it to lawyers alone.
											In health care, for example,
											we don&#39;t just rely
on doctors to serve patients.
											We have nurses and midwives
and community health workers.
											The same should be true of justice.
											Community legal workers,
											sometimes we call them
community paralegals,
											or barefoot lawyers,
											can be a bridge.
											These paralegals are from
the communities they serve.
											They demystify law,
											break it down into simple terms,
											and then they help people
look for a solution.
											They don&#39;t focus on the courts alone.
											They look everywhere:
											ministry departments,
local government, an ombudsman&#39;s office.
											Lawyers sometimes say to their clients,
											&quot;I&#39;ll handle it for you. I&#39;ve got you.&quot;
											Paralegals have a different message,
											not &quot;I&#39;m going to solve it for you,&quot;
											but &quot;We&#39;re going to solve it together,
											and in the process,
we&#39;re both going to grow.&quot;

											Community paralegals

											Then, two years later, he met someone.
											I&#39;m going to call him Kush.
											Kush is part of a team
of community paralegals
											that works for environmental justice
on the Gujarat coast.
											Kush explained to Ravi
that there was law on his side.
											Kush translated into Gujarati
something Ravi had never seen.
											It&#39;s called the &quot;consent to operate.&quot;
											It&#39;s issued by the state government,
											and it allows the factory to run
											only if it complies
with specific conditions.
											So together, they compared
the legal requirements with reality,
											they collected evidence,
											and they drafted an application —
											not to the courts,
but to two administrative institutions,
											the Pollution Control Board
and the district administration.
											Those applications started turning
the creaky wheels of enforcement.
											A pollution officer
came for a site inspection,
											and after that, the company
started running an air filtration system
											it was supposed to have
been using all along.
											It also started covering the 100 trucks
											that come and go
from that plant every day.
											Those two measures
reduced the air pollution considerably.
											The case is far from over,
											but learning and using law gave Ravi hope.

											Let me give you another example.
											This is Khadija Hamsa.
											She is one of five million people in Kenya
who faces a discriminatory vetting process
											when trying to obtain a national ID card.
											It is like the Jim Crow South
in the United States.
											If you are from a certain set of tribes,
											most of them Muslim,
											you get sent to a different line.
											Without an ID, you can&#39;t apply for a job.
											You can&#39;t get a bank loan.
											You can&#39;t enroll in university.
											You are excluded from society.
											Khadija tried off and on to get an ID
for eight years, without success.
											Then she met a paralegal
working in her community
											named Hassan Kassim.
											Hassan explained to Khadija
how vetting works,
											he helped her gather
the documents she needed,
											helped prep her to go before
the vetting committee.
											Finally, she was able to get an ID
with Hassan&#39;s help.
											First thing she did with it
											was use it to apply
for birth certificates for her children,
											which they need in order to go to school.

											In the United States,
among many other problems,

											In many cities,
											90 percent of the landlords
in housing court have attorneys,
											while 90 percent of the tenants do not.
											In New York, a new crew of paralegals —
											they&#39;re called
Access to Justice Navigators —
											helps people to understand housing law
and to advocate for themselves.
											Normally in New York,
											one out of nine tenants
brought to housing court
											gets evicted.
											Researchers took a look at 150 cases

											I see the beginnings of a real movement,

											Not yet.
											In most countries around the world,

a single dollar of support
											to paralegals like Hassan and Kush.

the role paralegals play,

											Hope and despair are neck and neck.
											And so not only do we urgently need
to support and protect

around the world,

											Every case a paralegal takes on
											is a story about how a system
is working in practice.
											When you put those stories together,
											it gives you a detailed portrait
of the system as a whole.
											People can use that information
											to demand improvements
to laws and policies.
											In India, paralegals and clients
have drawn on their case experience

for the handling of minerals.
											In Kenya, paralegals and clients

											Vivek Maru: Yeah. Anybody remember
the Millennium Development Goals?
											They were adopted in 2000 by the UN
and governments around the world,
											and they were for essential,
laudable things.
											It was reduce child mortality
by two thirds, cut hunger in half,
											crucial things.
											But there was no mention
of justice or fairness
											or accountability or corruption,
											and we have made progress
during the 15 years
											when those goals were in effect,
											but we are way behind
what justice demands,
											and we&#39;re not going to get there
unless we take justice into account.
											And so when the debate started
about the next development framework,
											the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,
											our community came together
around the world
											to argue that access to justice
and legal empowerment
											should be a part of that new framework.
											And there was a lot of resistance.
											Those things are more political,
more contentious than the other ones,
											so we didn&#39;t know until the night before
whether it was going to come through.
											We squeaked by.
											The 16th out of 17 goals
commits to access to justice for all,
											which is a big deal.
											It&#39;s a big deal, yes.
Let&#39;s clap for justice.

											Here&#39;s the scandal, though.
											The day the goals were adopted,
											most of them were accompanied
by big commitments:
											a billion dollars
from the Gates Foundation
											and the British government for nutrition;
											25 billion in public-private financing
for health care for women and children.
											On access to justice,
we had the words on the paper,
											but nobody pledged a penny,
											and so that is the opportunity
and the challenge that we face right now.
											The world recognizes more than ever before
											that you can&#39;t have
development without justice,
											that people can&#39;t improve their lives
if they can&#39;t exercise their rights,

											Number two,
											push your politicians and your governments
to make this a public priority.
											Just like health or education,
access to justice
											should be one of the things
that a government owes its people,
											and we&#39;re nowhere close to that,
											neither in rich countries
or poor countries.
											Number three is:
be a paralegal in your own life.
											Find an injustice
or a problem where you live.
											It&#39;s not hard to find, if you look.
											Is the river being contaminated,
											the one that passes through
the city where you live?
											Are there workers getting paid
less than minimum wage
											or who are working without safety gear?
											Get to know the people most affected,
											find out what the rules say,
											see if you can use those rules
to get a solution.
											If it doesn&#39;t work, see if you can
come together to improve those rules.
											Because if we all start knowing law,
using law and shaping law,
											then we will be building
that deeper version of democracy
											that I believe our world
desperately needs.

And law should be the means by which we translate the ideas that grow out of democratic deliberation (norms) into reality (facts).  This deliberative vision of the law inspires me.

Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions.
