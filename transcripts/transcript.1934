<meta content='How to fix a broken school? Lead fearlessly, love hard' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='On Linda Cliatt-Wayman&#x0027;s first day as principal at a failing high school in North Philadelphia, she was determined to lay down the law. But she soon realized the job was more complex than she thought. With palpable passion, she shares the three principles that helped her turn around three schools labeled "low-performing and persistently dangerous." Her fearless determination to lead — and to love the students, no matter what — is a model for leaders in all fields.' itemprop='description'>

											I graduated from
Philadelphia public schools,

special education for 20 years

											Shortly after I walked into my new school,
											a huge fight broke out among the girls.
											After things were quickly under control,

as the school&#39;s new principal.

											but I was determined
											to set the tone for my new students.
											I started listing as forcefully as I could
											my expectations for their behavior
											and my expectations
for what they would learn in school.
											When, all of a sudden,
											a girl way in the back of the auditorium,
											she stood up
											and she said, &quot;Miss!
											Miss!&quot;
											When our eyes locked, she said,
											&quot;Why do you keep calling this a school?

											In one outburst,

											Fast forwarding a decade later to 2012,
											I was entering my third
low-performing school as principal.
											I was to be Strawberry Mansion&#39;s
fourth principal in four years.
											It was labeled &quot;low-performing
and persistently dangerous&quot;
											due to its low test scores
											and high number of weapons,
											drugs, assaults and arrests.
											Shortly as I approached the door
of my new school
											and attempted to enter,
											and found the door locked with chains,
											I could hear Ashley&#39;s voice in my ears
											going, &quot;Miss! Miss!
											This is not a school.&quot;
											The halls were dim and dark
from poor lighting.
											There were tons of piles
of broken old furniture
											and desks in the classrooms,
											and there were thousands
of unused materials and resources.
											This was not a school.
											As the year progressed,
											I noticed that the classrooms
were nearly empty.
											The students were just scared:
											scared to sit in rows in fear
that something would happen;
											scared because they were often teased
in the cafeteria for eating free food.
											They were scared from all the fighting
and all the bullying.
											This was not a school.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then, there were the teachers,
											who were incredibly afraid
for their own safety,
											so they had low expectations
for the students and themselves,
											and they were totally
unaware of their role
											in the destruction
of the school&#39;s culture.
											This was the most troubling of all.
											You see, Ashley was right,
											and not just about her school.
											For far too many schools,
											for kids who live in poverty,
											their schools are really
not schools at all.
											But this can change.
											Let me tell you how it&#39;s being done
at Strawberry Mansion High School.
											Anybody who&#39;s ever worked
with me will tell you
											I am known for my slogans.
											(Laughter)
											So today, I am going to use three
											that have been paramount
in our quest for change.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											My first slogan is:
											if you&#39;re going to lead, lead.
											I always believed
											that what happens in a school
and what does not happen in a school
											is up to the principal.
											I am the principal,
											and having that title required me to lead.
											I was not going to stay in my office,
											I was not going to delegate my work,
											and I was not going to be afraid
to address anything
											that was not good for children,
											whether that made me liked or not.
											I am a leader,
											so I know I cannot do anything alone.
											So, I assembled
a top-notch leadership team
											who believed in the possibility
of all the children,
											and together, we tackled the small things,
											like resetting every single
locker combination by hand
											so that every student
could have a secure locker.
											We decorated every
bulletin board in that building
											with bright, colorful,
and positive messages.
											We took the chains off
the front doors of the school.
											We got the lightbulbs replaced,
											and we cleaned
every classroom to its core,
											recycling every, every textbook
that was not needed,
											and discarded thousands
of old materials and furniture.
											We used two dumpsters per day.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And, of course, of course,
											we tackled the big stuff,
											like rehauling the entire school budget
											so that we can reallocate funds
to have more teachers and support staff.
											We rebuilt the entire
school day schedule from scratch
											to add a variety of start and end times,
											remediation, honors courses,
											extracurricular activities,
and counseling,
											all during the school day.
											All during the school day.
											We created a deployment plan
											that specified where every single
support person and police officer would be
											every minute of the day,
											and we monitored
at every second of the day,
											and, our best invention ever,
											we devised a schoolwide
discipline program
											titled &quot;Non-negotiables.&quot;
											It was a behavior system —
											designed to promote
positive behavior at all times.

											Strawberry Mansion was removed
from the Persistently Dangerous List

											When we looked at the data,
											and we met with the staff,
											there were many excuses
											for why Strawberry Mansion was
low-performing and persistently dangerous.
											They said that only 68 percent of the kids
come to school on a regular basis,
											100 percent of them live in poverty,
											only one percent
of the parents participate,
											many of the children
											come from incarceration
and single-parent homes,
											39 percent of the students
have special needs,
											and the state data revealed
											that six percent of the students
were proficient in algebra,
											and 10 were proficient in literature.

											After they got through
telling us all the stories

									<p>
											Eliminating excuses at every turn
became my primary responsibility.
											We addressed every one of those excuses
											through a mandatory
professional development,
											paving the way for intense focus
on teaching and learning.
											After many observations,
											what we determined was
that teachers knew what to teach
											but they did not know how to teach
											so many children
with so many vast abilities.
											So, we developed a lesson
delivery model for instruction
											that focused on small group instruction,
											making it possible for all the students
to get their individual needs met
											in the classroom.

											The results?
											After one year, state data revealed

											My students have problems:
											social, emotional and economic problems
											you could never imagine.
											Some of them are parents themselves,
											and some are completely alone.
											If someone asked me my real secret
											for how I truly keep
Strawberry Mansion moving forward,
											I would have to say
that I love my students
											and I believe in their possibilities
											unconditionally.
											When I look at them,
											I can only see what they can become,
											and that is because I am one of them.
											I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too.
											I know what it feels like
to go to a school that&#39;s not a school.
											I know what it feels like to wonder
											if there&#39;s ever going to be
any way out of poverty.
											But because of my amazing mother,
											I got the ability to dream
											despite the poverty that surrounded me.

											So —
											(Applause) —
											if I&#39;m going to push my students

											So I have to spend time with them,
											so I manage the lunchroom every day.
											(Laughter)
											And while I&#39;m there,
											I talk to them
about deeply personal things,
											and when it&#39;s their birthday,
											I sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;
											even though I cannot sing at all.
											(Laughter)
											I often ask them,
											&quot;Why do you want me to sing

											&quot;Why can&#39;t we just do what we want to do?&quot;

of the world tells them they should be,
											we should always provide them with hope,
