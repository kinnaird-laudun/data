<title>Eric Liu: Why ordinary people need to understand power | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Far too many Americans are illiterate in power — what it is, how it operates and why some people have it. As a result, those few who do understand power wield disproportionate influence over everyone else. “We need to make civics sexy again,” says civics educator Eric Liu. “As sexy as it was during the American Revolution or the Civil Rights Movement.”" />

											I&#39;m a teacher and a practitioner
											of civics in America.
											Now, I will kindly ask those of
you who have just fallen asleep
											to please wake up. (Laughter)
											Why is it that the very word &quot;civics&quot;
											has such a soporific, 
even a narcoleptic effect
											on us?
											I think it&#39;s because the very 
word signifies something
											exceedingly virtuous, 
exceedingly important,
											and exceedingly boring.
											Well, I think it&#39;s the responsibility of people like us,
											people who show up for gatherings like this
											in person or online, in any way we can,
											to make civics sexy again,
											as sexy as it was during the American Revolution,
											as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement.
											And I believe the way we make civics sexy again
											is to make explicitly about the teaching of power.
											The way we do that, I believe,
											is at the level of the city.

											This is what I want to talk about today,
											and I want to start by defining some terms
											and then I want to describe the scale
											of the problem I think we face
											and then suggest the ways that I believe cities
											can be the seat of the solution.
											So let me start with some definitions.
											By civics, I simply mean the art
											of being a pro-social, problem-solving contributor
											in a self-governing community.
											Civics is the art of citizenship,
											what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply
											showing up for life,
											and it encompasses three things:
											a foundation of values,
											an understanding of the systems
that make the world go round,
											and a set of skills
											that allow you to pursue goals
											and to have others join in that pursuit.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And that brings me to my definition of power,
											which is simply this:
											the capacity to make others do
											what you would have them do.
											It sounds menacing, doesn&#39;t it?
											We don&#39;t like to talk about power.
											We find it scary. We find it somehow evil.
											We feel uncomfortable naming it.
											In the culture and mythology of democracy,
											power resides with the people.
											Period. End of story.
											Any further inquiry not necessary
											and not really that welcome.
											Power has a negative moral valence.
											It sounds Machiavellian inherently.
											It seems inherently evil.
											But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil
											than fire or physics.
											It just is.
											And power governs
											how any form of government operates,
											whether a democracy or a dictatorship.
											And the problem we face today,
here in America in particular,
											but all around the world,
											is that far too many people 
are profoundly illiterate
											in power —
											what it is, who has it,
											how it operates, how it flows,
											what part of it is visible, 
what part of it is not,
											why some people have it, 
why that&#39;s compounded.
											And as a result of this illiteracy,
											those few who do understand
											how power operates in civic life,
											those who understand
											how a bill becomes a law, yes,
											but also how a friendship 
becomes a subsidy,
											or how a bias becomes a policy,
											or how a slogan becomes a movement,
											the people who understand those things
											wield disproportionate influence,
											and they&#39;re perfectly happy
											to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance
											of the great majority.

									<p>
											This is why it is so fundamental for us right now
											to grab hold of this idea of power
											and to democratize it.
											One of the things that is so profoundly exciting
											and challenging about this moment
											is that as a result of this power illiteracy
											that is so pervasive,
											there is a concentration
											of knowledge, of understanding, of clout.
											I mean, think about it:
											How does a friendship become a subsidy?
											Seamlessly,
											when a senior government official decides
											to leave government and become a lobbyist
											for a private interest
											and convert his or her relationships into capital
											for their new masters.
											How does a bias become a policy?
											Insidiously, just the way that
											stop-and-frisk, for instance,
											became over time a bureaucratic numbers game.
											How does a slogan become a movement?
											Virally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance,
											was able to take the &quot;Don&#39;t Tread on Me&quot; flag
											from the American Revolution,
											or how, on the other side,
											a band of activists could take a magazine headline,
											&quot;Occupy Wall Street,&quot;
											and turn that into a global meme and movement.
											The thing is, though, most people
											aren&#39;t looking for and don&#39;t
want to see these realities.
											So much of this ignorance, this civic illiteracy,
											is willful.
											There are some millennials, for instance,
											who think the whole business is just sordid.
											They don&#39;t want to have anything to do with politics.
											They&#39;d rather just opt out
											and engage in volunteerism.
											There are some techies out there
											who believe that the cure-all
											for any power imbalance or power abuse
											is simply more data,
											more transparency.
											There are some on the left who think power resides
											only with corporations,
											and some on the right who think power
											resides only with government,
											each side blinded by their selective outrage.
											There are the naive who believe that
											good things just happen
											and the cynical who believe
that bad things just happen,
											the fortunate and unfortunate alike
											who think that their lot is simply what they deserve
											rather than the eminently alterable result
											of a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation,

											As a result of all of this
creeping fatalism in public life,
											we here, particularly in America today,
											have depressingly low levels
											of civic knowledge, civic engagement, participation,
											awareness.
											The whole business of politics has been
											effectively subcontracted out
to a band of professionals,
											money people, outreach people,
											message people, research people.
											The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs
											in the sense of suckers.
											We become demotivated to learn more
											about how things work.
											We begin to opt out.

											Well, this problem, this challenge,
											is a thing that we must now confront,
											and I believe that when you have
											this kind of disengagement, this willful ignorance,
											it becomes both a cause and a consequence
											of this concentration of opportunity
											of wealth and clout that I was
describing a moment ago,
											this profound civic inequality.
											This is why it is so important in our time right now
											to reimagine civics as the teaching of power.
											Perhaps it&#39;s never been more important
											at any time in our lifetimes.
											If people don&#39;t learn power,
											people don&#39;t wake up,
											and if they don&#39;t wake up,
											they get left out.

									<p>
											Now, part of the art of practicing power
											means being awake and having a voice,
											but it also is about having an arena
											where you can plausibly practice deciding.
											All of civics boils down to the simple question
											of who decides,
											and you have to play that out
											in a place, in an arena.

											And this brings me to the third
point that I want to make today,
											which is simply that there is no better arena
											in our time for the practicing of power
											than the city.
											Think about the city where you live,
											where you&#39;re from.
											Think about a problem in
the common life of your city.
											It can be something small,
											like where a street lamp should go,
											or something medium like
											which library should have its hours extended or cut,
											or maybe something bigger,
											like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be
											turned into a highway or a greenway,
											or whether all the businesses in your town
											should be required to pay a living wage.
											Think about the change that you want in your city,
											and then think about how you would get it,
											how you would make it happen.
											Take an inventory of all the forms of power
											that are at play in your city&#39;s situation:
											money, of course, people, yes,
											ideas, information, misinformation,
											the threat of force, the force of norms.
											All of these form of power are at play.
											Now think about how you would activate
											or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power.

											This is not some Game of Thrones
											empire-level set of questions.
											These are questions that play out
											in every single place on the planet.
											I&#39;ll just tell you quickly about two stories
											drawn from recent headlines.
											In Boulder, Colorado,
											voters not too long ago approved a process
											to replace the private power company,
											literally the power company,
the electric company Xcel,
											with a publicly owned utility
											that would forego profits
											and attend far more to climate change.
											Well, Xcel fought back,
											and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure
											that would undermine or undo
											this municipalization.
											And so the citizen activists in
Boulder who have been pushing this
											now literally have to fight the power
											in order to fight for power.
											In Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama,
											there&#39;s an organization on campus
											called, kind of menacingly, the Machine,
											and it draws from largely white sororities
											and fraternities on campus,
											and for decades, the Machine has dominated
											student government elections.
											Well now, recently, the Machine
											has started to get involved
											in actual city politics,
											and they&#39;ve engineered the election
											of a former Machine member,
											a young, pro-business recent graduate
											to the Tuscaloosa city school board.
											Now, as I say, these are just two examples
											drawn almost at random from the headlines.
											Every day, there are thousands more like them.
											And you may like or dislike
											the efforts I&#39;m describing here
											in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa,
											but you cannot help but admire
											the power literacy of the players involved,
											their skill.
											You cannot help but reckon with and recognize
											the command they have
											of the elemental questions
											of civic power —
											what objective, what strategy, what tactics,
											what is the terrain, who are your enemies,
											who are your allies?
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now I want you to return
											to thinking about that problem or that opportunity
											or that challenge in your city,
											and the thing it was that you want to fix
											or create in your city,
											and ask yourself,
											do you have command of these
elemental questions of power?
											Could you put into practice effectively
											what it is that you know?
											This is the challenge and the opportunity for us.

											We live in a time right now
											where in spite of globalization
											or perhaps because of globalization,
											all citizenship is ever more resonantly,
											powerfully local.
											Indeed, power in our time is flowing
											ever faster to the city.
											Here in the United States, the national government
											has tied itself up in partisan knots.
											Civic imagination and innovation and creativity
											are emerging from local ecosystems now
											and radiating outward,
											and this great innovation,
											this great wave
											of localism that&#39;s now arriving,
											and you see it in how people eat
											and work and share and buy and move
											and live their everyday lives,
											this isn&#39;t some precious parochialism,
											this isn&#39;t some retreat into insularity, no.
											This is emergent.
											The localism of our time is networked powerfully.
											And so, for instance,
											consider the ways that strategies
											for making cities more bike-friendly
											have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen
											to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle.
											Think about how experiments
in participatory budgeting,
											where everyday citizens get a chance
											to allocate and decide upon
											the allocation of city funds.
											Those experiments have
spread from Porto Alegre, Brazil
											to here in New York City, 
to the wards of Chicago.
											Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles
											and many cities between
											are now organizing to stage strikes
											to remind the people who live in their cities
											what a day without immigrants would look like.
											In China, all across that country,
											members of the New Citizens&#39; Movement
											are beginning to activate and organize
											to fight official corruption and graft,
											and they&#39;re drawing the ire of officials there,
											but they&#39;re also drawing the attention
											of anti-corruption activists all around the world.
											In Seattle, where I&#39;m from,
											we&#39;ve become part of a great global array of cities
											that are now working together
											bypassing government altogether,
											national government altogether,
											in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals
											of the Kyoto Protocol.
											All of these citizens, united,
											are forming a web,
											a great archipelago of power
											that allows us to bypass
											brokenness and monopolies of control.

											And our task now is to accelerate this work.
											Our task now is to bring more and more people
											into the fold of this work.
											That&#39;s why my organization, Citizen University,
											has undertaken a project now
											to create an everyman&#39;s curriculum
											in civic power.
											And this curriculum starts with this triad
											that I described earlier of values,
											systems and skills.
											And what I&#39;d like to do is to invite all of you
											to help create this curriculum
											with the stories and the experiences
											and the challenges that each of you lives and faces,
											to create something powerfully collective.
											And I want to invite you in particular to try
											a simple exercise drawn
											from the early frameworks of this curriculum.
											I want you to write a narrative,
											a narrative from the future of your city,
											and you can date it, set it out one year from now,
											five years from now, a decade from now,
											a generation from now,
											and write it as a case study looking back,
											looking back at the change
											that you wanted in your city,
											looking back at the cause
that you were championing,
											and describing the ways that that change
											and that cause came, in fact, to succeed.
											Describe the values
											of your fellow citizens that you activated,
											and the sense of moral purpose
that you were able to stir.
											Recount all the different ways
											that you engaged the systems of government,
											of the marketplace,
											of social institutions, of faith organizations,
											of the media.
											Catalog all the skills you had to deploy,
											how to negotiate, how to advocate,
											how to frame issues,
											how to navigate diversity in conflict,
											all those skills that enabled you
											to bring folks on board
											and to overcome resistance.
											What you&#39;ll be doing when you write that narrative
											is you&#39;ll be discovering how to read power,
											and in the process, how to write power.
											So share what you write,
											do you what you write,
											and then share what you do.
											I invite you to literally share
											the narratives that you create
											on our Facebook page for Citizen University.
											But even beyond that, it&#39;s in the conversations
											that we have today
											all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings
											that are happening on this topic at this moment,
											and to think about how we can become
											one another&#39;s teachers and students in power.
											If we do that, then together
											we can make civics sexy again.
											Together, we can democratize democracy
											and make it safe again for amateurs.
											Together, we can create a great network of city
											that will be the most powerful collective laboratory
											for self-government this planet has ever seen.
											We have the power to do that.
