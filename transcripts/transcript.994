											So before I get started,

											No, liespotters are armed

											They use it to get to the truth,

leaders do everyday;
											they have difficult conversations
with difficult people,
											sometimes during very difficult times.
											And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition,
											and that proposition is the following:
											Lying is a cooperative act.
											Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance.
											Its power emerges
											when someone else agrees
to believe the lie.

											Sometimes we&#39;re willing

											for the sake of social dignity,

be kept secret, secret.

											PM: Okay, those head shakes

											And as I promised, we&#39;re now going
to look at what the truth looks like.
											But I&#39;m going to show you two videos,
											two mothers — one is lying,
one is telling the truth.
											And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California.
											And I think they&#39;re an excellent example
of what the truth looks like.

											Now the technology
around what the truth looks like
											is progressing on, the science of it.
											We know, for example,
											that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans,
											MRI&#39;s that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out
											when we&#39;re trying to be deceptive.
											And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us
											as panaceas for deceit,
											and they will prove
incredibly useful some day.
											But you&#39;ve got to ask yourself
in the meantime:
											Who do you want on your side
of the meeting,
											someone who&#39;s trained
in getting to the truth
											or some guy who&#39;s going to drag

											Liespotters rely on human tools.
											They know, as someone once said,
											&quot;Character&#39;s who you are in the dark.&quot;
											And what&#39;s kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness.
											Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.
											It&#39;s transparent
with blogs and social networks
											broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people
											that have made a choice to live
their lives in public.
											It&#39;s a much more noisy world.
											So one challenge we have is to remember,
											oversharing, that&#39;s not honesty.
											Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us
											to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency — character integrity —
											that&#39;s still what matters,
that&#39;s always what&#39;s going to matter.
											So in this much noisier world,
											it might make sense for us
											to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code.

									<p>
											When you combine the science
of recognizing deception
											with the art of looking, listening,
											you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie.
											You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit,
											because you signal to everyone around you,
											you say, &quot;Hey, my world, our world,
it&#39;s going to be an honest one.
											My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened
											and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized.&quot;

to shift just a little bit.

take back the truth.","whylisten":"Social media expert Pamela Meyer can tell when you&rsquo;re lying. If it&rsquo;s not your words that give you away, it&rsquo;s your posture, eyes, breathing rate, fidgets, and a host of other indicators. Worse, we are all lied to up to 200 times a day, she says, from the white lies that allow society to function smoothly to the devastating duplicities that bring down corporations and break up families. <br /><br />Working with a team of researchers over several years, Meyer, who is CEO of social networking company Simpatico Networks, collected and reviewed most of the research on deception that has been published, from such fields as law-enforcement, military, psychology and espionage. She then became an expert herself, receiving advanced training in deception detection, including multiple courses of advanced training in interrogation, microexpression analysis, statement analysis, behavior and body language interpretation, and emotion recognition. Her research is synthetized in her bestselling book Liespotting."}],"speaker_name":"Pamela Meyer","tags":["culture","psychology","science","society"],"title":"How to spot a liar","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":18470566}]}
