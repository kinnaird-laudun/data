											Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.
											Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments,
											and I realized that I almost became a scientist.
											When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set
											and I decided to make water.
											(Laughter)
											So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,
											and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker
											and I threw a match in.
											(Laughter)
											And the glass — luckily I turned around —
											I had it all in my back
											and I was about 15 feet away.
											The wall was covered with ...
											I had an explosion.

											I&#39;d like to start
											this session again.
											The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous,
											Frank Gehry.
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											And Frank, you&#39;ve come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.
											I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect,
											to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.
											I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it
											because it&#39;s a funny ... you know, it&#39;s a strange thought,
											but your building is an icon —
											you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads —
											and you&#39;ve had not rock star status, but celebrity status
											in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.
											And I know the road was extremely difficult.
											And it didn&#39;t seem, at least, that your sell outs,
											whatever they were, were very big.
											You kept moving ahead in a life where you&#39;re dependent
											on working for somebody.
											But that&#39;s an interesting thing for a creative person.
											A lot of us work for people;
											we&#39;re in the hands of other people.
											And that&#39;s one of the great dilemmas — we&#39;re in a creativity session —
											it&#39;s one of the great dilemmas in creativity:
											how to do work that&#39;s big enough and not sell out.
											And you&#39;ve achieved that
											and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.
											It&#39;s not quite a question but you can comment on it.
											It&#39;s a big issue.

											FG: Well, I&#39;ve always just ...
											I&#39;ve never really gone out looking for work.
											I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.
											And when I started out,
											I thought that architecture was a service business
											and that you had to please the clients and stuff.
											And I realized when I&#39;d come into the meetings
											with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff,
											and people would just look at me
											like I&#39;d just landed from Mars.
											But I couldn&#39;t do anything else.
											That was my response to the people in the time.
											And actually, it was responding to clients that I had
											who didn&#39;t have very much money, so they couldn&#39;t afford very much.
											I think it was circumstantial.

											Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.
											We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica
											and for like 50 grand I built a house around it.
											And a few people got excited about it.
											I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer,
											out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.
											He&#39;s building this huge concrete place.
											And it was late in the evening. We&#39;d had a lot to drink.
											We were standing out in the desert all alone and,
											thinking about my house, he said,
											&quot;Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent,
											somewhere in 2000 years somebody&#39;s going to like it?&quot;
											(Laughter)
											So, I thought, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s probably a good idea.&quot;
											Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money,
											so the stuff was a little more permanent.
											But I just found out the world ain&#39;t going to last that long,
											this guy was telling us the other day.
											So where do we go now?
											Back to — everything&#39;s so temporary.

									<p>
											I don&#39;t see it the way you characterized it.
											For me, every day is a new thing.
											I approach each project with a new insecurity,
											almost like the first project I ever did,
											and I get the sweats,
											I go in and start working, I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going —
											if I knew where I was going, I wouldn&#39;t do it.
											When I can predict or plan it, I don&#39;t do it.
											I discard it.
											So I approach it with the same trepidation.
											Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence
											that it&#39;s going to be OK.
											I do run a kind of a business —
											I&#39;ve got 120 people
											and you&#39;ve got to pay them,
											so there&#39;s a lot of responsibility involved —
											but the actual work on the project is with,
											I think, a healthy insecurity.

											And like the playwright said the other day — I could relate to him:
											you&#39;re not sure.
											When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it,
											I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...
											They weren&#39;t mistakes;
											I saw everything that I would have changed
											and I was embarrassed by it.
											I felt an embarrassment — &quot;How could I have done that?
											How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?&quot;
											It&#39;s taken several years to now look at it detached and say —
											as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road
											and the street, and it appears to have a relationship —
											that I started to like it.

											Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal
											and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.
											I visited with him a few years ago
											and he showed me his early work,
											and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.
											When I came out of college,
											I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,
											and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs
											and things like that.
											I tried to understand that language as a beginning,
											as a place to jump off,
											and there was so much of it being done by spec builders
											and it was trivialized so much that it wasn&#39;t ...
											I just stopped.
											I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it,
											but it didn&#39;t feel good to me.
											Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal
											where the real stuff was
											and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.
											And I always felt that he should come to Southern California
											and do a building.
											I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn&#39;t pan out.
											I like the idea of collaboration with people like that
											because it pushes you.
											I&#39;ve done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra,
											who doesn&#39;t think architecture is art.
											Did you see that thing?

											I asked them what kind of building it was.
											&quot;When you get here we&#39;ll explain it.&quot; Blah, blah, blah.
											So four of us went.
											And they took us — they put us up in a great hotel
											and we were looking over the bay,
											and then they took us in a boat out in the water
											and showed us all these sights in the harbor.
											Each one was more beautiful than the other.
											And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor
											and we were going to have dinner with
											the most important people in Malaga.
											Just before going to lunch with the mayor,
											we went to the harbor commissioner.
											It was a table as long as this carpet
											and the harbor commissioner was here,
											and I was here, and my guys.
											We sat down, and we had a drink of water
											and everybody was quiet.
