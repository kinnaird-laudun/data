<title>Sandi Toksvig: A political party for women&#39;s equality | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Women&#39;s equality won&#39;t just happen -- not unless more women are put in positions of power, says Sandi Toksvig. In a disarmingly hilarious talk, Toksvig tells the story of how she helped start a new political party in Britain, the Women&#39;s Equality Party, with the express purpose of putting equality on the ballot. Now she hopes people around the world will copy her party&#39;s model and mobilize for equality." />

<meta content="Women's equality won't just happen — not unless more women are put in positions of power, says Sandi Toksvig. In a disarmingly hilarious talk, Toksvig tells the story of how she helped start a new political party in Britain, the Women's Equality Party, with the express purpose of putting equality on the ballot. Now she hopes people around the world will copy her party's model and mobilize for equality." itemprop='description'>

I work on television in Britain.

I was already hosting my own shows

											I love what I do,

											And I didn&#39;t want them
to grow up with a secret.
											1994, when my son, my youngest was born,
											there was not, as far as I was aware,
											a single out, gay woman
in British public life.
											I don&#39;t think secrets are a good thing.

that I would never work again,

absolutely worth the risk.
											Well, it was hell.
											In Britain, we have a particularly vicious
section of the right-wing press,
											and they went nuts.
											And their hatred stirred up
the less stable elements of society,
											and we got death threats —
											enough death threats
that I had to take the kids into hiding,
											and we had to have police protection.
											And I promise you there were
many moments in the still of the night

											Eventually the dust settled.
											Against all expectation
I carried on working,
											and my kids were and continue
to be absolutely fantastic.
											I remember when my son was six,
he had a friend over to play.
											They were in the next room;
I could hear them chatting.
											The friend said to my son,
&quot;What&#39;s it like having two mums?&quot;
											I was a little anxious to hear,
so I leant in to hear and my son said,
											&quot;It&#39;s fantastic,
