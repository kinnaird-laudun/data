<title>Jared Diamond: How societies can grow old better | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: There&#39;s an irony behind the latest efforts to extend human life: It&#39;s no picnic to be an old person in a youth-oriented society. Older people can become isolated, lacking meaningful work and low on funds. In this intriguing talk, Jared Diamond looks at how many different societies treat their elders -- some better, some worse -- and suggests we all take advantage of experience." />

<meta content="There's an irony behind the latest efforts to extend human life: It's no picnic to be an old person in a youth-oriented society. Older people can become isolated, lacking meaningful work and low on funds. In this intriguing talk, Jared Diamond looks at how many different societies treat their elders — some better, some worse — and suggests we all take advantage of experience." itemprop='description'>

											I&#39;m going to talk about growing older
											in traditional societies.
											This subject constitutes just one chapter
											of my latest book, which compares
											traditional, small, tribal societies
											with our large, modern societies,
											with respect to many topics
											such as bringing up children,
											growing older, health, dealing with danger,
											settling disputes, religion
											and speaking more than one language.

											Those tribal societies, which constituted
											all human societies for most of human history,
											are far more diverse than are our modern,
											recent, big societies.
											All big societies that have governments,
											and where most people are strangers to each other,
											are inevitably similar to each other
											and different from tribal societies.
											Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments
											in how to run a human society.
											They constitute experiments from which we ourselves
											may be able to learn.
											Tribal societies shouldn&#39;t be scorned
											as primitive and miserable,
											but also they shouldn&#39;t be romanticized
											as happy and peaceful.
											When we learn of tribal practices,
											some of them will horrify us,
											but there are other tribal practices which,
											when we hear about them,
											we may admire and envy
											and wonder whether we could adopt those practices
											ourselves.

											Most old people in the U.S. end up living
											separately from their children
											and from most of their friends
											of their earlier years,
											and often they live in separate
retirements homes for the elderly,
											whereas in traditional societies,
											older people instead live out their lives
											among their children, their other relatives,
											and their lifelong friends.
											Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly
											varies enormously among traditional societies,
											from much worse to much better
											than in our modern societies.

											At the worst extreme, many traditional societies
											get rid of their elderly
											in one of four increasingly direct ways:
											by neglecting their elderly
											and not feeding or cleaning them until they die,
											or by abandoning them when the group moves,
											or by encouraging older people to commit suicide,
											or by killing older people.
											In which tribal societies do children
											abandon or kill their parents?
											It happens mainly under two conditions.
											One is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies
											that often shift camp
											and that are physically incapable
											of transporting old people who can&#39;t walk
											when the able-bodied younger people already
											have to carry their young children
											and all their physical possessions.
											The other condition is in societies
											living in marginal or fluctuating environments,
											such as the Arctic or deserts,
											where there are periodic food shortages,
											and occasionally there just isn&#39;t enough food
											to keep everyone alive.
											Whatever food is available has to be reserved
											for able-bodied adults and for children.
											To us Americans, it sounds horrible
											to think of abandoning or killing
											your own sick wife or husband
											or elderly mother or father,
											but what could those traditional societies
											do differently?
											They face a cruel situation of no choice.
											Their old people had to do it to their own parents,
											and the old people know
											what now is going to happen to them.

											At the opposite extreme
											in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,
											are the New Guinea farming societies
											where I&#39;ve been doing my fieldwork 
for the past 50 years,
											and most other sedentary traditional societies
											around the world.
											In those societies, older people are cared for.
											They are fed. They remain valuable.
											And they continue to live in the same hut
											or else in a nearby hut near their children,
											relatives and lifelong friends.

											There are two main sets of reasons for this variation
											among societies in their treatment
											of old people.
											The variation depends especially
											on the usefulness of old people
											and on the society&#39;s values.

											First, as regards usefulness,
											older people continue to perform useful services.
											One use of older people in traditional societies
											is that they often are still effective
											at producing food.
											Another traditional usefulness of older people
											is that they are capable of babysitting
											their grandchildren,
											thereby freeing up their own adult children,
											the parents of those grandchildren,
											to go hunting and gathering
food for the grandchildren.
											Still another traditional value of older people
											is in making tools, weapons, baskets,
											pots and textiles.
											In fact, they&#39;re usually the people who are best at it.
											Older people usually are the leaders
											of traditional societies,
											and the people most knowledgeable about politics,
											medicine, religion, songs and dances.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Finally, older people in traditional societies
											have a huge significance that would never occur
											to us in our modern, literate societies,
											where our sources of information are books
											and the Internet.
											In contrast, in traditional societies without writing,
											older people are the repositories of information.
											It&#39;s their knowledge that spells the difference
											between survival and death for their whole society
											in a time of crisis caused by rare events
											for which only the oldest people alive
											have had experience.
											Those, then, are the ways in which older people
											are useful in traditional societies.
											Their usefulness varies and contributes
											to variation in the society&#39;s treatment
											of the elderly.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The other set of reasons for variation
											in the treatment of the elderly is
											the society&#39;s cultural values.
											For example, there&#39;s particular emphasis
											on respect for the elderly in East Asia,
											associated with Confucius&#39; doctrine
											of filial piety, which means obedience,
											respect and support for elderly parents.
											Cultural values that emphasize
respect for older people
											contrast with the low status of the elderly
											in the U.S.
											Older Americans are at a big disadvantage
											in job applications.
											They&#39;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals.
											Our hospitals have an explicit policy
											called age-based allocation of healthcare resources.
											That sinister expression means that
											if hospital resources are limited,
											for example if only one donor heart
											becomes available for transplant,
											or if a surgeon has time to operate
											on only a certain number of patients,
											American hospitals have an explicit policy
											of giving preference to younger patients
											over older patients
											on the grounds that younger patients are considered
											more valuable to society
											because they have more years of life ahead of them,
											even though the younger patients have fewer years
											of valuable life experience behind them.
											There are several reasons for this low status
											of the elderly in the U.S.
											One is our Protestant work ethic
											which places high value on work,
											so older people who are no longer working
											aren&#39;t respected.
											Another reason is our American emphasis
											on the virtues of self-reliance and independence,
											so we instinctively look down on older people
											who are no longer self-reliant and independent.
											Still a third reason is our American cult of youth,
											which shows up even in our advertisements.
											Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict
											smiling young people,
											even though old as well as young people
											buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.
											Just think, what&#39;s the last time you saw
											a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people
											85 years old? Never.
											Instead, the only American ads
											featuring white-haired old people
											are ads for retirement homes and pension planning.

									<p>
											Well, what has changed in the status
											of the elderly today
											compared to their status in traditional societies?
											There have been a few changes for the better
											and more changes for the worse.
											Big changes for the better
											include the fact that today we enjoy
											much longer lives,
											much better health in our old age,
											and much better recreational opportunities.
											Another change for the better is that we now have
											specialized retirement facilities
											and programs to take care of old people.
											Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality
											that we now have
											more old people and fewer young people
											than at any time in the past.
											That means that all those old people
											are more of a burden on the few young people,
											and that each old person has less individual value.
											Another big change for the worse
in the status of the elderly
											is the breaking of social ties with age,
											because older people, their children,
											and their friends,
											all move and scatter independently of each other
											many times during their lives.
											We Americans move on the average
											every five years.
											Hence our older people are likely
											to end up living distant from their children
											and the friends of their youth.
											Yet another change for the worse
in the status of the elderly
											is formal retirement from the workforce,
											carrying with it a loss of work friendships
											and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.
											Perhaps the biggest change for the worse
											is that our elderly are objectively
											less useful than in traditional societies.
											Widespread literacy means that they are no longer
											useful as repositories of knowledge.
											When we want some information,
											we look it up in a book or we Google it
											instead of finding some old person to ask.
											The slow pace of technological change
											in traditional societies
											means that what someone learns there as a child
											is still useful when that person is old,
											but the rapid pace of technological change today
											means that what we learn as children
											is no longer useful 60 years later.
											And conversely, we older people are not fluent
											in the technologies essential for surviving
											in modern society.
											For example, as a 15-year-old,
											I was considered outstandingly
good at multiplying numbers
											because I had memorized the multiplication tables
											and I know how to use logarithms
											and I&#39;m quick at manipulating a slide rule.
											Today, though, those skills are utterly useless
											because any idiot
											can now multiply eight-digit numbers
											accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.
											Conversely, I at age 75
											am incompetent at skills
											essential for everyday life.
											My family&#39;s first TV set in 1948
											had only three knobs that I quickly mastered:
											an on-off switch, a volume knob,
											and a channel selector knob.
											Today, just to watch a program
											on the TV set in my own house,
											I have to operate a 41-button TV remote
											that utterly defeats me.
											I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons
											and ask them to talk me through it
											while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.

											What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly
											in the U.S., and to make better use of their value?
											That&#39;s a huge problem.
											In my remaining four minutes today,
											I can offer just a few suggestions.
											One value of older people is that they are
											increasingly useful as grandparents
											for offering high-quality childcare
											to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,
											as more young women enter the workforce
											and as fewer young parents of either gender
											stay home as full-time caretakers of their children.
											Compared to the usual alternatives
											of paid babysitters and day care centers,
											grandparents offer superior, motivated,
											experienced child care.
											They&#39;ve already gained experience
from raising their own children.
											They usually love their grandchildren,
											and are eager to spend time with them.
											Unlike other caregivers,
											grandparents don&#39;t quit their job
											because they found another job with higher pay
											looking after another baby.
											A second value of older people is paradoxically
											related to their loss of value
											as a result of changing world
conditions and technology.
											At the same time, older people have gained
											in value today precisely because
											of their unique experience of living conditions
											that have now become rare
											because of rapid change, but that could come back.
											For example, only Americans now in their 70s
											or older today can remember
											the experience of living through a great depression,
											the experience of living through a world war,
											and agonizing whether or not
											dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible
											than the likely consequences
of not dropping atomic bombs.
											Most of our current voters and politicians
											have no personal experience of any of those things,
											but millions of older Americans do.
											Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations
											could come back.
											Even if they don&#39;t come back,
											we have to be able to plan for them
											on the basis of the experience of what they were like.
											Older people have that experience.
											Younger people don&#39;t.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The remaining value of older people
											that I&#39;ll mention involves recognizing that
											while there are many things that older people
											can no longer do,
											there are other things that they can do
											better than younger people.
											A challenge for society is 
to make use of those things
											that older people are better at doing.
											Some abilities, of course, decrease with age.
											Those include abilities at tasks
											requiring physical strength and stamina,
											ambition, and the power of novel reasoning
											in a circumscribed situation,
											such as figuring out the structure of DNA,
											best left to scientists under the age of 30.
											Conversely, valuable attributes
											that increase with age include experience,
											understanding of people and human relationships,
											ability to help other people
											without your own ego getting in the way,
											and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,
											such as economics and comparative history,
											best left to scholars over the age of 60.
											Hence older people are
much better than younger people
											at supervising, administering, advising,
											strategizing, teaching, synthesizing,
											and devising long-term plans.
											I&#39;ve seen this value of older people
											with so many of my friends in their 60s,
											70s, 80s and 90s,
											who are still active as investment managers,
											farmers, lawyers and doctors.
											In short, many traditional societies
											make better use of their elderly
											and give their elderly more satisfying lives
											than we do in modern, big societies.

											Paradoxically nowadays,
											when we have more elderly people than ever before,
											living healthier lives and with better medical care
											than ever before,
											old age is in some respects more miserable
											than ever before.
											The lives of the elderly are widely recognized
											as constituting a disaster area
											of modern American society.
											We can surely do better by learning
											from the lives of the elderly
											in traditional societies.
											But what&#39;s true of the lives of the elderly
											in traditional societies
											is true of many other features
											of traditional societies as well.
											Of course, I&#39;m not advocating that we all give up
											agriculture and metal tools
											and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
											There are many obvious respects
											in which our lives today are far happier
											than those in small, traditional societies.
											To mention just a few examples,
											our lives are longer, materially much richer,
											and less plagued by violence
											than are the lives of people in traditional societies.
											But there are also things to be admired
											about people in traditional societies,
											and perhaps to be learned from them.
											Their lives are usually socially much richer
											than our lives,
											although materially poorer.
											Their children are more self-confident,
											more independent, and more socially skilled
											than are our children.
											They think more realistically
about dangers than we do.
											They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease,
											stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases
											that will be the causes of death of almost
											all of us in this room today.
											Features of the modern lifestyle
predispose us to those diseases,
											and features of the traditional lifestyle
											protect us against them.
