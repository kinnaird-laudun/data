<title>Dan Pallotta: The way we think about charity is dead wrong | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Activist and fundraiser Dan Pallotta calls out the double standard that drives our broken relationship to charities. Too many nonprofits, he says, are rewarded for how little they spend -- not for what they get done. Instead of equating frugality with morality, he asks us to start rewarding charities for their big goals and big accomplishments (even if that comes with big expenses). In this bold talk, he says: Let&#39;s change the way we think about changing the world." />

<meta content='The way we think about charity is dead wrong' itemprop='name'>
<meta content="Activist and fundraiser Dan Pallotta calls out the double standard that drives our broken relationship to charities. Too many nonprofits, he says, are rewarded for how little they spend — not for what they get done. Instead of equating frugality with morality, he asks us to start rewarding charities for their big goals and big accomplishments (even if that comes with big expenses). In this bold talk, he says: Let's change the way we think about changing the world." itemprop='description'>

											The real social innovation I want
to talk about involves charity.
											I want to talk about how the things
we&#39;ve been taught to think
											about giving and about charity
											and about the nonprofit sector,
											are actually undermining
the causes we love,
											and our profound yearning
to change the world.

									<p>
											But before I do that,
I want to ask if we even believe
											that the nonprofit sector
has any serious role to play
											in changing the world.
											A lot of people say now that business
will lift up the developing economies,
											and social business
will take care of the rest.
											And I do believe that business will move
the great mass of humanity forward.
											But it always leaves behind
that 10 percent or more
											that is most disadvantaged or unlucky.
											And social business needs markets,
											and there are some issues
for which you just can&#39;t develop
											the kind of money measures
that you need for a market.

									<p>
											I sit on the board of a center
for the developmentally disabled,
											and these people want laughter
											and compassion and they want love.
											How do you monetize that?
											And that&#39;s where the nonprofit sector
and philanthropy come in.
											Philanthropy is the market for love.
											It is the market for all those people
											for whom there is no other market coming.
											And so if we really want,
like Buckminster Fuller said,
											a world that works for everyone,
											with no one and nothing left out,
											then the nonprofit sector has to be
											a serious part of the conversation.

											The third area of discrimination
is the taking of risk
											in pursuit of new ideas
for generating revenue.
											So Disney can make a new

											But you do a little $1 million
community fundraiser for the poor,

to the cause in the first 12 months,

is called into question.
											So nonprofits are really reluctant
to attempt any brave,
											daring, giant-scale
new fundraising endeavors,
											for fear that if the thing fails,
											their reputations will be dragged
through the mud.
											Well, you and I know
											when you prohibit failure,
you kill innovation.
											If you kill innovation in fundraising,
you can&#39;t raise more revenue;
											if you can&#39;t raise more revenue,
you can&#39;t grow;

											The fourth area is time.
											So Amazon went for six years
without returning any profit to investors,
											and people had patience.
											They knew that there was a long-term
objective down the line,
											of building market dominance.
											But if a nonprofit organization
ever had a dream
											of building magnificent scale
that required that for six years,
											no money was going to go to the needy,
											it was all going to be invested
in building this scale,

											The last area is profit itself.
											So the for-profit sector
can pay people profits
											in order to attract their capital
for their new ideas,
											but you can&#39;t pay profits
in a nonprofit sector,
											so the for-profit sector has a lock
											on the multi-trillion-dollar
capital markets,

for growth and risk and idea capital.

											Well, you put those
five things together —
											you can&#39;t use money to lure talent
away from the for-profit sector;
											you can&#39;t advertise
on anywhere near the scale
											the for-profit sector
does for new customers;
											you can&#39;t take the kinds of risks
in pursuit of those customers
											that the for-profit sector takes;
											you don&#39;t have the same amount of time
to find them as the for-profit sector;
											and you don&#39;t have a stock market
with which to fund any of this,
											even if you could do it
in the first place —
											and you&#39;ve just put the nonprofit sector
											at an extreme disadvantage
to the for-profit sector,
											on every level.
											If we have any doubts about the effects
of this separate rule book,
											this statistic is sobering:
											From 1970 to 2009,
											the number of nonprofits that really grew,
											that crossed the $50 million
annual revenue barrier,
											is 144.
											In the same time, the number
of for-profits that crossed it
											is 46,136.
											So we&#39;re dealing with social problems
that are massive in scale,

can&#39;t generate any scale.
											All of the scale goes

											So why do we think this way?
											Well, like most fanatical
dogma in America,
											these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.
											The Puritans came here
for religious reasons, or so they said,
											but they also came here because
they wanted to make a lot of money.
											They were pious people,
											but they were also
really aggressive capitalists,
											and they were accused of extreme forms
of profit-making tendencies,
											compared to the other colonists.
											But at the same time,
the Puritans were Calvinists,
											so they were taught literally
to hate themselves.
											They were taught
that self-interest was a raging sea
											that was a sure path to eternal damnation.
											This created a real problem
for these people.
											Here they&#39;ve come all the way across
the Atlantic to make all this money,
											but making all this money
will get you sent directly to Hell.

											Well, charity became their answer.
											It became this economic sanctuary,
											where they could do penance
for their profit-making tendencies —
											at five cents on the dollar.
											So of course, how could you
make money in charity
											if charity was your penance
for making money?
											Financial incentive was exiled
from the realm of helping others,
											so that it could thrive in the area
of making money for yourself,

											Now, this ideology gets policed
by this one very dangerous question,
											which is, &quot;What percentage of my donation
goes to the cause versus overhead?&quot;
											There are a lot of problems
with this question.
											I&#39;m going to just focus on two.
											First, it makes us think
that overhead is a negative,
											that it is somehow not part of the cause.
											But it absolutely is, especially
if it&#39;s being used for growth.
											Now, this idea that overhead
is somehow an enemy of the cause
											creates this second, much larger problem,
											which is, it forces organizations
to go without the overhead things
											they really need to grow,
											in the interest of keeping overhead low.

											So we&#39;ve all been taught
that charities should spend
											as little as possible on overhead
things like fundraising
											under the theory that, well, the less
money you spend on fundraising,
											the more money there is
available for the cause.
											Well, that&#39;s true
if it&#39;s a depressing world
											in which this pie cannot
be made any bigger.
											But if it&#39;s a logical world
in which investment in fundraising
											actually raises more funds
and makes the pie bigger,
											then we have it precisely backwards,
											and we should be investing more money,
not less, in fundraising,
											because fundraising is the one thing
											that has the potential
to multiply the amount of money
											available for the cause
that we care about so deeply.

											I&#39;ll give you two examples.
											We launched the AIDSRides
											with an initial investment
of 50,000 dollars in risk capital.
											Within nine years,
we had multiplied that 1,982 times,
											into 108 million dollars
after all expenses, for AIDS services.
											We launched the breast cancer three-days
											with an initial investment
of 350,000 dollars in risk capital.
											Within just five years,
we had multiplied that 554 times,
											into 194 million dollars
after all expenses,
											for breast cancer research.
											Now, if you were a philanthropist
really interested in breast cancer,
											what would make more sense:
											go out and find the most innovative
researcher in the world
											and give her 350,000 dollars for research,
											or give her fundraising
department the 350,000 dollars
											to multiply it into 194 million dollars
for breast cancer research?
											2002 was our most successful year ever.
											We netted for breast cancer
alone, that year alone,

											Here&#39;s how all of this
impacts the big picture.
											I said that charitable giving is
two percent of GDP in the United States.
											That&#39;s about 300 billion dollars a year.
											But only about 20 percent of that,
or 60 billion dollars,
											goes to health and human services causes.
											The rest goes to religion
and higher education and hospitals,
											and that 60 billion dollars
is not nearly enough
											to tackle these problems.
											But if we could move charitable giving
from two percent of GDP,
											up just one step to three percent of GDP,
by investing in that growth,
											that would be an extra 150 billion dollars
a year in contributions,
											and if that money
could go disproportionately
											to health and human services charities,
											because those were the ones we encouraged
to invest in their growth,
											that would represent a tripling
of contributions to that sector.
											Now we&#39;re talking scale.
											Now we&#39;re talking the potential
for real change.

Too many nonprofits, he says, are rewarded for how little they spend -- not for what they get done. Instead of equating frugality with morality, he asks us to start rewarding charities for their big goals and big accomplishments (even if that comes with big expenses). In this bold talk, he says: Let's change the way we think about changing the world.","event":"TED2013","language":"en","name":"Dan Pallotta: The way we think about charity is dead wrong","slug":"dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong","speakers":[{"id":"1476","slug":"dan_pallotta","is_published":true,"firstname":"Dan","lastname":"Pallotta","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"Author, speaker, reformer","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/53009f673f2dbfc38ca56d27e1ba791209f324cd_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"He liberates charity from its Puritan constraints and cogently attaches it to entrepreneurship.","whotheyare":"We dream boldly in the dimension of our doing, but set the bar no higher than stability in our emotional lives.

Yet there is no greater injustice than the double standard that exists between the for-profit and nonprofit sectors. One gets to feast on marketing, risk-taking, capital and financial incentive, the other is sentenced to begging,&rdquo; Dan Pallotta says in discussing his book <a href=\"http://www.charitycasebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Charity Case</em></a>. This economic starvation of our nonprofits is why he believes we are not moving the needle on great social problems. &ldquo;My goal &hellip; is to fundamentally transform the way the public thinks about charity within 10 years.&rdquo;</p>   <p>Pallotta is best known for creating the multi-day charitable event industry, and a new generation of philanthropists with the AIDS Rides and Breast Cancer 3-Day events, which raised $582 million in nine years.

attaches it to entrepreneurship.","whotheyare":"We dream boldly in the dimension of our doing, but set the bar no higher than stability in our emotional lives. It’s time to dream in multiple dimensions at the same time, says AIDSRide Founder Dan Pallotta. He aims to transform the way society thinks about giving, and being.","whylisten":"<p>&quot;The nonprofit sector is critical to our dream of changing the world. Yet there is no greater injustice than the double standard that exists between the for-profit and nonprofit sectors. One gets to feast on marketing, risk-taking, capital and financial incentive, the other is sentenced to begging,&rdquo; Dan Pallotta says in discussing his book <a href=\"http://www.charitycasebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Charity Case</em></a>. This economic starvation of our nonprofits is why he believes we are not moving the needle on great social problems. &ldquo;My goal &hellip; is to fundamentally transform the way the public thinks about charity within 10 years.&rdquo;</p>   <p>Pallotta is best known for creating the multi-day charitable event industry, and a new generation of philanthropists with the AIDS Rides and Breast Cancer 3-Day events, which raised $582 million in nine years. He is president of <a href=\"http://www.advertisingforhumanity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Advertising for Humanity</a>,&nbsp;which helps foundations and philanthropists transform the growth potential of their favorite grantees.
