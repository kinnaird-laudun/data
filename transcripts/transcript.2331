											Chris Anderson: Hello.
Welcome to this TED Dialogues.
											It&#39;s the first of a series
that&#39;s going to be done
											in response to the current
political upheaval.
											I don&#39;t know about you;
											I&#39;ve become quite concerned about
the growing divisiveness in this country
											and in the world.
											No one&#39;s listening to each other. Right?
											They aren&#39;t.
											I mean, it feels like we need
a different kind of conversation,
											one that&#39;s based on — I don&#39;t know,
on reason, listening, on understanding,
											on a broader context.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That&#39;s at least what we&#39;re going to try
in these TED Dialogues,
											starting today.
											And we couldn&#39;t have anyone with us
											who I&#39;d be more excited to kick this off.
											This is a mind right here that thinks
pretty much like no one else
											on the planet, I would hasten to say.
											I&#39;m serious.

											(Yuval Noah Harari laughs)
											I&#39;m serious.
											He synthesizes history
with underlying ideas
											in a way that kind of takes
your breath away.

this book, &quot;Sapiens.&quot;

											(Applause)
											I mean, I could not put it down.
											The way that he tells the story of mankind
											through big ideas that really make you
think differently —
											it&#39;s kind of amazing.
											And here&#39;s the follow-up,
											which I think is being published
in the US next week.

											CA: &quot;Homo Deus.&quot;
											Now, this is the history
of the next hundred years.
											I&#39;ve had a chance to read it.
											It&#39;s extremely dramatic,
											and I daresay, for some people,
quite alarming.
											It&#39;s a must-read.
											And honestly, we couldn&#39;t have
someone better to help
											make sense of what on Earth
is happening in the world right now.
											So a warm welcome, please,
to Yuval Noah Harari.

asking questions of Yuval,

											Yuval, if you&#39;re going
to make the argument
											that we need to get past nationalism
because of the coming technological ...
											danger, in a way,
											presented by so much of what&#39;s happening
											we&#39;ve got to have
a global conversation about this.
											Trouble is, it&#39;s hard to get people
really believing that, I don&#39;t know,
											AI really is an imminent
threat, and so forth.
											The things that people,
some people at least,
											care about much more immediately, perhaps,
											is climate change,
											perhaps other issues like refugees,
nuclear weapons, and so forth.
											Would you argue that where
we are right now
											that somehow those issues
need to be dialed up?
											You&#39;ve talked about climate change,
											but Trump has said
he doesn&#39;t believe in that.
											So in a way, your most powerful argument,
											you can&#39;t actually use to make this case.

											YNH: Yeah, I think with climate change,
											at first sight, it&#39;s quite surprising
											that there is a very close correlation
											between nationalism and climate change.
											I mean, almost always, the people
who deny climate change are nationalists.
											And at first sight, you think: Why?
											What&#39;s the connection?
											Why don&#39;t you have socialists
denying climate change?
											But then, when you think
about it, it&#39;s obvious —
											because nationalism has no solution
to climate change.
											If you want to be a nationalist
in the 21st century,
											you have to deny the problem.
											If you accept the reality of the problem,
then you must accept that, yes,
											there is still room in the world
for patriotism,
											there is still room in the world
for having special loyalties
											and obligations towards your own people,
towards your own country.
											I don&#39;t think anybody is really
thinking of abolishing that.

											But in order to confront climate change,
											we need additional loyalties
and commitments
											to a level beyond the nation.
											And that should not be impossible,
											because people can have
several layers of loyalty.
											You can be loyal to your family
											and to your community
											and to your nation,
											so why can&#39;t you also be loyal
to humankind as a whole?
											Of course, there are occasions
when it becomes difficult,
											what to put first,

											YNH: So far I haven&#39;t heard a very
good idea about what to do about it,

remain on the national level,

											I mean, one idea that we hear
quite a lot about now

it&#39;s not clear what &quot;universal&quot; is

education is a basic human need,

of basic income or not?

lose their ability to be employed,

											YNH: Well the good news, with regard
to the dangers of nationalism,
											we are in a much better position
than a century ago.
											A century ago, 1917,
											Europeans were killing
each other by the millions.
											In 2016, with Brexit,
as far as I remember,
											a single person lost their life,
an MP who was murdered by some extremist.
											Just a single person.
											I mean, if Brexit was about
British independence,
											this is the most peaceful
war of independence in human history.

will now choose to leave the UK
											after Brexit.

											So in the 18th century,
											if Scotland wanted — and the Scots
wanted several times —
											to break out of the control of London,
											the reaction of the government
in London was to send an army up north
											to burn down Edinburgh
and massacre the highland tribes.
											My guess is that if, in 2018,
the Scots vote for independence,
											the London government
will not send an army up north
											to burn down Edinburgh.
											Very few people are now willing
to kill or be killed
											for Scottish or for British independence.
											So for all the talk
of the rise of nationalism
											and going back to the 1930s,
											to the 19th century, in the West at least,
											the power of national sentiments
today is far, far smaller

											So you seem to be a fan

of political institutions,
											it&#39;s a vast sea of red with little bits

											The main reason we need it
											is because many of these issues
are lose-lose situations.
											When you have
a win-win situation like trade,
											both sides can benefit
from a trade agreement,
											then this is something you can work out.
											Without some kind of global government,
											national governments each
have an interest in doing it.

											Most likely it wouldn&#39;t.
											We don&#39;t have workable democratic models
											for a global government.
											So maybe it would look more
like ancient China

											because identity is always based
on fictional stories
											that sooner or later collide with reality.
											Almost all identities,
											I mean, beyond the level
of the basic community
											of a few dozen people,
											are based on a fictional story.
											They are not the truth.
											They are not the reality.
											It&#39;s just a story that people invent
and tell one another
											and start believing.
											And therefore all identities
are extremely unstable.
											They are not a biological reality.
											Sometimes nationalists, for example,
											think that the nation
is a biological entity.
											It&#39;s made of the combination
of soil and blood,
											creates the nation.
											But this is just a fictional story.

											Previously, if you look at the trajectory

agricultural workers,

											YNH: Well, I certainly think that the most
interesting question today in science
											is the question
of consciousness and the mind.
											We are getting better and better
in understanding the brain
											and intelligence,
											but we are not getting much better
											in understanding the mind
and consciousness.
											People often confuse intelligence
and consciousness,
											especially in places like Silicon Valley,
											which is understandable,
because in humans, they go together.
											I mean, intelligence basically
is the ability to solve problems.
											Consciousness is the ability
to feel things,
											to feel joy and sadness
and boredom and pain and so forth.
											In Homo sapiens and all other mammals
as well — it&#39;s not unique to humans —
											in all mammals and birds
and some other animals,
											intelligence and consciousness
go together.
											We often solve problems by feeling things.
											So we tend to confuse them.

some cosmic role for consciousness,
											it&#39;s not unique to Homo sapiens.
											Cows are conscious, pigs are conscious,
											chimpanzees are conscious,
chickens are conscious,
											so if we go that way, first of all,
we need to broaden our horizons
											and remember very clearly we are not

to find our role in the universe.

is to liberate ourselves from suffering.

											It&#39;s just very difficult for human beings

that we have created —

											For me the best ...
											There are several tests
											to tell the difference
between fiction and reality.
											The simplest one, the best one
that I can say in short,
											is the test of suffering.
											If it can suffer, it&#39;s real.
											If it can&#39;t suffer, it&#39;s not real.
											A nation cannot suffer.
											That&#39;s very, very clear.
											Even if a nation loses a war,
											we say, &quot;Germany suffered a defeat
in the First World War,&quot;
											it&#39;s a metaphor.
											Germany cannot suffer.
Germany has no mind.
											Germany has no consciousness.
											Germans can suffer, yes,
but Germany cannot.
											Similarly, when a bank goes bust,
											the bank cannot suffer.
											When the dollar loses its value,
the dollar doesn&#39;t suffer.
											People can suffer. Animals can suffer.
											This is real.
											So I would start, if you
really want to see reality,
											I would go through the door of suffering.
											If you can really understand
what suffering is,
											this will give you also the key
											to understand what reality is.

											&quot;How do we get people, governments,
to relinquish power?
											Is that — is that —
actually, the text is so big
											I can&#39;t read the full question.
											But is that a necessity?
											Is it going to take war to get there?
											Sorry Phil — I mangled your question,
but I blame the text right here.

											YNH: One option
that some people talk about
											is that only a catastrophe
can shake humankind
											and open the path to a real system
of global governance,
											and they say that we can&#39;t do it
before the catastrophe,
											but we need to start
laying the foundations
											so that when the disaster strikes,
											we can react quickly.
											But people will just not have
the motivation to do such a thing
											before the disaster strikes.
											Another thing that I would emphasize
											is that anybody who is really
interested in global governance
											should always make it very, very clear
											that it doesn&#39;t replace or abolish
local identities and communities,
											that it should come both as —
											It should be part of a single package.

											CA: I want to hear more on this,
											because the very words &quot;global governance&quot;
											are almost the epitome of evil
in the mindset of a lot of people
											on the alt-right right now.
											It just seems scary, remote, distant,
and it has let them down,
											and so globalists,
global governance — no, go away!
											And many view the election
as the ultimate poke in the eye
											to anyone who believes in that.
											So how do we change the narrative
											so that it doesn&#39;t seem
so scary and remote?
											Build more on this idea
of it being compatible
											with local identity, local communities.

											YNH: Well, I think again we should start
											really with the biological realities
											of Homo sapiens.
											And biology tells us two things
about Homo sapiens
											which are very relevant to this issue:
											first of all, that we are
completely dependent
											on the ecological system around us,
											and that today we are talking
about a global system.
											You cannot escape that.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And at the same time, biology tells us
about Homo sapiens
											that we are social animals,
											but that we are social
on a very, very local level.
											It&#39;s just a simple fact of humanity
											that we cannot have intimate familiarity
											with more than about 150 individuals.
											The size of the natural group,
											the natural community of Homo sapiens,
											is not more than 150 individuals,
											and everything beyond that is really
based on all kinds of imaginary stories
											and large-scale institutions,
											and I think that we can find a way,
											again, based on a biological
understanding of our species,
											to weave the two together
											and to understand that today
in the 21st century,
											we need both the global level
and the local community.

									<p>
											And I would go even further than that
											and say that it starts
with the body itself.
											The feelings that people today have
of alienation and loneliness
											and not finding their place in the world,
											I would think that the chief problem
is not global capitalism.
											The chief problem is that over
the last hundred years,
											people have been becoming disembodied,
											have been distancing themselves
from their body.
											As a hunter-gatherer or even as a peasant,
											to survive, you need to be
constantly in touch
											with your body and with your senses,
											every moment.
											If you go to the forest
to look for mushrooms
											and you don&#39;t pay attention
to what you hear,
											to what you smell, to what you taste,
											you&#39;re dead.
											So you must be very connected.

									<p>
											In the last hundred years,
people are losing their ability
											to be in touch with their body
and their senses,
											to hear, to smell, to feel.
											More and more attention goes to screens,
											to what is happening elsewhere,
											some other time.
											This, I think, is the deep reason
											for the feelings of alienation
and loneliness and so forth,
											and therefore part of the solution
											is not to bring back
some mass nationalism,
											but also reconnect with our own bodies,
											and if you are back
in touch with your body,
											you will feel much more at home
in the world also.

											Ama Adi-Dako: Hello. I&#39;m from Ghana,
West Africa, and my question is:
											I&#39;m wondering how do you present
and justify the idea of global governance
											to countries that have been
historically disenfranchised
											by the effects of globalization,
											and also, if we&#39;re talking about
global governance,
											it sounds to me like it will definitely
come from a very Westernized idea
											of what the &quot;global&quot;
is supposed to look like.
											So how do we present and justify
that idea of global
											versus wholly nationalist
											to people in countries like Ghana
and Nigeria and Togo
											and other countries like that?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											YNH: I would start by saying
that history is extremely unfair,
											and that we should realize that.
											Many of the countries that suffered most
											from the last 200 years of globalization
											and imperialism and industrialization
											are exactly the countries
which are also most likely to suffer most
											from the next wave.
											And we should be very,
very clear about that.
											If we don&#39;t have a global governance,
											and if we suffer from climate change,
											from technological disruptions,
											the worst suffering will not be in the US.
											The worst suffering will be in Ghana,
will be in Sudan, will be in Syria,
											will be in Bangladesh,
will be in those places.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I think those countries
have an even greater incentive
											to do something about
the next wave of disruption,
											whether it&#39;s ecological
or whether it&#39;s technological.
											Again, if you think about
technological disruption,
											so if AI and 3D printers and robots
will take the jobs
											from billions of people,
											I worry far less about the Swedes
											than about the people in Ghana
or in Bangladesh.
											And therefore,
because history is so unfair
											and the results of a calamity
											will not be shared equally
between everybody,
											as usual, the rich
will be able to get away
											from the worst consequences
of climate change
											in a way that the poor
will not be able to.

											CA: And here&#39;s a great question
from Cameron Taylor on Facebook:
											&quot;At the end of &#39;Sapiens,&#39;&quot;

to want to know the truth,

											Mostly what we want is to change reality,
											to fit it to our own desires,
to our own wishes,
											and I think we should first
want to understand it.
											If you look at the long-term
trajectory of history,
											what you see is that
for thousands of years
											we humans have been gaining
control of the world outside us
											and trying to shape it
to fit our own desires.
											And we&#39;ve gained control
of the other animals,
											of the rivers, of the forests,

is we turn our gaze inwards,

											Let&#39;s now try to gain control
of the world inside us.
											This is the really big project

											to try and gain control
of the world inside us,
											to learn how to engineer and produce
bodies and brains and minds.
											These are likely to be the main
products of the 21st century economy.
											When people think about the future,
very often they think in terms,

											If you look at the 20th century,

of the Industrial Revolution,
											the trains and electricity and all that
											could be used to create
a communist dictatorship
											or a fascist regime
or a liberal democracy.
											The trains did not tell you
what to do with them.
											Similarly, now, artificial intelligence
and bioengineering and all of that —
											they don&#39;t predetermine a single outcome.
											Humanity can rise up to the challenge,
											and the best example we have
											of humanity rising up
to the challenge of a new technology
											is nuclear weapons.
											In the late 1940s, &#39;50s,
											many people were convinced
											that sooner or later the Cold War
will end in a nuclear catastrophe,
											destroying human civilization.
											And this did not happen.
											In fact, nuclear weapons prompted

											And many countries basically took out war
											from their political toolkit.
											They no longer tried to pursue
their interests with warfare.
											Not all countries have done so,
but many countries have.
											And this is maybe
the most important reason
											why international violence
declined dramatically since 1945,
											and today, as I said,
more people commit suicide
											than are killed in war.
											So this, I think, gives us a good example
											that even the most frightening technology,
											humans can rise up to the challenge
											and actually some good can come out of it.
											The problem is, we have very little
margin for error.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events.
