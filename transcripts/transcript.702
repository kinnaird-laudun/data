											In October 2010,
											the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99.
											Icons like Batman,
											Superman, Wonder Woman and their colleagues
											will be teaming up with icons Jabbar, Noora,
											Jami and their colleagues.
											It&#39;s a story of intercultural intersections,
											and what better group
											to have this conversation
											than those that grew out of fighting fascism
											in their respective histories and geographies?
											As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s,
											an unlikely reaction came out of North America.
											As Christian iconography got changed,
											and swastikas were created out of crucifixes,
											Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men
											in the United States and Canada,
											also going back to the Bible.

											Consider this:
											like the prophets, all the superheroes
											are missing parents.
											Superman&#39;s parents die on Krypton
											before the age of one.
											Bruce Wayne, who becomes Batman,
											loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.
											Spiderman is raised
											by his aunt and uncle.
											And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message
											from God through Gabriel,
											get their message from above.
											Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan
											when the spider descends from above
											and gives him his message through a bite.
											Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom
											when a big bat flies over his head,
											and he sees it as an omen to become Batman.
											Superman is not only sent to Earth
											from the heavens, or Krypton,
											but he&#39;s sent in a pod, much like Moses was on the Nile.
											(Laughter)
											And you hear the voice of his father, Jor-El,
											saying to Earth, &quot;I have sent to you my only son.&quot;

											These are clearly biblical archetypes,
											and the thinking behind that was to create
											positive, globally-resonating storylines
											that could be tied to the same things
											that other people were pulling mean messages out of
											because then the person that&#39;s using religion for the wrong purpose
											just becomes a bad man with a bad message.
											And it&#39;s only by linking positive things
											that the negative can be delinked.
											This is the kind of thinking that went into
											creating The 99.
											The 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran,
											things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom
											and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about.
											It doesn&#39;t matter what your religion is;
											even if you&#39;re an atheist, you don&#39;t raise your kid telling him, you know,
											&quot;Make sure you lie three times a day.&quot;
											Those are basic human values.

											And so the backstory of The 99
											takes place in 1258,
											which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.
											All the books from Bait al-Hikma library,
											the most famous library in its day, were thrown in the Tigris River,
											and the Tigris changes color with ink.
											It&#39;s a story passed on generation after generation.
											I rewrote that story,
											and in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen —
											and here&#39;s a side note:
											if you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well.
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											So the librarians find out
											and they get together a special solution, a chemical solution called King&#39;s Water,
											that when mixed with 99 stones
											would be able to save all that culture and history in the books.
											But the Mongols get there first.
											The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River.
											Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks,
											they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom
											that we all think is lost to civilization.

											Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads
											of 33 stones each
											through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they&#39;re safe for 200 years.
											But in 1492, two important things happen.
											The first is the fall of Granada,
											the last Muslim enclave in Europe.
											The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost.
											(Laughter)
											So 33 of the stones are smuggled
											onto the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria
											and are spread in the New World.
											Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.
											And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

											And now it&#39;s 2010, and there are 99 heroes
											from 99 different countries.
											Now it&#39;s very easy to assume
											that those books, because they were from a library called Bait al-Hikma, were Muslim books,
											but that&#39;s not the case because the caliph that built that library,
											his name was al-Ma&#39;mun — he was Harun al-Rashid&#39;s son.
											He had told his advisers, &quot;Get me all the scholars
											to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic,
											and I will pay them its weight in gold.&quot;
											After a while, his advisers complained.
											They said, &quot;Your Highness, the scholars are cheating.
											They&#39;re writing in big handwriting to take more gold.&quot;
											To which he said, &quot;Let them be, because what they&#39;re giving us
											is worth a lot more than what we&#39;re paying them.&quot;
											So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge,
											is not new to my neck of the desert.

											The concept centers on something called the Noor stones.
											Noor is Arabic for light.
											So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game:
											Number one, you don&#39;t choose the stone; the stone chooses you.
											There&#39;s a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay.
											Number two, all of The 99,
											when they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it;
											they use it for self-interest.
											And there&#39;s a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone,
											you get taken advantage of
											by people who will exploit your powers, okay.
											Number three, the 99 stones all have within them
											a mechanism that self-updates.

											Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world.
											Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.
											Some believe that means that the original interpretation
											from a couple thousand years ago is what&#39;s relevant today.
											I don&#39;t belong there.
											Then there&#39;s a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document,
											and I captured that idea within these stones that self-update.
											Now the main bad guy, Rughal,
											does not want these stones to update,
											so he&#39;s trying to get them to stop updating.
											He can&#39;t use the stones, but he can stop them.
											And by stopping them, he has more of a fascist agenda,
											where he gets some of The 99 to work for him —
											they&#39;re all wearing cookie-cutter, same color uniforms
											They&#39;re not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are.
											And he controls them from the top down —
											whereas when they work for the other side, eventually,
											when they find out this is the wrong person, they&#39;ve been manipulated,
											they actually, each one has a different, colorful
											kind of dress.

											And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this.
											So The 99 work in teams of three.
											Why three? A couple of reasons.
											Number one, we have a thing within Islam that you don&#39;t leave a boy and a girl alone together,
											because the third person is temptation or the devil, right?
											I think that&#39;s there in all cultures, right?
											But this is not about religion, it&#39;s not about proselytizing.
											There&#39;s this very strong social message
											that needs to get to kind of
											the deepest crevices of intolerance,
											and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.
											And so this is the way I dealt with it.
											They work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy,
											three boys, three girls, no problem.
											And the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about
											the importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I&#39;m covered.
											Well ...
											I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope
											to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East,
											so you — (Laughter)
											you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story.

											So here&#39;s some of the characters that we have.
											Mujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she&#39;s able to answer any question.
											She&#39;s the Trivial Pursuit queen, if you want,
											but when she first gets her power,
											she starts going on game shows and making money.
											We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power.
											Now, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.
											So the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang;
											there&#39;s the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong,
											and there&#39;s also the kind, the generous.
											I&#39;m like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong?
											I&#39;m like, you know what, I&#39;ve met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...
											(Laughter)
											We have Jami from Hungary, who first starts making weapons:
											He&#39;s the technology wiz.
											Musawwira from Ghana,
											Hadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire.
											And this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen.
											Al-Batina is the hidden.
											So Al-Batina is hidden, but she&#39;s a superhero.
											I came home to my wife and I said, &quot;I created a character after you.&quot;
											My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.
											And she said, &quot;Show me.&quot; So I showed this.
											She said, &quot;That&#39;s not me.&quot;

											Now I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference,

											Didn&#39;t have a product, but had energy.
											And I found somebody from The New York Times,
											and I cornered him, and I pitched him.
											And I think I scared him — (Laughter)
											because he basically promised me —
											we had no product — but he said, &quot;We&#39;ll give you a paragraph in the arts section

											&quot;So when&#39;s the article coming out?&quot;

											And that led to all kinds of things,
											from being in curricula in universities and schools to —

											Now, one of the things that I refer to

											is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University,
											where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior,
											and I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times
											and one from New York magazine.
											And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] — everything was gone except the facts.
											And the first one was about a group called The Party of God,
											who wanted to ban Valentine&#39;s Day. Red was made illegal.
											Any boys and girls caught flirting
											would get married off immediately, okay.
											The second one was about a woman complaining

											The first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate.
											The second one, they were actually split
											between Saudi and Afghanistan.
											What blew their mind was the first one took place in India,
											it was the party of a Hindu God.
											The second one took place in upstate New York.
											It was an Orthodox Jewish community.
											But what breaks my heart and what&#39;s alarming
											is that in those two interviews,
											the people around, who were interviewed as well,
											refer to that behavior as Talibanization.
											In other words, good Hindus and good Jews don&#39;t act this way.
											This is Islam&#39;s influence on Hinduism and Judaism.
											But what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it&#39;s us —

											I said, &quot;Go away. I&#39;m working. I&#39;m busy.&quot;
											And what Rayan did then
											is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half,
											and he looked at me and he said, &quot;Baba,
											I want you to come with me to my office in my house.
											I have work to do.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											Rayan reframed the situation
											and brought himself down to my level.

											And with The 99, that is what we aim to do.
											You know, I think that there&#39;s a big parallel
											between bending the crucifix out of shape
											and creating swastikas.
											And when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles
											who think it&#39;s cute to have a little child
											holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them
											to protest something,
											the hope is by linking enough positive things
											to the Koran,
											that one day we can move this child
											from being proud in the way they&#39;re proud there,
											to that.
											And I think —
											I think The 99
											can and will achieve its mission.

											As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day
											and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.
											And people came up and picked up
											the culturally resonant image of the falafel,
											ate it and, you know, talked and left.
											And no two people could disagree about what the word free was
											and what the word falafel was, behind us, &quot;free falafel.&quot; You know.
											(Laughter)
											Or so we thought,
											until a woman came rushing across the campus
											and dropped her bag on the floor, pointed up to the sign and said,
											&quot;Who&#39;s falafel?&quot;
											(Laughter)
											True story.
											(Laughter)
											She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting.

											Just today, D.C. Comics announced
											the cover of our upcoming crossover.
											On that cover you see Batman, Superman
											and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman
											with our Saudi member of The 99,
											our Emirati member and our Libyan member.
											On April 26, 2010,
											President Barack Obama said that
											of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech —
											in which he reached out to the Muslim world —
											the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out
											to the Justice League of America.
											We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols,
											like the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage,
											and where religion can be twisted
											and purposefully made where it&#39;s not supposed to be by others.
											In a world like that,
											they&#39;ll always be a job for Superman and The 99.
