<title>Kimberlé Crenshaw: The urgency of intersectionality | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Now more than ever, it&#39;s important to look boldly at the reality of race and gender bias -- and understand how the two can combine to create even more harm. Kimberlé Crenshaw uses the term &quot;intersectionality&quot; to describe this phenomenon; as she says, if you&#39;re standing in the path of multiple forms of exclusion, you&#39;re likely to get hit by both. In this moving talk, she calls on us to bear witness to this reality and speak up for victims of prejudice." />

<meta content='Now more than ever, it&#x0027;s important to look boldly at the reality of race and gender bias — and understand how the two can combine to create even more harm. Kimberlé Crenshaw uses the term "intersectionality" to describe this phenomenon; as she says, if you&#x0027;re standing in the path of multiple forms of exclusion, you&#x0027;re likely to get hit by both. In this moving talk, she calls on us to bear witness to this reality and speak up for victims of prejudice.' itemprop='description'>

											I&#39;ve done it with psychologists.
I&#39;ve done it with sociologists.
											I&#39;ve done it even with
progressive members of Congress.

											Now, it is surprising, isn&#39;t it,
that this would be the case.
											I mean, there are two issues
involved here.
											There&#39;s police violence
against African-Americans,
											and there&#39;s violence against women,
											two issues that have been
talked about a lot lately.
											But when we think about
who is implicated by these problems,
											when we think about
who is victimized by these problems,
											the names of these black women
never come to mind.

											Now, communications experts tell us
											that when facts do not fit
with the available frames,

incorporating new facts

about a problem.
											These women&#39;s names
have slipped through our consciousness
											because there are no frames
for us to see them,
											no frames for us to remember them,
											no frames for us to hold them.
											As a consequence,
											reporters don&#39;t lead with them,
											policymakers don&#39;t think about them,

or demanded that they speak to them.

											Well, the simple answer is that this is
a trickle-down approach to social justice,

											Without frames that allow us to see
											how social problems impact
all the members of a targeted group,

											Many years ago, I began to use
the term &quot;intersectionality&quot;
											to deal with the fact
that many of our social justice problems
											like racism and sexism
											are often overlapping,
											creating multiple levels
of social injustice.

									<p>
											Now, the experience
that gave rise to intersectionality
											was my chance encounter
with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.
											Emma DeGraffenreid
was an African-American woman,
											a working wife and a mother.
											I actually read about Emma&#39;s story
from the pages of a legal opinion
											written by a judge
who had dismissed Emma&#39;s claim
											of race and gender discrimination
											against a local car manufacturing plant.
											Emma, like so many African-American women,
											sought better employment
for her family and for others.
											She wanted to create a better life
for her children and for her family.
											But she applied for a job,
											and she was not hired,
											and she believed that she was not hired
because she was a black woman.

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, the judge in question
dismissed Emma&#39;s suit,
											and the argument
for dismissing the suit was
											that the employer
did hire African-Americans
											and the employer hired women.
											The real problem, though, that the judge
was not willing to acknowledge
											was what Emma was actually trying to say,
											that the African-Americans
that were hired,
											usually for industrial jobs,
maintenance jobs, were all men.
											And the women that were hired,
											usually for secretarial
or front-office work,
											were all white.
											Only if the court was able to see
how these policies came together
											would he be able to see
the double discrimination
											that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.
											But the court refused to allow Emma
to put two causes of action together
											to tell her story
											because he believed that,
by allowing her to do that,
											she would be able
to have preferential treatment.
											She would have an advantage
by having two swings at the bat,
											when African-American men and white women
only had one swing at the bat.
											But of course, neither
African-American men or white women
											needed to combine a race
and gender discrimination claim
											to tell the story of the discrimination
they were experiencing.
											Why wasn&#39;t the real unfairness
											law&#39;s refusal to protect
African-American women
											simply because their experiences
weren&#39;t exactly the same
											as white women and African-American men?
											Rather than broadening the frame
to include African-American women,
											the court simply tossed their case
completely out of court.

									<p>
											Now, as a student
of antidiscrimination law,
											as a feminist,
											as an antiracist,
											I was struck by this case.
											It felt to me like injustice squared.
											So first of all,
											black women weren&#39;t allowed
to work at the plant.
											Second of all, the court
doubled down on this exclusion
											by making it legally inconsequential.
											And to boot, there was
no name for this problem.
											And we all know that,
where there&#39;s no name for a problem,
											you can&#39;t see a problem,
											and when you can&#39;t see a problem,
you pretty much can&#39;t solve it.

									<p>
											Many years later, I had come to recognize
											that the problem that Emma was facing
was a framing problem.
											The frame that the court was using
											to see gender discrimination
or to see race discrimination
											was partial, and it was distorting.
											For me, the challenge that I faced was
											trying to figure out whether
there was an alternative narrative,
											a prism that would allow us
to see Emma&#39;s dilemma,
											a prism that would allow us
to rescue her from the cracks in the law,
											that would allow judges to see her story.

									<p>
											So it occurred to me,
											maybe a simple analogy to an intersection
											might allow judges
to better see Emma&#39;s dilemma.
											So if we think about this intersection,
the roads to the intersection would be
											the way that the workforce
was structured by race and by gender.
											And then the traffic in those roads
would be the hiring policies
											and the other practices
that ran through those roads.
											Now, because Emma
was both black and female,
											she was positioned precisely
where those roads overlapped,
											experiencing the simultaneous impact
											of the company&#39;s gender and race traffic.
											The law — the law is
like that ambulance that shows up
											and is ready to treat Emma
only if it can be shown
											that she was harmed
on the race road or on the gender road
											but not where those roads intersected.

											I would go on to learn
that African-American women,
											like other women of color,
											like other socially marginalized people
all over the world,
											were facing all kinds
of dilemmas and challenges
											as a consequence of intersectionality,
											intersections of race and gender,
											of heterosexism, transphobia,
xenophobia, ableism,
											all of these social dynamics come together
											and create challenges
that are sometimes quite unique.

											Police violence against black women
											is very real.
											The level of violence
that black women face
											is such that it&#39;s not surprising
											that some of them do not survive
their encounters with police.
											Black girls as young as seven,

when they&#39;ve called for help.
											They&#39;ve been killed when they were alone,

when they were with others.

in front of the White House
											with an infant strapped
in the backseat of the car.

Her work has been foundational in two fields of study that have come to be known by terms that she coined: critical race theory and intersectionality.</p><p>Crenshaw&rsquo;s articles have appeared in the <em>Harvard Law Review</em>, <em>National Black Law Journal</em>, <em>Stanford Law Review</em> and <em>Southern California Law Review</em>. She is the founding coordinator of the Critical Race Theory Workshop, and the co-editor of the volume,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/GNsc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Critical Race Theory: Key Documents That Shaped the Movement</em></a>. She has lectured widely on race matters, addressing audiences across the country as well as in Europe, India, Africa and South America. A specialist on race and gender equality, she has facilitated workshops for human rights activists in Brazil and in India, and for constitutional court judges in South Africa. Her groundbreaking work on intersectionality has traveled globally and was influential in the drafting of the equality clause in the South African Constitution.</p><p>Crenshaw authored the background paper on race and gender discrimination for the United Nation&#39;s World Conference on Racism, served as the rapporteur for the conference&#39;s expert group on gender and race discrimination, and coordinated NGO efforts to ensure the inclusion of gender in the WCAR Conference Declaration. She is a leading voice in calling for a gender-inclusive approach to racial justice interventions, having spearheaded the &quot;Why We Can&#39;t Wait&quot; campaign and co-authored&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/ONVPWP\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Black Girls Matter: Pushed Out, Overpoliced and Underprotected</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/a2rOT\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women</em></a>.</p><p>Crenshaw has worked extensively on a variety of issues pertaining to gender and race in the domestic arena including violence against women, structural racial inequality and affirmative action. She has served as a member of the National Science Foundation&#39;s committee to research violence against women and has consulted with leading foundations, social justice organizations and corporations to advance their race and gender equity initiatives.</p><p>In 1996, she co-founded the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.aapf.org/\" target=\"_blank\">African American Policy Forum</a>&nbsp;to house a variety of projects designed to deliver research-based strategies to better advance social inclusion. Among the Forum&#39;s projects are the Affirmative Action Research and Policy Consortium and the Multiracial Literacy and Leadership Initiative. In partnership with the Aspen Roundtable for Community Change, Crenshaw facilitated workshops on racial equity for hundreds of community leaders and organizations throughout the country. With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Crenshaw facilitates the Bellagio Project, an international network of scholars working in the field of social inclusion from five continents. She formerly served as Committee Chair for the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Promote Racial and Ethnic Equality, an initiative of the U.S. State Department.</p><p>Crenshaw has received the Fulbright Distinguished Chair for Latin America, the Alphonse Fletcher Fellowship and was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in 2009 and a Visiting Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy in 2010. Currently, Crenshaw is director of the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies &nbsp;at Columbia Law School, which she founded in 2011, as well as the Centennial Professor at the LSE Gender Institute 2015-2018. Crenshaw received her J.D. from Harvard, L.L.M. from University of Wisconsin and B.A. from Cornell University.</p>"},{"id":"3112","slug":"abby_dobson","is_published":true,"firstname":"Abby","lastname":"Dobson","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"Artist","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/6711d4bb8feaa0e072672c605498fdcf26681b2c_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"","whotheyare":"Passionate about using music as a tool for empathy cultivation, Abby Dobson creates music to inspire audiences to reflect on the world we live in and engage in action to promote transformative social change.

A sonic conceptualist artist, Dobson&#39;s sound is the alchemy of R&amp;B/Soul, jazz, classic pop, gospel and folk, forging a gem that erases musical boundaries. Dobson has performed at venues such as S.O.B&#39;s, Kennedy Center Millennium Stage, Apollo Theater, Blue Note Jazz Club, Queens Museum and &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot; Her debut album,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Beauty-Have-Waiting-Volumood/dp/B004B4J57A\" target=\"_blank\">Sleeping Beauty: You Are the One You Have Been Waiting On</a>,</em>&nbsp;was released in 2010 to glowing reviews. Featured on Talib Kweli&rsquo;s album <em>Gravitas</em> on <em>State of Grace</em>, Dobson was also nominated for a 2014 BET Hip Hop Award for Best Impact Song.</p><p>Dobson received a Juris Doctorate degree from Georgetown University Law Center and a Bachelor&#39;s degree from Williams College in Political Science and History. Her interests have been deeply impacted by intersectionality discourse and critical race theory. An artist and independent scholar, Dobson&#39;s interests focus on the intersection of race and gender in the imagination, creation and consumption of music. A sampling of recent presentations include: International James Baldwin Conference at American University of Paris (2016), Association for the Study of African American History and Life Conference (2013-2015); Anna Julia Cooper Project at Tulane University (2013); and National Women&#39;s Studies Association (NWSA) Conference (2013).</p><p>Passionate about using music as a tool for empathy cultivation, Dobson creates music to inspire audiences to reflect on the world we live in and engage in action to promote transformative social change.
