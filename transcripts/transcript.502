											Today I&#39;m going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.
											And the problem I&#39;m going to talk about
											is not the familiar one from philosophy,
											which is, &quot;How can we know
											whether other people have minds?&quot;
											That is, maybe you have a mind,
											and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.
											So that&#39;s a problem in philosophy,
											but for today&#39;s purposes I&#39;m going to assume
											that many people in this audience have a mind,
											and that I don&#39;t have to worry about this.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us
											as parents and teachers and spouses
											and novelists,
											which is, &quot;Why is it so hard
											to know what somebody else wants or believes?&quot;
											Or perhaps, more relevantly,
											&quot;Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I think novelists put this best.
											Like Philip Roth, who said,
											&quot;And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business
											of other people?
											So ill equipped are we all,
											to envision one another&#39;s interior workings
											and invisible aims.&quot;
											So as a teacher and as a spouse,
											this is, of course, a problem I confront every day.
											But as a scientist, I&#39;m interested in a different problem of other minds,
											and that is the one I&#39;m going to introduce to you today.
											And that problem is, &quot;How is it so easy
											to know other minds?&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So to start with an illustration,
											you need almost no information,
											one snapshot of a stranger,
											to guess what this woman is thinking,
											or what this man is.
											And put another way, the crux of the problem is
											the machine that we use for thinking about other minds,
											our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,
											that we share with all other animals, with monkeys
											and mice and even sea slugs.
											And yet, you put them together in a particular network,
											and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.
											Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did,
											&quot;I know you think you understand what you thought I said,
											but I&#39;m not sure you realize that what you heard
											is not what I meant.&quot;
											(Laughter)
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience
											is to stand with these ideas,
											one in each hand.
											And to try to understand how you can put together
											simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,
											and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.
											So I&#39;m going to tell you three things about this today.
											Obviously the whole project here is huge.
											And I&#39;m going to tell you just our first few steps
											about the discovery of a special brain region
											for thinking about other people&#39;s thoughts.
											Some observations on the slow development of this system
											as we learn how to do this difficult job.
											And then finally, to show that some of the differences
											between people, in how we judge others,
											can be explained by differences in this brain system.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that
											there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,
											whose job it is to think about other people&#39;s thoughts.
											This is a picture of it.
											It&#39;s called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.
											It&#39;s above and behind your right ear.
											And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,
											or when you read Romeo and Juliet
											or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.
											And you don&#39;t use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.
											So this brain region is called the Right TPJ.

											So the three-year-old does two things differently.
											First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich

											And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,
											where we would say he&#39;s taking that one because he thinks it&#39;s his,
											the three-year-old comes up with another explanation:
											He&#39;s not taking his own sandwich because he doesn&#39;t want it,
											because now it&#39;s dirty, on the ground.
											So that&#39;s why he&#39;s taking the other sandwich.
											Now of course, development doesn&#39;t end at five.
											And we can see the continuation of this process
											of learning to think about other people&#39;s thoughts
											by upping the ante
											and asking children now, not for an action prediction,
											but for a moral judgment.
											So first I&#39;m going to show you the three-year-old again.

											And now what we&#39;ve started to do in my lab
											is to put children into the brain scanner
											and ask what&#39;s going on in their brain
											as they develop this ability to think about other people&#39;s thoughts.
											So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,
											being used while children are thinking about other people.
											But it&#39;s not quite like the adult brain.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So whereas in the adults, as I told you,
											this brain region is almost completely specialized —
											it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people&#39;s thoughts —
											in children it&#39;s much less so,
											when they are age five to eight,
											the age range of the children I just showed you.
											And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,
											getting into early adolescence,
											they still don&#39;t have quite an adult-like brain region.
											And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood
											and even into adolescence,
											both the cognitive system,
											our mind&#39;s ability to think about other minds,
											and the brain system that supports it
											are continuing, slowly, to develop.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But of course, as you&#39;re probably aware,
											even in adulthood,
											people differ from one another in how good they are
											at thinking of other minds, how often they do it
											and how accurately.
											And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults
											in how they think about other people&#39;s thoughts
											be explained in terms of differences in this brain region?
											So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version
											of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.
											And I&#39;m going to give that to you now.

											containing a white powder, which is sugar.
											But the powder is labeled &quot;Deadly Poison,&quot;
											so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.
											And she puts it in her friend&#39;s coffee.
											And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.

											Now she thinks the powder is sugar.
											And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar
											and puts it in her friend&#39;s coffee,
											people say she deserves no blame at all.
											Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it&#39;s really sugar,

											Where Grace thought the powder was sugar,

											but actually the powder was poison.
											So even though when the powder was poison,
											the friend drank the coffee and died,

											So these are the judgments I showed you before, people&#39;s normal moral judgments.

											Chris Anderson: So, I have a question. When you start talking about using
											magnetic pulses to change people&#39;s moral judgments,

											CA: They really are calling?
											So then seriously,
											you must lie awake at night sometimes
											wondering where this work leads.
											I mean, you&#39;re clearly an incredible human being,

											not-torture chamber,

											RS: Yeah, we worry about this.
											So, there&#39;s a couple of things to say about TMS.
											One is that you can&#39;t be TMSed without knowing it.
											So it&#39;s not a surreptitious technology.
											It&#39;s quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.
											The changes I showed you are impressive to me
											because of what they tell us about the function of the brain,
											but they&#39;re small on the scale
											of the moral judgments that we actually make.

											We changed their ability to judge other people&#39;s actions.

											RS: That&#39;s one of the idealistic hopes.
											The whole research program here of studying
											the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.
											Until recently, what we knew about the brain
											were the things that any other animal&#39;s brain could do too,
											so we could study it in animal models.
											We knew how brains see, and how they control the body
											and how they hear and sense.
											And the whole project of understanding
											how brains do the uniquely human things —
											learn language and abstract concepts,
											and thinking about other people&#39;s thoughts — that&#39;s brand new.
											And we don&#39;t know yet what the implications will be
											of understanding it.

											CA: So I&#39;ve got one last question. There is this thing called
											the hard problem of consciousness,
											that puzzles a lot of people.
											The notion that you can understand
											why a brain works, perhaps.
											But why does anyone have to feel anything?
											Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things
											for us to operate?
											You&#39;re a brilliant young neuroscientist.
											I mean, what chances do you think there are
											that at some time in your career,
											someone, you or someone else,
											is going to come up with some paradigm shift
											in understanding what seems an impossible problem?
