											I&#39;m a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,
											I&#39;m actually interested in how the brain learns,
											and I&#39;m especially interested in a possibility of
											making our brains smarter, better and faster.

											This is in this context I&#39;m going to tell you
											about video games. When we say video games,
											most of you think about children.
											It&#39;s true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.
											But let&#39;s be frank.
											When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?
											Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,
											not eight years old, and in fact, if we look
											at the projected demographics of video game play,
											the video game players of tomorrow are
											older adults. (Laughter)

											So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.
											It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact
											on our everyday life. Consider these statistics
											released by Activision. After one month of release
											of the game &quot;Call Of Duty: Black Ops,&quot; it had been played
											for 68,000 years
											worldwide, right?
											Would any of you complain if this was the case
											about doing linear algebra?

											So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?
											Now I want to step back a bit.
											I know most of you have had the experience of coming back
											home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.
											(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get
											after your enemy zombie bad guys
											before they get to you, right?
											And I&#39;m almost sure most of you have thought,
											&quot;Oh, come on, can&#39;t you do something more intelligent
											than shooting at zombies?&quot;
											I&#39;d like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction
											in the context of what you would have thought
											if you had found your girl playing sudoku
											or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?
											Most parents would find that great.
											Well, I&#39;m not going to tell you that playing video games
											days in and days out is actually good for your health.
											It&#39;s not, and binging is never good.
											But I&#39;m going to argue that in reasonable doses,
											actually the very game I showed you at the beginning,
											those action-packed shooter games
											have quite powerful effects and positive effects
											on many different aspects of our behavior.

											There&#39;s not one week that goes without some major
											headlines in the media about whether video games are
											good or bad for you, right? You&#39;re all bombarded with that.
											I&#39;d like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside
											and get you to actually step into the lab.
											What we do in the lab is actually measure directly,
											in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact
											of video games on the brain.
											And so I&#39;m going to take a few examples from our work.

											One first saying that I&#39;m sure you all have heard
											is the fact that too much screen time
											makes your eyesight worse.
											That&#39;s a statement about vision.
											There may be vision scientists among you.
											We actually know how to test that statement.
											We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.
											Well, guess what? People that don&#39;t play a lot
											of action games, that don&#39;t actually spend a lot of time
											in front of screens, have normal, or what we call
											corrective-to-normal vision. That&#39;s okay.
											The issue is what happens with these guys that actually
											indulge into playing video games like five hours per week,
											10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.
											By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
											Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.
											It&#39;s better than those that don&#39;t play.
											And it&#39;s better in two different ways.
											The first way is that they&#39;re actually able to resolve
											small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means
											being able to read the fine print on a prescription
											rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it
											with just your eyesight.
											The other way that they are better is actually being able
											to resolve different levels of gray.
											Imagine you&#39;re driving in a fog. That makes a difference
											between seeing the car in front of you
											and avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.
											So we&#39;re actually leveraging that work to develop games
											for patients with low vision, and to have an impact
											on retraining their brain to see better.
											Clearly, when it comes to action video games,
											screen time doesn&#39;t make your eyesight worse.

											Another saying that I&#39;m sure you have all heard around:
											Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.
											Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.
											I&#39;m actually going to give you an example of how we do so.
											I&#39;m going to ask you to participate, so you&#39;re going to have
											to actually play the game with me. I&#39;m going to show you
											colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.
											Right? So this is the first example.
											[&quot;Chair&quot;]
											Orange, good. [&quot;Table&quot;] Green.
											[&quot;Board&quot;] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.
											[&quot;Horse&quot;] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.
											[&quot;Yellow&quot;] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.
											[&quot;Blue&quot;] DB: Yellow.
											Okay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)
											You&#39;re getting better, but it&#39;s hard. Why is it hard?
											Because I introduced a conflict between
											the word itself and its color.
											How good your attention is determines actually how fast
											you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here
											at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better
											than some of us that are older.
											What we can show is that when you do this kind of task
											with people that play a lot of action games,
											they actually resolve the conflict faster.
											So clearly playing those action games doesn&#39;t lead
											to attention problems.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Actually, those action video game players have
											many other advantages in terms of attention, and one
											aspect of attention which is also improved for the better
											is our ability to track objects around in the world.
											This is something we use all the time. When you&#39;re driving,
											you&#39;re tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.
											You&#39;re also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,
											and that&#39;s how you can actually be safe driving, right?

									<p>
											In the lab, we get people to come to the lab,
											sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them
											little tasks that I&#39;m going to get you to do again.
											You&#39;re going to see yellow happy faces
											and a few sad blue faces. These are children
											in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess
											during the winter. Most kids are happy. It&#39;s actually recess.
											But a few kids are sad and blue because they&#39;ve forgotten their coat.
											Everybody begins to move around, and your task
											is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning
											and who didn&#39;t. So I&#39;m just going to show you an example
											where there is only one sad kid. It&#39;s easy because you can
											actually track it with your eyes. You can track,
											you can track, and then when it stops, and there is
											a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?
											Was it yellow initially or blue?
											I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)
											I&#39;m now going to ask you to do the task, but now with
											a little more challenging task. There are going to be
											three of them that are blue. Don&#39;t move your eyes.
											Please don&#39;t move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated
											and expand, pull your attention. That&#39;s the only way
											you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you&#39;re doomed.
											Yellow or blue?
											Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.
											So your typical normal young adult
											can have a span of about three or four objects of attention.
											That&#39;s what we just did. Your action video game player
											has a span of about six to seven objects of attention,
											which is what is shown in this video here.
											That&#39;s for you guys, action video game players.
											A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)
											Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people
											that are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)

									<p>
											Good. So in the same way that we actually see
											the effects of video games on people&#39;s behavior,
											we can use brain imaging and look at the impact
											of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,
											but the main changes are actually to the brain networks
											that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex
											which is very well known to control the orientation of attention.
											The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls
											how we sustain attention, and another one
											is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate
											and regulate attention and resolve conflict.
											Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three
											of these networks are actually much more efficient
											in people that play action games.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding
											in the literature about technology and the brain.
											You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty
											of multitasking when you&#39;re driving
											and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.
											Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,
											you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly
											to the car braking in front of you, and so you&#39;re
											much more likely to get engaged into a car accident.
											Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.
											We obviously don&#39;t ask people to drive around and see
											how many car accidents they have. That would be a little
											costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer
											where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,
											how good they are at switching from one task to another.
											When we do that, we actually find that people
											that play a lot of action games are really, really good.
											They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now I&#39;d like you to remember that result, and put it
											in the context of another group of technology users,
											a group which is actually much revered by society,
											which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
											What is multimedia-tasking? It&#39;s the fact that most of us,
											most of our children, are engaged with listening to music
											at the same time as they&#39;re doing search on the web
											at the same time as they&#39;re chatting on Facebook with their friends.
											That&#39;s a multimedia-tasker.
											There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford
											and that we replicated that showed that
											those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers
											are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.
											When we measure them in the lab, they&#39;re really bad.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Right? So these kinds of results really
											makes two main points.
											The first one is that not all media are created equal.
											You can&#39;t compare the effect of multimedia-tasking
											and the effect of playing action games. They have
											totally different effects on different aspects of cognition,
											perception and attention.
											Even within video games, I&#39;m telling you right now
											about these action-packed video games.
											Different video games have a different effect on your brains.
											So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure
											what is the effect of each video game.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.
											I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that
											despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers
											have a lot of very good vision, etc.
											Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates
											that actually report engaging in a lot of high
											multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.
											So you show them their data, you show them they are bad
											and they&#39;re like, &quot;Not possible.&quot; You know, they have
											this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.
											That&#39;s another argument for why we need to step into the lab
											and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now in a sense, when we think about the effect
											of video games on the brain, it&#39;s very similar
											to the effect of wine on the health.
											There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some
											very poor uses of video games. But when consumed
											in reasonable doses, and at the right age,
											wine can be very good for health. There are actually
											specific molecules that have been identified
											in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.
											So it&#39;s the same way, like those action video games
											have a number of ingredients that are actually really
											powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,
											vision, etc., and so we need and we&#39;re working on
											understanding what are those active ingredients so that
											we can really then leverage them to deliver better games,
											either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now because we are interested in having an impact
											for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually
											not that interested in how those of you that choose
											to play video games for many hours on end perform.
											I&#39;m much more interested in taking any of you
											and showing that by forcing you to play an action game,
											I can actually change your vision for the better,
											whether you want to play that action game or not, right?
											That&#39;s the point of rehabilitation or education.
											Most of the kids don&#39;t go to school saying,
											&quot;Great, two hours of math!&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So that&#39;s really the crux of the research, and to do that,
											we need to go one more step.
											And one more step is to do training studies.
											So let me illustrate that step with
											a task which is called mental rotation.
											Mental rotation is a task where I&#39;m going to ask you,
											and again you&#39;re going to do the task,
											to look at this shape. Study it, it&#39;s a target shape,
											and I&#39;m going to present to you four different shapes.
											One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated
											version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:
											the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?
											Okay, I&#39;ll help you. Fourth one.
											One more. Get those brains working. Come on.
											That&#39;s our target shape.
											Third. Good! This is hard, right?
											Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because
											you really feel your brain cringing, right?
											It doesn&#39;t really feel like playing mindless action video games.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, what we do in these training studies is, people
											come to the lab, they do tasks like this one,
											we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.
											They don&#39;t play 10 hours of action games in a row.
											They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes
											several days over a period of two weeks.
											Then, once they are done with the training, they come back
											a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type
											of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague
											in Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,
											you know, subjects perform where they are expected
											to perform given their age. After two weeks of training
											on action video games, they actually perform better,
											and the improvement is still there five months after
											having done the training. That&#39;s really, really important.
											Why? Because I told you we want to use these games
											for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects
											that are going to be long-lasting.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering
											well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market
											a game that would be good for the attention
											of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,
											or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision
											of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, we&#39;re working on it, but here is a challenge.
											There are brain scientists like me that are beginning
											to understand what are the good ingredients in games
											to promote positive effects, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m going
											to call the broccoli side of the equation.
											There is an entertainment software industry
											which is extremely deft at coming up with
											appealing products that you can&#39;t resist.
											That&#39;s the chocolate side of the equation.
											The issue is we need to put the two together,
											and it&#39;s a little bit like with food.
											Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
											None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had
											that feeling, right, picking up an education game
											and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it&#39;s not really fun,
											it&#39;s not really engaging. So what we need
											is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate
											that is irresistible, that you really want to play,
											but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients
											that are extracted from the broccoli that you can&#39;t recognize
											but are still working on your brains. And we&#39;re working on it,
											but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,
											people that work in the entertainment software industry,
											and publishers, so these are not people that usually
											meet every day, but it&#39;s actually doable,
											and we are on the right track.
											I&#39;d like to leave you with that thought,
											and thank you for your attention. (Applause)
											(Applause)
