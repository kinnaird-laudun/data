<title>Eve Abrams: The human stories behind mass incarceration | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The United States locks up more people than any other country in the world, says documentarian Eve Abrams, and somewhere between one and four percent of those in prison are likely innocent. That&#39;s 87,000 brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers -- predominantly African American -- unnecessarily separated from their families, their lives and dreams put on hold. Using audio from her interviews with incarcerated people and their families, Abrams shares touching stories of those impacted by mass incarceration and calls on us all to take a stand and ensure that the justice system works for everyone." />

<meta content="The United States locks up more people than any other country in the world, says documentarian Eve Abrams, and somewhere between one and four percent of those in prison are likely innocent. That's 87,000 brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers — predominantly African American — unnecessarily separated from their families, their lives and dreams put on hold. Using audio from her interviews with incarcerated people and their families, Abrams shares touching stories of those impacted by mass incarceration and calls on us all to take a stand and ensure that the justice system works for everyone." itemprop='description'>

											EA: Sheila&#39;s son, McKinley,
is one of those innocent people.
											He served 17 years of a 30-year sentence
on a manslaughter charge.
											He had no previous convictions,
											there was no forensic
evidence in the case.
											He was convicted solely
on the basis of eyewitness testimony,
											and decades of research have shown
											that eyewitness testimony
isn&#39;t as reliable
											as we once believed it to be.
											Scientists say that memory isn&#39;t precise.
											It&#39;s less like playing back a video,
											and more like putting together a puzzle.
											Since 1989, when DNA testing
was first used to free innocent people,
											over 70 percent of overturned convictions
were based on eyewitness testimony.
											Last year,
											the district attorney whose office
prosecuted McKinley&#39;s case
											was convicted of unrelated
corruption charges.
											When this district attorney
of 30 years stepped down,
											the eyewitnesses
from McKinley&#39;s case came forward
											and said that they had been pressured
into testifying by the district attorneys,
											pressure which included
the threat of jail time.
											Despite this, McKinley is still in prison.

people are locked up
											range between one and four percent,
											which maybe doesn&#39;t sound like a lot,

to around 87,000 people:
											mothers, fathers, sons locked up,
											often for decades,

											EA: According to the Annie E.
Casey Foundation,
											the number of young people with a father
incarcerated rose 500 percent
											between 1980 and 2000.
											Over five million of today&#39;s children
will see a parent incarcerated
											at some point in their childhoods.
											But this number disproportionately
affects African American children.
											By the time they reach the age of 14,
											one in four black children
will see their dad go off to prison.
											That&#39;s compared to a rate
of one in 30 for white children.
											One key factor determining the future
success of both inmates and their children
											is whether they can maintain ties
during the parent&#39;s incarceration,
											but prisoners&#39; phone calls home
can cost 20 to 30 times more
											than regular phone calls,
											so many families
keep in touch through letters.

											We don&#39;t put checks on prosecutors.
											Across the country,
over the last couple of decades,
											as property and violent crimes
have both fell,
											the number of prosecutors employed
and cases they have filed has risen.
											Prosecutors decide
whether or not to take legal action
											against the people police arrest
											and they decide what charges to file,
											directly impacting how much time
a defendant potentially faces behind bars.
											One check we do have
on prosecutors is defense.
											Imagine Lady Liberty:
											the blindfolded woman holding the scale
											meant to symbolize the balance
in our judicial system.
											Unfortunately, that scale is tipped.
											The majority of defendants in our country
											are represented by
government-appointed attorneys.
											These public defenders
receive around 30 percent less funding
											than district attorneys do,
											and they often have caseloads
far outnumbering
											what the American Bar
