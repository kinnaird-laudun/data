<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Temple Grandin, diagnosed with autism as a child, talks about how her mind works -- sharing her ability to &quot;think in pictures,&quot; which helps her solve problems that neurotypical brains might miss. She makes the case that the world needs people on the autism spectrum: visual thinkers, pattern thinkers, verbal thinkers, and all kinds of smart geeky kids." />

<meta content='Temple Grandin, diagnosed with autism as a child, talks about how her mind works — sharing her ability to "think in pictures," which helps her solve problems that neurotypical brains might miss. She makes the case that the world needs people on the autism spectrum: visual thinkers, pattern thinkers, verbal thinkers, and all kinds of smart geeky kids.' itemprop='description'>

											I think I&#39;ll start out
and just talk a little bit
											about what exactly autism is.
											Autism is a very big continuum
											that goes from very severe —
the child remains nonverbal —
											all the way up to brilliant
scientists and engineers.
											And I actually feel at home here,
											because there&#39;s a lot
of autism genetics here.

											It&#39;s a continuum of traits.
											When does a nerd turn into Asperger,
which is just mild autism?
											I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla
would all be probably diagnosed
											as autistic spectrum today.
											And one of the things
that is really going to concern me
											is getting these kids to be the ones
											that are going to invent
the next energy things
											that Bill Gates talked about this morning.

											OK, now, if you want
to understand autism: animals.
											I want to talk to you now
about different ways of thinking.
											You have to get away from verbal language.
											I think in pictures.
I don&#39;t think in language.
											Now, the thing about the autistic mind
is it attends to details.
											This is a test where you either
have to pick out the big letters
											or the little letters,
											and the autistic mind picks out
the little letters more quickly.

											And the thing is, the normal brain
ignores the details.
											Well, if you&#39;re building a bridge,
details are pretty important
											because it&#39;ll fall down
if you ignore the details.
											And one of my big concerns
with a lot of policy things today
											is things are getting too abstract.
											People are getting away
from doing hands-on stuff.
											I&#39;m really concerned
that a lot of the schools
											have taken out the hands-on classes,
because art, and classes like that —
											those are the classes where I excelled.

											In my work with cattle,
											I noticed a lot of little things
that most people don&#39;t notice
											would make the cattle balk.
											For example, this flag waving
right in front of the veterinary facility.
											This feed yard was going to tear down
their whole veterinary facility;
											all they needed to do was move the flag.
											Rapid movement, contrast.
											In the early &#39;70s when I started,
I got right down in the chutes
											to see what cattle were seeing.
											People thought that was crazy.
											A coat on a fence would make them balk,
shadows would make them balk,
											a hose on the floor —
people weren&#39;t noticing these things.
											A chain hanging down ...
											And that&#39;s shown
very, very nicely in the movie.

											So what is thinking in pictures?
											It&#39;s literally movies in your head.
											My mind works like Google for images.
											When I was a young kid,
I didn&#39;t know my thinking was different.
											I thought everybody thought in pictures.
											Then when I did my book,
&quot;Thinking in Pictures,&quot;
											I started interviewing people
about how they think.
											And I was shocked to find out
that my thinking was quite different.
											Like if I say, &quot;Think
about a church steeple,&quot;
											most people get this sort
of generalized generic one.
											Now, maybe that&#39;s not true in this room,
											but it&#39;s going to be true
in a lot of different places.
											I see only specific pictures.
											They flash up into my memory,
just like Google for pictures.
											And in the movie,
they&#39;ve got a great scene in there,
											where the word &quot;shoe&quot; is said,
and a whole bunch of &#39;50s and &#39;60s shoes
											pop into my imagination.

											OK, how about famous ones?
											And they just kind of come up,
kind of like this.
											Just really quickly,
like Google for pictures.
											And they come up one at a time,

was a tremendous asset

											One of the things I learned very early on
because I wasn&#39;t that social,
											is I had to sell my work, and not myself.
											And the way I sold livestock jobs
is I showed off my drawings,
											I showed off pictures of things.
											Another thing that helped me
as a little kid

you were taught manners.

the merchandise off the shelves
											in the store and throw it around.

											When kids get to be
in third or fourth grade,
											you might see that this kid&#39;s going
to be a visual thinker,
											drawing in perspective.
											Now, I want to emphasize
											that not every autistic kid
is going to be a visual thinker.
											Now, I had this brain scan
done several years ago,
											and I used to joke around about having
a gigantic Internet trunk line
											going deep into my visual cortex.
											This is tensor imaging.
											And my great big Internet trunk line
is twice as big as the control&#39;s.
											The red lines there are me,
											and the blue lines are the sex
and age-matched control.
											And there I got a gigantic one,
											and the control over there, the blue one,
has got a really small one.

											And some of the research now is showing
											that people on the spectrum actually
think with the primary visual cortex.
											Now, the thing is, the visual thinker
is just one kind of mind.
											You see, the autistic mind
tends to be a specialist mind —
											good at one thing, bad at something else.
											And where I was bad was algebra.
											And I was never allowed
to take geometry or trig.
											Gigantic mistake.
											I&#39;m finding a lot of kids
who need to skip algebra,

											Now, another kind of mind
is the pattern thinker.
											More abstract.
											These are your engineers,
your computer programmers.
											This is pattern thinking.
											That praying mantis is made
from a single sheet of paper —
											no scotch tape, no cuts.
											And there in the background
is the pattern for folding it.
											Here are the types of thinking:
											photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me;
											pattern thinkers, music and math minds.
											Some of these oftentimes
have problems with reading.
											You also will see these kind of problems
with kids that are dyslexic.
											You&#39;ll see these different kinds of minds.
											And then there&#39;s a verbal mind,
they know every fact about everything.

to wear this gadget on my face.
											And I came in half an hour beforehand
											so I could have it put on
and kind of get used to it,
											and they got it bent
so it&#39;s not hitting my chin.
											But sensory is an issue.
											Some kids are bothered
by fluorescent lights;

											Now, visual thinking gave me
a whole lot of insight

											Because think about it:
an animal is a sensory-based thinker,
											not verbal — thinks in pictures,
thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.
											Think about how much information
there is on the local fire hydrant.

											When they were there.
											Are they friend or foe?
Is there anybody he can go mate with?
											There&#39;s a ton of information
on that fire hydrant.
											It&#39;s all very detailed information.
											And looking at these kind of details
gave me a lot of insight into animals.

											Now, the animal mind, and also my mind,
											puts sensory-based information
into categories.
											Man on a horse,
											and a man on the ground —
											that is viewed as two
totally different things.
											You could have a horse
that&#39;s been abused by a rider.
											They&#39;ll be absolutely fine
with the veterinarian
											and with the horseshoer,
but you can&#39;t ride him.
											You have another horse,
where maybe the horseshoer beat him up,
											and he&#39;ll be terrible for anything
on the ground with the veterinarian,
											but a person can ride him.
											Cattle are the same way.
											Man on a horse, a man on foot —
they&#39;re two different things.
											You see, it&#39;s a different picture.
											See, I want you to think
about just how specific this is.

information into categories,

are not very good at this.
											When I&#39;m out troubleshooting equipment
											or problems with something in a plant,
											they don&#39;t seem to be able to figure out:
											&quot;Do I have a training-people issue?
											Or do I have something wrong
with the equipment?&quot;
											In other words, categorize
equipment problem from a people problem.
											I find a lot of people
have difficulty doing that.
											Now, let&#39;s say I figure out
it&#39;s an equipment problem.
											Is it a minor problem,
with something simple I can fix?
											Or is the whole design
of the system wrong?

											Let&#39;s just look at something
like, you know,
											solving problems with making
airlines safer.
											Yeah, I&#39;m a million-mile flier.
											I do lots and lots of flying,

											what would I be doing a lot
of direct observation of?

in the last 20 years,

broke in some way.

											And when the pilots walk
around the plane, guess what?

											Now as I think about that,
											I&#39;m pulling up all of that
specific information.
											It&#39;s specific.
											See, my thinking&#39;s bottom-up.
											I take all the little pieces and I put

to be more social.
											And what some of the research

											is there may by extra wiring back here
in the really brilliant mind,

between thinking and social.

we&#39;ve got to look at age.
											If you have a two, three or four-year-old,
no speech, no social interaction,
											I can&#39;t emphasize enough: Don&#39;t wait.
											You need at least 20 hours a week
of one-to-one teaching.
											The thing is, autism comes
in different degrees.
											About half of the people on the spectrum
are not going to learn to talk,
											and they won&#39;t be working
in Silicon Valley.
											That would not be a reasonable
thing for them to do.

geeky kids with a touch of autism,

											I got social interaction
through shared interests —
											I rode horses with other kids,
I made model rockets with other kids,
											did electronics lab with other kids.
											And in the &#39;60s, it was gluing mirrors
onto a rubber membrane on a speaker

cattle-processing facilities in the US, and consults with the meat industry to develop animal welfare guidelines. As PETA wrote when awarding her a 2004 Proggy: &ldquo;Dr. Grandin&#39;s improvements to animal-handling systems found in slaughterhouses have decreased the amount of fear and pain that animals experience in their final hours, and she is widely considered the world&#39;s leading expert on the welfare of cattle and pigs.&rdquo; In 2010, Time Magazine listed her as one of its most Important People of the Year. She is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p><p>Grandin&rsquo;s books about her interior life as an autistic person have increased the world&#39;s understanding of the condition with personal immediacy -- and with import, as rates of autism diagnosis rise. She is revered by animal rights groups and members of autistic community, perhaps because in both regards she is a voice for those who are sometimes challenged to make themselves heard.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Temple Grandin","tags":["Autism spectrum disorder","animals","brain","design","education","invention","mental health","science","technology"],"title":"The world needs all kinds of minds","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":4711410}]}
