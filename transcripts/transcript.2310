<title>Paul Knoepfler: The ethical dilemma of designer babies | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Creating genetically modified people is no longer a science fiction fantasy; it&#39;s a likely future scenario. Biologist Paul Knoepfler estimates that within fifteen years, scientists could use the gene editing technology CRISPR to make certain &quot;upgrades&quot; to human embryos -- from altering physical appearances to eliminating the risk of auto-immune diseases. In this thought-provoking talk, Knoepfler readies us for the coming designer baby revolution and its very personal, and unforeseeable, consequences." />

<meta content='The ethical dilemma of designer babies' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Creating genetically modified people is no longer a science fiction fantasy; it&#x0027;s a likely future scenario. Biologist Paul Knoepfler estimates that within fifteen years, scientists could use the gene editing technology CRISPR to make certain "upgrades" to human embryos — from altering physical appearances to eliminating the risk of auto-immune diseases. In this thought-provoking talk, Knoepfler readies us for the coming designer baby revolution and its very personal, and unforeseeable, consequences.' itemprop='description'>

									<p>
											Marianne&#39;s best friend Jenna,
who lives right next door,
											is a very different story.
											She was born a genetically modified
designer baby with numerous upgrades.
											Yeah. Upgrades.
											And these enhancements were introduced
											using a new genetic
modification technology
											that goes by the funny name CRISPR,
											you know, like something&#39;s crisp,
											this is CRISPR.
											The scientist that Jenna&#39;s parents
hired to do this
											for several million dollars
											introduced CRISPR
into a whole panel of human embryos.
											And then they used genetic testing,
											and they predicted that
that little tiny embryo, Jenna&#39;s embryo,
											would be the best of the bunch.
											And now, Jenna is an actual, real person.
											She&#39;s sitting on the carpet
in your living room
											playing with your daughter Marianne.
											And your families have known
each other for years now,
											and it&#39;s become very clear to you
											that Jenna is extraordinary.
											She&#39;s incredibly intelligent.
											If you&#39;re honest with yourself,
she&#39;s smarter than you,
											and she&#39;s five years old.
											She&#39;s beautiful, tall, athletic,
											and the list goes on and on.
											And in fact, there&#39;s
a whole new generation
											of these GM kids like Jenna.
											And so far it looks like
											they&#39;re healthier
than their parents&#39; generation,
											than your generation.
											And they have lower health care costs.
											They&#39;re immune to a host
of health conditions,
											including HIV/AIDS and genetic diseases.

											It all sounds so great,
											but you can&#39;t help but have
this sort of unsettling feeling,
											a gut feeling, that there&#39;s something
just not quite right about Jenna,
											and you&#39;ve had the same feeling
about other GM kids that you&#39;ve met.
											You were also reading
in the newspaper earlier this week
											that a study of these children
who were born as designer babies
											indicates they may have some issues,
											like increased aggressiveness
and narcissism.
											But more immediately on your mind
											is some news that you just got
from Jenna&#39;s family.
											She&#39;s so smart,
											she&#39;s now going to be going
to a special school,
											a different school
than your daughter Marianne,
											and this is kind of throwing
your family into a disarray.
											Marianne&#39;s been crying,
											and last night when you took her to bed
to kiss her goodnight,
											she said, &quot;Daddy, will Jenna
even be my friend anymore?&quot;

											So now, as I&#39;ve been telling you
this imagined 2030 story,
											I have a feeling
that I may have put some of you
											into this sci-fi
frame of reference. Right?
											You think you&#39;re reading a sci-fi book.
											Or maybe, like,
in Halloween mode of thinking.
											But this is really
a possible reality for us,

											I&#39;m a stem cell and genetics researcher
											and I can see this new CRISPR technology
											and its potential impact.
											And we may find ourselves in that reality,
											and a lot will depend
on what we decide to do today.
											And if you&#39;re still
kind of thinking in sci-fi mode,
											consider that the world of science
had a huge shock earlier this year,
											and the public largely
doesn&#39;t even know about it.
											Researchers in China just a few months ago
											reported the creation
of genetically modified human embryos.
											This was the first time in history.
											And they did it using
this new CRISPR technology.
											It didn&#39;t work perfectly,
											but I still think
they sort of cracked the door ajar
											on a Pandora&#39;s box here.
											And I think some people
are going to run with this technology
											and try to make designer babies.

											Now, before I go on, some of you
may hold up your hands and say,
											&quot;Stop, Paul, wait a minute.
											Wouldn&#39;t that be illegal?
											You can&#39;t just go off
and create a designer baby.&quot;
											And in fact, to some extent, you&#39;re right.
											In some countries, you couldn&#39;t do that.
											But in many other countries,
including my country, the US,
											there&#39;s actually no law on this,
so in theory, you could do it.
											And there was another development
this year that resonates in this area,
											and that happened
not so far from here over in the UK.
											And the UK traditionally
has been the strictest country
											when it comes to human
genetic modification.
											It was illegal there,
											but just a few months ago,
											they carved out an exception to that rule.
											They passed a new law
											allowing the creation
of genetically modified humans
											with the noble goal of trying
to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.
											But still I think in combination
these events are pushing us
											further towards an acceptance
											of human genetic modification.

											So I&#39;ve been talking
about this CRISPR technology.
											What actually is CRISPR?
											So if you think about the GMOs
that we&#39;re all more familiar with,
											like GMO tomatoes and wheat
											and things like that,
											this technology
is similar to the technologies
											that were used to make those,
											but it&#39;s dramatically better,
											cheaper and faster.

									<p>
											So what is it?
											It&#39;s actually like
a genetic Swiss army knife.
											We can pretend this is a Swiss army knife
											with different tools in it,
											and one of the tools
is kind of like a magnifying glass
											or a GPS for our DNA,
											so it can home in on a certain spot.
											And the next tool is like scissors
											that can cut the DNA right in that spot.
											And finally we have a pen
											where we can literally rewrite
the genetic code in that location.
											It&#39;s really that simple.

									<p>
											And this technology, which came
on the scene just three years ago,
											has taken science by storm.
											It&#39;s evolving so fast, and it&#39;s
so freaking exciting to scientists,
											and I admit I&#39;m fascinated by it
and we use it in my own lab,
											that I think someone
is going to go that extra step
											and continue the GM human embryo work
											and maybe make designer babies.
											This is so ubiquitous now.
											It just came on the scene three years ago.
											Thousands of labs
literally have this in hand today,
											and they&#39;re doing important research.
											Most of them are not interested
in designer babies.
											They&#39;re studying human disease
											and other important elements of science.
											So there&#39;s a lot of good research
going on with CRISPR.
											And the fact that we can
now do genetic modifications
											that used to take years
and cost millions of dollars
											in a few weeks
for a couple thousand bucks,
											to me as a scientist that&#39;s fantastic,
											but again, at the same time,
											it opens the door to people going too far.
											And I think for some people
											the focus is not going to be
so much on science.
											That&#39;s not what&#39;s going
to be driving them.
											It&#39;s going to be ideology
or the chase for a profit.
											And they&#39;re going to go
for designer babies.

									<p>
											So why should we be concerned about this?
											We know from Darwin,
if we go back two centuries,
											that evolution and genetics
profoundly have impacted humanity,
											who we are today.
											And some think there&#39;s like
a social Darwinism at work in our world,
											and maybe even a eugenics as well.
											Imagine those trends, those forces,
											with a booster rocket
of this CRISPR technology
											that is so powerful and so ubiquitous.
											And in fact, we can just go back
one century to the last century
											to see the power that eugenics can have.

											So my father, Peter Knoepfler,
											was actually born right here in Vienna.
											He was Viennese,
and he was born here in 1929.
											And when my grandparents
had little baby Peter,
											the world was very different. Right?
											It was a different Vienna.
											The United States was different.
											The world was different.
											There was a eugenics rising,
											and my grandparents realized,
											pretty quickly I think,
											that they were on the wrong side
of the eugenics equation.
											And so despite this being their home
											and their whole extended family&#39;s home,
											and this area being their family&#39;s
home for generations,
											they decided because of eugenics
											that they had to leave.
											And they survived,
but they were heartbroken,
											and I&#39;m not sure my dad
ever really got over leaving Vienna.
											He left when he was just eight years old
											in 1938.

											So today, I see a new eugenics
											kind of bubbling to the surface.
											It&#39;s supposed to be a kinder,
gentler, positive eugenics,
											different than all that past stuff.
											But I think even though it&#39;s focused
on trying to improve people,
											it could have negative consequences,
											and it really worries me
											that some of the top proponents
of this new eugenics,
											they think CRISPR is the ticket
to make it happen.

											So I have to admit, you know,
											eugenics, we talk
about making better people.
											It&#39;s a tough question.
											What is better when we&#39;re talking
about a human being?
											But I admit I think maybe a lot of us
											could agree that human beings,
											maybe we could use a little betterment.
											Look at our politicians
											here, you know, back in the US —
											God forbid we go there right now.
											Maybe even if we just look in the mirror,
											there might be ways
we think we could be better.
											I might wish, honestly, that I had
more hair here, instead of baldness.
											Some people might wish they were taller,
											have a different weight, a different face.
											If we could do those things,
we could make those things happen,
											or we could make them happen
in our children,
											it would be very seductive.
											And yet coming with it
would be these risks.
											I talked about eugenics,
											but there would be risks
to individuals as well.
											So if we forget about enhancing people
											and we just try to make them
healthier using genetic modification,
											this technology is so new
											and so powerful,
											that by accident
we could make them sicker.
											That easily could happen.
											And there&#39;s another risk,
											and that is that all of the legitimate,
important genetic modification research
											going on just in the lab —
											again, no interest in designer babies —
											a few people going
the designer baby route,
											things go badly,
											that entire field could be damaged.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I also think it&#39;s not that unlikely
											that governments might start taking
an interest in genetic modification.
											So for example our imagined GM Jenna child
											who is healthier,
											if there&#39;s a generation that looks
like they have lower health care costs,
											it&#39;s possible that governments
may start trying to compel their citizens
											to go the GM route.
											Look at China&#39;s one-child policy.
											It&#39;s thought that that prevented
the birth of 400 million human beings.
											So it&#39;s not beyond the realm of possible
											that genetic modification
could be something that governments push.
											And if designer babies become popular,
											in our digital age —
											viral videos, social media —
											what if designer babies
are thought to be fashionable,
											and they kind of become
the new glitterati,
											the new Kardashians or something?

											So again, today it&#39;s Halloween
											and when we talk
about genetic modification,
											there&#39;s one Halloween-associated character
											that is talked about
or invoked more than anything else,
											and that is Frankenstein.
											Mostly that&#39;s been Frankenfoods
and all this other stuff.
											But if we think about this now
and we think about it in the human context
											on a day like Halloween,
											if parents can in essence
costume their children genetically,
											are we going to be talking about
a Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation?
											I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t think
it&#39;s going to get to that extreme.
											But when we are going about
hacking the human code,
											I think all bets are off
in terms of what might come of that.
											There would still be dangers.
											And we can look in the past
											to other elements
of transformative science
											and see how they can
basically go out of control
											and permeate society.

									<p>
											So I&#39;ll just give you one example,
and that is in vitro fertilization.
											Almost exactly 40 years ago,
											test tube baby number one
Louise Brown was born,
											and that&#39;s a great thing,
											and I think since then
five million IVF babies have been born,
											bringing immeasurable happiness.
											A lot of parents now can love those kids.
											But if you think about it,
in four decades,
											five million babies being born
from a new technology
											is pretty remarkable,
											and the same kind of thing could happen
											with human genetic modification
and designer babies.
											So depending on the decisions
we make in the next few months,
											the next year or so,
											if designer baby number one is born,
											within a few decades,
											there could well be millions
of genetically modified humans.
											And there&#39;s a difference there too,
because if we, you in the audience, or I,
											if we decide to have a designer baby,
											then their children will also
be genetically modified, and so on,
											because it&#39;s heritable.
											So that&#39;s a big difference.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So with all of this in mind,
											what should we do?
											There&#39;s actually going to be a meeting
											a month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C.
											by the US National Academy of Sciences
											to tackle that exact question.
											What is the right path forward
with human genetic modification?
											I believe at this time
											we need a moratorium.
											We have to ban this.
											We should not allow
creating genetically modified people,
											because it&#39;s just too dangerous
and too unpredictable.
											But there&#39;s a lot of people —

									<p>
											And let me say, just as a scientist,
											it&#39;s a little bit scary
for me to say that in public,
											because science generally doesn&#39;t like
self-regulation and things like that.
											So I think we need to put a hold on this,
											but there are many people
who not only disagree with me,
											they feel the exact opposite.
											They&#39;re like, step on the gas,
full speed ahead,
											let&#39;s make designer babies.
											And so in the meeting in December
											and other meetings that are likely
to follow in the next few months,
											it&#39;s very possible
there may be no moratorium.
											And I think part
of the problem that we have
											is that all of this trend,
											this revolution in genetic modification
applying to humans,
											the public hasn&#39;t known about it.
											Nobody has been saying,
											look, this is a big deal,
this is a revolution,
											and this could affect you
in very personal ways.
											And so part of my goal
is actually to change that
											and to educate and engage with the public
											and get you guys talking about this.
											And so I hope at these meetings
that there will be a role for the public
											to bring their voice to bear as well.

											So if we kind of circle back now
to 2030 again, that imagined story,
											and depending on the decisions
we make, again, today —
											literally we don&#39;t have a lot of time —
											in the next few months,
the next year or so,
											because this technology
is spreading like wildfire.
											Let&#39;s pretend we&#39;re back in that reality.
											We&#39;re at a park,
											and our kid is swinging on the swing.
											Is that kid a regular old kid,
											or did we decide to have a designer baby?
											And let&#39;s say we went
the sort of traditional route,
											and there&#39;s our kid swinging on the swing,
											and frankly, they&#39;re kind of a mess.
											Their hair is all over
the place like mine.
											They have a stuffy nose.
											They&#39;re not the best student in the world.
											They&#39;re adorable, you love them,
											but there on the swing next to them,
											their best friend is a GM kid,
											and the two of them
are kind of swinging like this,
											and you can&#39;t help
but compare them, right?
											And the GM kid is swinging higher,
											they look better,
they&#39;re a better student,
											they don&#39;t have that stuffy nose
you need to wipe.
											How is that going to make you feel
											and what decision
might you make next time?

Knoepfler is a biomedical scientist and writer focusing on stem cells and genetics.","whylisten":"<p>Dr. Paul Knoepfler loves stem cells. He is working to figure out how we use safely them to treat many diseases and how stem cells sometimes turn to the dark side to cause cancer. Over the years he has made key discoveries about how stem cells and cancer are programmed. Now he is especially interested in how to hack these cells to control their behavior, including using powerful CRISPR genetic modification technology.</p><p>Knoepfler has also been a leading voice in the discussion about how CRISPR could be used to make designer babies and the risks of going down that path. He is a professor of cell biology and anatomy at UC Davis School of Medicine in California, where he both does research and teaches. In addition, he is a prolific writer including his popular science blog,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ipscell.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Niche</a>, and two books:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/EqRlv\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Stem Cells: An Insider&#39;s Guide</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/bYS8L\" target=\"_blank\"><em>GMO Sapiens: The Life-Changing Science of Designer Babies</em></a>. He is excited about contributing to efforts to build an innovative, global community of interconnected people with a shared passion for biomedical science and battling fake science. Knoepfler&rsquo;s outspoken, approachable nature in tackling some of the most transformative questions in science has made him a go-to scientist for journalists and ordinary people across the globe.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Paul Knoepfler","tags":["AIDS","bioethics","biology","biotech","children","choice","discovery","DNA","CRISPR","genetics","HIV","health","humanity","innovation","molecular biology","identity","nature","parenting","policy","science","social change","society","technology","TEDx"],"title":"The ethical dilemma of designer babies","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1221360}]}
