											Chris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here

											So Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director
											of the National Security Agency,
											and he&#39;s a senior civilian officer there,
											acts as its chief operating officer,
											guiding strategies, setting internal policies,
											and serving as the principal advisor to the director.
											And all being well,
											welcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED.

											CA: Thank you, Rick.
											We appreciate you joining us.
											It&#39;s certainly quite a strong statement
											that the NSA is willing to reach out
											and show a more open face here.
											You saw, I think,
											the talk and interview that Edward Snowden
											gave here a couple days ago.
											What did you make of it?
											RL: So I think it was interesting.
											We didn&#39;t realize that he 
was going to show up there,
											so kudos to you guys for arranging
											a nice surprise like that.
											I think that, like a lot of the things
											that have come out since Mr. Snowden
											started disclosing classified information,
											there were some kernels of truth in there,
											but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,
											and I&#39;m interested in helping to address those.
											I think this is a really important conversation
											that we&#39;re having in the United States
											and internationally,
											and I think it is important and of import,
											and so given that, we need to have that be
											a fact-based conversation,
											and we want to help make that happen.

											CA: So the question that a lot 
of people have here is,
											what do you make of Snowden&#39;s motivations
											for doing what he did,
											and did he have an alternative
way that he could have gone?

									<p>
											RL: He absolutely did
											have alternative ways that he could have gone,
											and I actually think that characterizing him
											as a whistleblower
											actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities.
											So what if somebody who works in the NSA —
											and there are over 35,000 people who do.
											They&#39;re all great citizens.
											They&#39;re just like your husbands, fathers, sisters,
											brothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives,
											all of whom are interested in doing the right thing
											for their country
											and for our allies internationally,
											and so there are a variety of venues to address
											if folks have a concern.
											First off, there&#39;s their supervisor,
											and up through the supervisory chain
											within their organization.
											If folks aren&#39;t comfortable with that,
											there are a number of inspectors general.
											In the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option
											of the NSA inspector general,
											the Navy inspector general,
											the Pacific Command inspector general,
											the Department of Defense inspector general,
											and the intelligence community inspector general,
											any of whom would have both kept
his concerns in classified channels
											and been happy to address them.
											(CA and RL speaking at once)
											He had the option to go to
congressional committees,
											and there are mechanisms
to do that that are in place,
											and so he didn&#39;t do any of those things.

											CA: Now, you had said that
											Ed Snowden had other avenues
											for raising his concerns.
											The comeback on that is a couple of things:
											one, that he certainly believes that as a contractor,
											the avenues that would have been available
to him as an employee weren&#39;t available,

											so when we have foreign intelligence targets,
											legitimate things of interest —
											like, terrorists is the iconic example,

											people who are trying to build
advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,
											and build delivery systems for those,

											and recognize, &quot;Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,&quot;
											they move away from that,

											moved away from our ability

											RL: So there are, when our
											legitimate foreign intelligence targets
of the type that I described before,
											use the global telecommunications system
											as their communications methodology,
											and they do, because it&#39;s a great system,
											it&#39;s the most complex system ever devised by man,
											and it is a wonder,
											and lots of folks in the room there
											are responsible for the creation
											and enhancement of that,
											and it&#39;s just a wonderful thing.
											But it&#39;s also used by people who are
											working against us and our allies.
											And so if I&#39;m going to pursue them,
											I need to have the capability
											to go after them,
											and again, the controls are in
											how I apply that capability,
											not that I have the capability itself.
											Otherwise, if we could make it so that
											all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,
											we could have a domain, badguy.com.
											That would be awesome,
											and we could just concentrate all our efforts there.
											That&#39;s not how it works.
											They&#39;re trying to hide
											from the government&#39;s ability
											to isolate and interdict their actions,
											and so we have to swim in that same space.
											But I will tell you this.
											So NSA has two missions.
											One is the Signals Intelligence mission
											that we&#39;ve unfortunately read so
much about in the press.
											The other one is the Information Assurance mission,
											which is to protect the national security
systems of the United States,
											and by that, that&#39;s things like
											the communications that the president uses,
											the communications that
control our nuclear weapons,
											the communications that our
military uses around the world,
											and the communications that we use with our allies,
											and that some of our allies themselves use.
											And so we make recommendations
on standards to use,
											and we use those same standards,

											in making sure that those communications

											It is a global telecommunications system.
											The Internet is a big chunk of 
that, but there is a lot more.

											there are things that we need
to be transparent about:

											There&#39;s takeoffs of our logo
											of an eagle with headphones on around it.

transparent about those things.

											CA: But isn&#39;t it also bad to deal
											a kind of body blow to the American companies

											most of the Internet services that matter?
											RL: It is. It&#39;s really the companies are
											in a tough position, as are we,
											because the companies,
											we compel them to provide information,
											just like every other nation in the world does.
											Every industrialized nation in the world
											has a lawful intercept program
											where they are requiring companies
											to provide them with information
											that they need for their security,

											have complied with those programs
											in the same way that they have to do
											when they&#39;re operating in Russia or the U.K.
											or China or India or France,
											any country that you choose to name.

											have been broadly characterized as
											&quot;you can&#39;t trust company A because
											your privacy is suspect with them&quot;
											is actually only accurate in the sense that

											And we devote an inordinate

											inordinate and appropriate, actually I should say,
											amount of time and effort in order to ensure
											that we protect that privacy.
											and beyond that, the privacy of citizens
											around the world, it&#39;s not just Americans.

											First, we&#39;re all in the same network.
											My communications,
											I&#39;m a user of a particular Internet email service
											that is the number one email service of choice
											by terrorists around the world, number one.
											So I&#39;m there right beside them in email space
											in the Internet.
											And so we need to be able to pick that apart
											and find the information that&#39;s relevant.
											In doing so, we&#39;re going to necessarily encounter
											Americans and innocent foreign citizens
											who are just going about their business,
											and so we have procedures in
place that shreds that out,
											that says, when you find that,
											not if you find it, when you find it,
because you&#39;re certain to find it,
											here&#39;s how you protect that.
											These are called minimization procedures.
											They&#39;re approved by the attorney general
											and constitutionally based.
											And so we protect those.
											And then, for people, citizens of the world
											who are going about their lawful business
											on a day-to-day basis,
											the president on his January 17 speech,
											laid out some additional protections
											that we are providing to them.
											So I think absolutely,

									<p>
											RL: I don&#39;t really understand that argument.
											I think that metadata&#39;s important
for a couple of reasons.
											Metadata is the information that lets you
											find connections that people are trying to hide.
											So when a terrorist is corresponding
											with somebody else who&#39;s not known to us
											but is engaged in doing or
supporting terrorist activity,
											or someone who&#39;s violating international sanctions
											by providing nuclear weapons-related material
											to a country like Iran or North Korea,
											is trying to hide that activity
because it&#39;s illicit activity.
											What metadata lets you do is connect that.
											The alternative to that
											is one that&#39;s much less efficient
											and much more invasive of privacy,
											which is gigantic amounts of content collection.
											So metadata, in that sense,
											actually is privacy-enhancing.
											And we don&#39;t, contrary to some of the stuff
											that&#39;s been printed,
											we don&#39;t sit there and grind out
											metadata profiles of average people.
											If you&#39;re not connected
											to one of those valid intelligence targets,
											you are not of interest to us.

											RL: I think terrorism is still number one.
											I think that we have never been in a time
											where there are more places
											where things are going badly
											and forming the petri dish in which terrorists
											take advantage of the lack of governance.
											An old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,
											used to describe it as arcs of instability.
											And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability
											in the world right now,
											in places like Syria, where there&#39;s a civil war
											going on and you have massive numbers,
											thousands and thousands of foreign fighters
											who are coming into Syria
											to learn how to be terrorists
											and practice that activity,
											and lots of those people are Westerners
											who hold passports to European countries
											or in some cases the United States,
											and so they are basically learning how
											to do jihad and have expressed intent
											to go out and do that later on
											in their home countries.
											You&#39;ve got places like Iraq,
											which is suffering from a high
level of sectarian violence,
											again a breeding ground for terrorism.
											And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa
											and the Sahel area of Africa.
											Again, lots of weak governance
											which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.
											So I think it&#39;s very serious. I think it&#39;s number one.
											I think number two is cyber threat.
											I think cyber is a threat in three ways:
											One way, and probably the most common way
											that people have heard about it,
											is due to the theft of intellectual property,
											so basically, foreign countries going in,
											stealing companies&#39; secrets,
											and then providing that information
											to state-owned enterprises
											or companies connected to the government
											to help them leapfrog technology
											or to gain business intelligence
											that&#39;s then used to win contracts overseas.
											That is a hugely costly set of
activities that&#39;s going on right now.
											Several nation-states are doing it.
											Second is the denial-of-service attacks.
											You&#39;re probably aware that there have been
											a spate of those directed against
											the U.S. financial sector since 2012.
											Again, that&#39;s a nation-state who
is executing those attacks,
											and they&#39;re doing that
											as a semi-anonymous way of reprisal.
											And the last one is destructive attacks,
											and those are the ones that concern me the most.
											Those are on the rise.
											You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012,
											August of 2012.
											It took down about 35,000 of their computers
											with a Wiper-style virus.
											You had a follow-on a week later
											to a Qatari company.
											You had March of 2013,
											you had a South Korean attack
											that was attributed in the press to North Korea
											that took out thousands of computers.
											Those are on the rise,
											and we see people expressing interest
											in those capabilities
											and a desire to employ them.

											don&#39;t understand this belief that terrorism
											is still the number one threat.
											Apart from September 11,

											RL: Well, I&#39;d say two things.
											One is, the reason that there hasn&#39;t been
											a major attack in the United States since 9/11,
											that is not an accident.
											That&#39;s a lot of hard work that we have done,
											that other folks
											in the intelligence community have done,
											that the military has done,
											and that our allies around the globe have done.
											You&#39;ve heard the numbers about
											the tip of the iceberg in terms
											of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs
											contributed to stopping was 54,
											25 of those in Europe,
											and of those 25,
											18 of them occurred in three countries,
											some of which are our allies,
											and some of which are beating the heck out of us
											over the NSA programs, by the way.
											So that&#39;s not an accident that those things happen.
											That&#39;s hard work. That&#39;s us finding intelligence
											on terrorist activities
											and interdicting them through one way or another,
											through law enforcement,
											through cooperative activities with other countries
											and sometimes through military action.
											The other thing I would say is that
											your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat
											is not at all far-fetched
											and in fact there are a number of groups
											who have for several years expressed interest
											and desire in obtaining those capabilities
											and work towards that.

											RL: No, there&#39;s actually two programs
											that are typically implicated in that discussion.
											One is the section 215 program,
											the U.S. telephony metadata program,
											and the other one is
											popularly called the PRISM program,
											and it&#39;s actually section 702 
of the FISA Amendment Act.
											But the 215 program
											is only relevant to threats
											that are directed against the United States,
											and there have been a dozen threats
											where that was implicated.
											Now what you&#39;ll see people say publicly
											is there is no &quot;but for&quot; case,
											and so there is no case where, but for that,
											the threat would have happened.
											But that actually indicates a lack of understanding
											of how terrorist investigations actually work.
											You think about on television,
											you watch a murder mystery.
											What do you start with? You start with a body,
											and then they work their way
from there to solve the crime.
											We&#39;re actually starting well before that,
											hopefully before there are any bodies,
											and we&#39;re trying to build the case for
											who the people are, what they&#39;re trying to do,
											and that involves massive amounts of information.
											Think of it is as mosaic,
											and it&#39;s hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic
											was necessary to building the mosaic,
											but to build the complete picture,
											you need to have all the pieces of information.
											On the other, the non-U.S.-related
threats out of those 54,
											the other 42 of them,
											the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that,
											and in fact was material in contributing
											to stopping those attacks.

											CA: Snowden said two days ago

											that it&#39;s something that,

											RL: Yeah.
											I mean, we debate these things all the time,
											and there is discussion that goes on
											in the executive branch
											and within NSA itself
											and the intelligence community about
											what&#39;s right, what&#39;s proportionate,
											what&#39;s the correct thing to do.
											And it&#39;s important to note that the programs
											that we&#39;re talking about
											were all authorized by two different presidents,
											two different political parties,
											by Congress twice,
											and by federal judges 16 different times,
											and so this is not NSA running off
											and doing its own thing.
											This is a legitimate activity
											of the United States foreign government
											that was agreed to by all the branches
											of the United States government,
											and President Madison would have been proud.

											CA: And yet, when congressmen discovered
											what was actually being done

											many of them were completely shocked.
											Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction,
											that it&#39;s only because it&#39;s now come out publicly,

											RL: Congress is a big body.
											There&#39;s 535 of them,
											and they change out frequently,
											in the case of the House, every two years,
											and I think that the NSA provided
											all the relevant information
to our oversight committees,
											and then the dissemination of that information
											by the oversight committees throughout Congress
											is something that they manage.
											I think I would say that Congress members
											had the opportunity to make themselves aware,
											and in fact a significant number of them,
											the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility,
											did have the ability to do that.
											And you&#39;ve actually had the chairs of
those committees say that in public.
											CA: Now, you mentioned the 
threat of cyberattacks,
											and I don&#39;t think anyone in this room would disagree
											that that is a huge concern,
											but do you accept that there&#39;s a tradeoff
											between offensive and defensive strategies,
											and that it&#39;s possible that the very measures taken
											to, &quot;weaken encryption,&quot;
											and allow yourself to find the bad guys,
											might also open the door to forms of cyberattack?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											RL: So I think two things.
											One is, you said weaken encryption. I didn&#39;t.
											And the other one is that
											the NSA has both of those missions,
											and we are heavily biased towards defense,
											and, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find
											in the overwhelming majority of cases,
											we disclose to the people who are responsible
											for manufacturing or developing those products.
											We have a great track record of that,
											and we&#39;re actually working on a proposal right now
											to be transparent and to
publish transparency reports
											in the same way that the Internet companies
											are being allowed to publish
transparency reports for them.
											We want to be more transparent about that.
											So again, we eat our own dog food.
											We use the standards, we use the products
											that we recommend,
											and so it&#39;s in our interest
											to keep our communications protected
											in the same way that other people&#39;s need to be.

											CA: Edward Snowden,
											when, after his talk, was wandering the halls here
											in the bot,
											and I heard him say to a couple of people,
											they asked him about what he thought
											of the NSA overall,
											and he was very complimentary about the people
											who work with you,
											said that it&#39;s a really
											impassioned group of employees
											who are seeking to do the right thing,
											and that the problems have come from
											just some badly conceived policies.
											He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly.
											He didn&#39;t come over like a crazy man.
											Would you accept that at least,
											even if you disagree with how he did it,
											that he has opened a debate that matters?

									<p>
											RL: So I think that the discussion
											is an important one to have.
											I do not like the way that he did it.
											I think there were a number of other ways
											that he could have done that
											that would have not endangered our people
											and the people of other nations
											through losing visibility
											into what our adversaries are doing.

											CA: It&#39;s been reported that there&#39;s
											almost a difference of opinion
											with you and your colleagues
											over any scenario in which
											he might be offered an amnesty deal.
											I think your boss, General Keith Alexander,
											has said that that would be a terrible example
											for others;
											you can&#39;t negotiate with someone
											who&#39;s broken the law in that way.
											But you&#39;ve been quoted as saying that,
											if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering
											all undisclosed documents,
											that a deal maybe should be considered.
											Do you still think that?

											RL: Yeah, so actually,
											this is my favorite thing about
that &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview
											was all the misquotes that came from that.
											What I actually said, in 
response to a question about,
											would you entertain any discussions
											of mitigating action against Snowden,
											I said, yeah, it&#39;s worth a conversation.
											This is something that the attorney general
											of the United States and the president also
											actually have both talked about this,
											and I defer to the attorney general,
											because this is his lane.
											But there is a strong tradition
											in American jurisprudence
											of having discussions with people
											who have been charged with crimes in order to,
											if it benefits the government,
											to get something out of that,
											that there&#39;s always room for that kind of discussion.
											So I&#39;m not presupposing any outcome,

											in terms of putting things right
											and helping figure out a smarter policy,
											a smarter way forward for the future.
											Do you see, has that kind of possibility
											been entertained at all?

											That&#39;s not an NSA thing.
											That would be a Department of Justice

											RL: So I think, learn the facts.
											This is a really important conversation,
											and it impacts, it&#39;s not just NSA,
											it&#39;s not just the government,
											it&#39;s you, it&#39;s the Internet companies.
											The issue of privacy and personal data
											is much bigger than just the government,
											and so learn the facts.
											Don&#39;t rely on headlines,
											don&#39;t rely on sound bites,
											don&#39;t rely on one-sided conversations.
											So that&#39;s the idea, I think, worth spreading.
											We have a sign, a badge tab,
											we wear badges at work with lanyards,
											and if I could make a plug,
											my badge lanyard at work says, &quot;Dallas Cowboys.&quot;
											Go Dallas.
											I&#39;ve just alienated half the audience, I know.
											So the lanyard that our people
											who work in the organization
											that does our crypto-analytic work
											have a tab that says, &quot;Look at the data.&quot;
											So that&#39;s the idea worth spreading.
											Look at the data.
