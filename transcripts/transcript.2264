											In 1975, when I was seven years old,
											women in Iceland went on a strike.
											They did no work that day,
											whether they held professional jobs
											or had the work of the home.
											They marched into
the center of Reykjavík —
											90 percent of women participated —
											and peacefully and in solidarity
											asked for equality.
											Nothing worked in Iceland that day,
											because nothing works
when women are not at work.

											Five years later,
Icelanders had the courage
											to be the first country in the world
											to democratically elect a woman
as their president.
											I will never forget this day,
											that President Vigdís,
as we know her by her first name,
											stepped out on the balcony
of her own home,
											a single mom with her daughter
by her side as she had won.

											This woman was an incredible role model
											for me and everyone
growing up at that time,
											including boys.
											She frequently shares the story
of how a young boy approached her
											after a couple of terms in office
											and asked, &quot;Can boys
really grow up to be president?&quot;

									<p>
											Role models really matter,
											but even with such strong role models
											who I am so grateful for,
											when I was encouraged
to run for president,
											my first reaction was,
&quot;Who am I to run for president?
											Who am I to be president?&quot;

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											It turns out that women
											are less likely
to consider running than men.
											So a study done in the US in 2011
											showed that 62 percent of men
had considered running for office,
											but 45 percent of women.
											That&#39;s gap of 16 percentage points,
											and it&#39;s the same gap
that existed a decade earlier.
											And it really is a shame,
											because I am so convinced that the world
is in real need for women leaders
											and more principle-based leadership
											in general.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So my decision to run
											ultimately came down to the fact
											that I felt
											that I had to do my bit,
											even if I had no political experience,
											to step up and try to be part
of creating the world
											that will make sense and be sustainable
											for our kids,
											and a world where we truly allow
both our boys and girls
											to be all they can be.

											I can assure you
we had our own drama in Iceland.
											So our sitting president of 20 years
											announced initially
that he was not going to run,
											which is probably what gave rise
											to so many candidates considering running.
											Then later he changed his mind
											when our prime minister resigned
											following the infamous Panama Papers
											that implicated him and his family.
											And there was a popular
protest in Iceland,
											so the sitting president thought
they needed a trusted leader.
											A few days later, relations
to his wife and her family&#39;s companies
											were also discovered in the Panama Papers,
											and so he withdrew from the race again.
											Before doing so, he said he was doing that
											because now there were two qualified men
											who he felt could fill his shoes
running for office.

											So on May 9, 45 days before election day,
											it was not looking too good for me.
											I did not even make the graph
in the newspaper.
											The polls had me at 1 percent,
											but that was still the highest
											that any woman announcing
her candidacy had earned.
											So it would be an understatement
to say that I had to work extremely hard
											to get my seat at the table
											and access to television,
											because the network decided
that they would only include
											those with 2.5 percent
or more in the polls
											in the first TV debate.
											I found out on the afternoon
of the first TV debate
											that I would participate
along with the three men,
											and I found out on live TV
											that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent
on the day of the first TV debate.

											So, challenges.
											The foremost challenges I had to face
and overcome on this journey
											had to do with media, muscle and money.
											Let&#39;s start with media.
											There are those who say
gender doesn&#39;t matter
											when it comes to media and politics.
											I can&#39;t say that I agree.
											It proved harder for me
to both get access and airtime in media.
											As a matter of fact, the leading candidate
appeared in broadcast media
											87 times in the months
leading up to the elections,
											whereas I appeared 31 times.
											And I am not saying
media is doing this consciously.
											I think largely this has to do
with unconscious bias,
											because in media,
much like everywhere else,
											we have both conscious
and unconscious bias,
											and we need to have the courage
to talk about it if we want to change it.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											When I finally got access to TV,
											the first question I got was,
&quot;Are you going to quit?&quot;
											And that was a hard one.
											But of course, with 1 percent
to 2.5 percent in the polls,
											maybe it&#39;s understandable.
											But media really matters,
and every time I appeared on TV,
											we saw and experienced
a rise in the polls,
											so I know firsthand how much this matters
											and why we have to talk about it.
											I was the only one
out of the final four candidates
											that never got a front page interview.
											I was sometimes left out of the questions
asked of all other candidates
											and out of coverage about the elections.
											So I did face this,
											but I will say this
to compliment the Icelandic media.
											I got few if any comments
about my hair and pantsuit.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So kudos to them.
											But there is another experience
that&#39;s very important.
											I ran as an independent candidate,
											not with any political party
or muscle behind me.
											That lack of experience
											and lack of access to resources
											probably came at a cost to our campaign,
											but it also allowed us to innovate
and do politics differently.
											We ran a positive campaign,
											and we probably changed the tone
of the election for others by doing that.
											It may be the reason
why I had less airtime on TV,
											because I wanted to show
other contenders respect.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											When access to media
proved to be so difficult,
											we ran our own media.
											I ran live Facebook sessions
											where I took questions from voters
on anything and responded on the spot.
											And we put all the questions I got
and all the answers on an open Facebook
											because we thought
transparency is important
											if you want to establish trust.
											And when reaching young voters
proved to be challenging,
											I became a Snapchatter.
											I got young people
to teach me how to do that,
											and I used every filter on Snapchat
during the last part of the campaign.
											And I actually had to use a lot of humor
and humility, as I was very bad at it.
											But we grew the following
amongst young people by doing that.
											So it&#39;s possible to run
a different type of campaign.

									<p>
											But unfortunately, one cannot talk
about politics without mentioning money.
											I am sad that it is that way,
but it&#39;s true,
											and we had less financial resources
than the other candidates.
											This probably was partly due to the fact
											that I think I had a harder time
asking for financial support.
											And maybe I also had the ambition
to do more with less.
											Some would call that very womanly of me.

											PM: I can&#39;t let you go
without saying
											that probably everybody in the room
is ready to move to Iceland
											and vote for you.
											But of course we probably
can&#39;t vote there,
											but one thing we can get from Iceland
											and have always gotten is inspiration.
											I mean, I&#39;m old enough to remember 1975
											when all the Icelandic women walked out,
											and that really was a very big factor
in launching the women&#39;s movement.
											You made a reference to it earlier.
I&#39;d love to bring the picture back up
											and just have us remember what it was like
when a country came to a standstill.
											And then what you may not know
											because our American media
did not report it,
											the Icelandic women
walked out again on Monday. Right?

after the original strike,
											we may be the best place
in the world to be a woman,

they had earned their day&#39;s salary.

She was the most sincere-looking human being I have ever seen, a living emoji of sincerity: her head gently tilted to one side, her face a perfect equation of warm smile and worried, caring expression.

She infused the world of finance with “feminine values,\" which helped her survive the financial meltdown in Iceland and nearly made her president.","whylisten":"<p>T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir&#39;s philosophy is simple: (1) the challenges we&#39;re facing today won&#39;t be solved by testosterone alone; (2) the world would be a better, safer, more sustainable place if we could infuse finance, business and politics with more gender balance; and (3) it&#39;s easier to change things from the inside.</p><p>True to this philosophy, T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir co-founded Audur Capital in 2008, the world&#39;s first investment firm based on &quot;feminine values.&quot;&nbsp;Audur was one of few financial companies in Iceland to survive the crash. T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir has since been an active change catalyst, advocating for principle-based leadership and more women around decision-making tables.</p><p>In 2016, responding to popular demand (and a viral Facebook campaign), T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir ran for president of Iceland. A woman in a man&#39;s race. Polls initially put T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir as an outsider, predicting 1 percent of the vote. A few weeks later, against all odds, T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir came in second supported by 28 percent of Icelanders.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/halla_tomasdottir_it_s_time_for_women_to_run_for_office","viewed_count":935036,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"Halla Tómasdóttir recommends","blurb":"Check out these resources on leadership and being your authentic self, curated by Halla Tómasdóttir.","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":null,"type":"recommendation","rec_lists":[{"title":"Leadership and gender","description":"There are endless books on leadership, but here are a few that specifically touch upon the issues of gender and/or gendered values.

She was the most sincere-looking human being I have ever seen, a living emoji of sincerity: her head gently tilted to one side, her face a perfect equation of warm smile and worried, caring expression.

She infused the world of finance with “feminine values,\" which helped her survive the financial meltdown in Iceland and nearly made her president.","whylisten":"<p>T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir&#39;s philosophy is simple: (1) the challenges we&#39;re facing today won&#39;t be solved by testosterone alone; (2) the world would be a better, safer, more sustainable place if we could infuse finance, business and politics with more gender balance; and (3) it&#39;s easier to change things from the inside.</p><p>True to this philosophy, T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir co-founded Audur Capital in 2008, the world&#39;s first investment firm based on &quot;feminine values.&quot;&nbsp;Audur was one of few financial companies in Iceland to survive the crash. T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir has since been an active change catalyst, advocating for principle-based leadership and more women around decision-making tables.</p><p>In 2016, responding to popular demand (and a viral Facebook campaign), T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir ran for president of Iceland. A woman in a man&#39;s race. Polls initially put T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir as an outsider, predicting 1 percent of the vote. A few weeks later, against all odds, T&oacute;masd&oacute;ttir came in second supported by 28 percent of Icelanders.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Halla Tómasdóttir","tags":["culture","democracy","gender equality","government","motivation","politics","inequality","social change","media","television","women"],"title":"It's time for women to run for office","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":935036}]}
