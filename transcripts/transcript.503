											These are grim economic times,
											fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.
											And so, I would like to cheer you up
											with one of the great, albeit largely unknown,
											commercial success stories
											of the past 20 years.
											Comparable, in its own very peculiar way,
											to the achievements of Microsoft or Google.
											And it&#39;s an industry which has bucked the current recession
											with equanimity.
											I refer to organized crime.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now organized crime has been around
											for a very long time, I hear you say,
											and these would be wise words, indeed.
											But in the last two decades,
											it has experienced an unprecedented expansion,
											now accounting for roughly 15 percent
											of the world&#39;s GDP.
											I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy,
											or McMafia, for short.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what triggered this extraordinary growth
											in cross-border crime?
											Well, of course, there is globalization,
											technology, communications, all that stuff,
											which we&#39;ll talk about a little bit later.
											But first, I would like to take you back
											to this event:
											the collapse of communism.
											All across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode
											in our post-war history.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now it&#39;s time for full disclosure.
											This event meant a great deal to me personally.
											I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain
											to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe,
											like Solidarity in Poland,
											when I was in my teens.
											I then started writing about Eastern Europe,
											and eventually I became the BBC&#39;s chief correspondent for the region,
											which is what I was doing in 1989.
											And so when 425 million people
											finally won the right
											to choose their own governments,
											I was ecstatic,
											but I was also a touch worried
											about some of the nastier things
											lurking behind the wall.

											It wasn&#39;t long, for example,
											before ethnic nationalism
											reared its bloody head
											in Yugoslavia.
											And amongst the chaos,
											amidst the euphoria,
											it took me a little while to understand
											that some of the people who had wielded power
											before 1989, in Eastern Europe,
											continued to do so after the revolutions there.
											Obviously there were characters like this.
											But there were also some more unexpected people
											who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe.

											Like this character. Remember these guys?
											They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting
											and wrestling, every four years in the Olympics,
											and they were the great celebrities of communism,
											with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.
											They used to get great apartments in the center of town,
											casual sex on tap,
											and they could travel to the West very freely,
											which was a great luxury at the time.
											It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role
											in the emergence of the market economy
											in Eastern Europe.
											Or as I like to call them, they are
											the midwives of capitalism.
											Here are some of those same weightlifters
											after their 1989 makeover.

									<p>
											Now in Bulgaria —
											this photograph was taken in Bulgaria —
											when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe,
											it wasn&#39;t just communism;
											it was the state that collapsed as well.
											That means your police force wasn&#39;t working.
											The court system wasn&#39;t functioning properly.
											So what was a business man in the brave new world
											of East European capitalism going to do
											to make sure that his contracts would be honored?
											Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically
											by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.
											We prefer to know them as the mafia.
											And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined
											with 14,000 people
											who were sacked from their jobs in the security services
											between 1989 and 1991.

											It&#39;s not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers,

											made the trip across the Adriatic,

											And it has no rules to its regulatory system.

											Hooked it up to my laptop,

Whether it&#39;s pot smugglers in British Columbia, oil/weapons/people traffickers in Eastern Europe, Japanese yakuza or Nigerian scammers, to research this magisterial work Glenny penetrated the convoluted, globalized and franchised modern underworld -- often at considerable personal risk. <br /><br />The book that resulted is an exhaustive look at an unseen industry that Glenny believes may account for 15% of the world&#39;s GDP. <br /><br />Legal society ignores this world at its peril, but Glenny suggests that conventional law enforcement might not be able to combat a problem whose roots lie in global instability. <br /><br />While covering the Central Europe beat for the <em>Guardian</em> and the BBC, Glenny wrote several acclaimed books on the fall of Yugoslavia and the rise of the Balkan nations. He&#39;s researching a new book on cybercrime, of which he says: &quot;The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering. Or to use the technical term for it, there&#39;s one born every minute.&quot;</p><p>Watch TED&#39;s exclusive video Q&amp;A with Glenny: <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2010/03/31/behind_the_scen_2/\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Behind the Scenes of McMafia&quot; &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Misha Glenny","tags":["adventure","crime","economics","global issues","writing","narcotics","journalism"],"title":"The real story of McMafia -- how global crime networks work","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":952727}]}
