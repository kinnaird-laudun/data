											This is Shivdutt Yadav,
											and he&#39;s from Uttar Pradesh, India.
											Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office
											in Uttar Pradesh,
											and he discovered
											that official records were listing him as dead.
											His land was no longer registered
											in his name.
											His brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand,
											were also listed as dead.

											Family members had bribed officials
											to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land
											by having the brothers declared dead,
											allowing them to inherit
											their father&#39;s share of the ancestral farmland.
											Because of this, all three brothers and their families
											had to vacate their home.
											According to the Yadav family,
											the local court has been scheduling a case review
											since 2001,
											but a judge has never appeared.

											There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh
											of people dying
											before their case is given a proper review.
											Shivdutt&#39;s father&#39;s death and a want for his property
											led to this corruption.
											He was laid to rest in the Ganges River,
											where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river
											or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water.

											Photographing these brothers
											was a disorienting exchange
											because on paper they don&#39;t exist,
											and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life.
											Yet, these men remain dead.
											This quandary led to the title of the project,
											which considers in many ways
											that we are all the living dead
											and that we in some ways represent
											ghosts of the past and the future.

											So this story is the first of 18 chapters
											in my new body of work titled &quot;A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters.&quot;
											And for this work,
											I traveled around the world over a four-year period
											researching and recording bloodlines
											and their related stories.
											I was interested in ideas surrounding fate
											and whether our fate is determined
											by blood, chance or circumstance.
											The subjects I documented
											ranged from feuding families in Brazil
											to victims of genocide in Bosnia
											to the first woman to hijack an airplane
											and the living dead in India.
											In each chapter, you can see the external forces
											of governance, power and territory or religion
											colliding with the internal forces
											of psychological and physical inheritance.

											Each work that I make
											is comprised of three segments.
											On the left are one or more portrait panels
											in which I systematically order
											the members of a given bloodline.
											This is followed by a text panel, it&#39;s designed in scroll form,
											in which I construct
											the narrative at stake.
											And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.
											It&#39;s a space that&#39;s more intuitive
											in which I present fragments of the story,
											beginnings of other stories, photographic evidence.
											And it&#39;s meant to kind of reflect
											how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet,
											in a less linear form.
											So it&#39;s more disordered.
											And this disorder is in direct contrast
											to the unalterable order of a bloodline.

											In my past projects I&#39;ve often worked in serial form,
											documenting things that have
											the appearance of being comprehensive
											through a determined title and a determined presentation,
											but in fact, are fairly abstract.
											In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction
											and find an absolute catalog,
											something that I couldn&#39;t interrupt, curate or edit by choice.
											This led me to blood.
											A bloodline is determined and ordered.
											But the project centers
											on the collision of order and disorder —
											the order of blood butting up against the disorder
											represented in the often chaotic and violent stories
											that are the subjects of my chapters.

											In chapter two, I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin.
											He was sent in 1907 to Palestine
											by the Zionist organization
											to look at areas for Jewish settlement
											and acquire land for Jewish settlement.
											He oversaw land acquisition
											on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company
											whose work led to the establishment
											of a Jewish state.
											Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem,
											I wanted to look at the early paperwork
											of the establishment of the Jewish state.
											And I found these maps which you see here.
											And these are studies

											Chapter three:
											Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo
											treated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya
											for AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility,
											mental illness, evil spirits.
											He&#39;s most often paid for his services

											But sometimes when his female patients

											their families give the women to Jura
											in exchange for medical treatment.

											Twenty-four European rabbits

											for sporting purposes, for hunting.
											And within a hundred years,
											that population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.
											The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia,
											and it competes with native wildlife
											and damages native plants
											and degrades the land.
											Since the 1950s,
											Australia has been introducing lethal diseases
											into the wild rabbit population
											to control growth.
											These rabbits were bred at a government facility,
											Biosecurity Queensland,
											where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits
											and have infected them with a lethal disease
											and are monitoring their progress
											to see if it will effectively kill them.
											So they&#39;re testing its virulence.
											During the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died,

											Chapter 12 highlights

											So this is the Ferraz family
											and the Novaes family.

											This feud has been going on since 1991

											Chapter 17

											Children at this Ukrainian orphanage
											are between the ages of six and 16.
											This piece is ordered by age
											because it can&#39;t be ordered by blood.
											In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage,
											only one child had been adopted.
											Children have to leave the orphanage at age 16,
											despite the fact that there&#39;s often nowhere for them to go.
											It&#39;s commonly reported in Ukraine
											that children, when leaving the orphanage
											are targeted for human trafficking,
											child pornography and prostitution.
											Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival,

											There are many more chapters in this project.
											This is just an abridged rendering
											of over a thousand images.
											And this mass pile of images and stories
											forms an archive.
											And within this accumulation of images and texts,
											I&#39;m struggling to find patterns
											and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead
											are just as coded as blood itself.
											But archives exist
											because there&#39;s something that can&#39;t necessarily be articulated.
											Something is said in the gaps
											between all the information that&#39;s collected.
											And there&#39;s this relentless persistence
											of birth and death
											and an unending collection of stories in between.
											It&#39;s almost machine-like
											the way people are born and people die,

Democracy needs visibility, accountability, light ... Somehow, Simon has persuaded a good few denizens of hidden world not to scurry for shelter when the light is switched on, as cockroaches and vampires do, but to pose proudly for her invading lens ...","whotheyare":"With a large-format camera and a knack for talking her way into forbidden zones, Taryn Simon photographs portions of the American infrastructure inaccessible to its inhabitants.","whylisten":"<p>Taryn Simon is a multidisciplinary artist working in photography, text, sculpture and performance. Guided by an interest in systems of categorization and classification, her practice involves extensive research into the power and structure of secrecy and the precarious nature of survival. Her works have been the subject of exhibitions at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Copenhagen (2016-17); The Albertinum, Dresden (2016); Galerie Rudolfinum, Prague (2016); Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow (2016); Jeu de Paume, Paris (2015); Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing (2013); Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012); Tate Modern, London (2011); Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (2011); and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2007).&nbsp;</p><p>In<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://geni.us/americanindex\" target=\"_blank\"><em>An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar</em></a>, Simon compiles an inventory of what lies hidden and out-of-view within the borders of the United States. She examines a culture through documentation of subjects from domains including: science, government, medicine, entertainment, nature, security and religion. Confronting the divide between those with and without the privilege of access, her collection reflects and reveals that which is integral to America&rsquo;s foundation, mythology and daily functioning.&nbsp;</p><p><a style=\"font-style: italic\" href=\"http://geni.us/alivingman\" target=\"_blank\">A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters&nbsp;I-XVIII</a><em>&nbsp;</em>was produced over a four-year period (2008&ndash;11) during which Simon traveled around the world researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories. In each of the eighteen &quot;chapters&quot; comprising the work, the external forces of territory, power, circumstance or religion collide with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance. The subjects documented by Simon include victims of genocide in Bosnia, test rabbits infected with a lethal disease in Australia, the first woman to hijack an aircraft, and the living dead in India. Her collection is at once cohesive and arbitrary, mapping the relationships among chance, blood and other components of fate.</p><p>Permanent collections include Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Tate Modern, London; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles. Her work was included in the 56th Venice Biennale (2015). Simon&#39;s installation, <em>An Occupation of Loss</em> (2016), co-commissioned by the Park Avenue Armory and Artangel, premiered in New York in 2016. The performance will be held again in London in 2018. Simon is a graduate of Brown University and a Guggenheim Fellow. She lives and works in New York.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Taryn Simon","tags":["art","culture","global issues","photography"],"title":"The stories behind the bloodlines","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":793407}]}
