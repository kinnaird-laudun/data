<meta content="Global problems such as terrorism, inequality and political dysfunction aren't easy to solve, but that doesn't mean we should stop trying. In fact, suggests journalist Jonathan Tepperman, we might even want to think riskier. He traveled the world to ask global leaders how they're tackling hard problems — and unearthed surprisingly hopeful stories that he's distilled into three tools for problem-solving." itemprop='description'>

											The conventional wisdom
about our world today
											is that this is a time
of terrible decline.
											And that&#39;s not surprising,
given the bad news all around us,
											from ISIS to inequality,
											political dysfunction, climate change,
											Brexit, and on and on.
											But here&#39;s the thing,
and this may sound a little weird.
											I actually don&#39;t buy
this gloomy narrative,
											and I don&#39;t think you should either.
											Look, it&#39;s not that
I don&#39;t see the problems.
											I read the same headlines that you do.
											What I dispute is the conclusion
that so many people draw from them,
											namely that we&#39;re all screwed
											because the problems are unsolvable
											and our governments are useless.

											Now, why do I say this?
											It&#39;s not like I&#39;m particularly
optimistic by nature.
											But something about the media&#39;s
constant doom-mongering
											with its fixation on problems
and not on answers
											has always really bugged me.

											So a few years ago I decided,
											well, I&#39;m a journalist,
											I should see if I can do any better
											by going around the world
and actually asking folks
											if and how they&#39;ve tackled
											their big economic
and political challenges.
											And what I found astonished me.
											It turns out that there are remarkable
signs of progress out there,
											often in the most unexpected places,
											and they&#39;ve convinced me
that our great global challenges
											may not be so unsolvable after all.
											Not only are there theoretical fixes;
											those fixes have been tried.
											They&#39;ve worked.
											And they offer hope for the rest of us.

how three of the countries I visited —

tools the rest of us can use,

particular problems,

about my homeland, Canada, today,

											But Canada&#39;s also important
											because of its triumph over a problem
											currently tearing
many other countries apart:
											immigration.
											Consider, Canada today is among
the world&#39;s most welcoming nations,
											even compared to other
immigration-friendly countries.
											Its per capita immigration rate
is four times higher than France&#39;s,
											and its percentage
of foreign-born residents

											Now, here&#39;s the really interesting part.
											Canada wasn&#39;t always like this.
											Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed
an explicitly racist immigration policy.
											They called it &quot;White Canada,&quot;
											and as you can see, they were not
just talking about the snow.

											So how did that Canada
become today&#39;s Canada?
											Well, despite what my mom
in Ontario will tell you,
											the answer had nothing to do with virtue.
											Canadians are not inherently
better than anyone else.
											The real explanation involves the man
who became Canada&#39;s leader in 1968,
											Pierre Trudeau, who is also
the father of the current prime minister.

											The thing to know about that first Trudeau
											is that he was very different
from Canada&#39;s previous leaders.

long-dominated by its English elite.

											He was even kind of groovy.

									<p>
											And like all hipsters,
he could be infuriating at times.
											But he nevertheless pulled off
											one of the most progressive
transformations any country has ever seen.
											His formula, I&#39;ve learned,
involved two parts.
											First, Canada threw out
its old race-based immigration rules,
											and it replaced them
with new color-blind ones
											that emphasized education,
experience and language skills instead.
											And what that did
was greatly increase the odds
											that newcomers would
contribute to the economy.
											Then part two, Trudeau
created the world&#39;s first policy
											of official multiculturalism
to promote integration
											and the idea that diversity
was the key to Canada&#39;s identity.

											Now, in the years that followed,
Ottawa kept pushing this message,

											Let&#39;s now turn to another country
and an even tougher problem,
											Islamic extremism.
											In 1998, the people of Indonesia
took to the streets
											and overthrew
their longtime dictator, Suharto.
											It was an amazing moment,
											but it was also a scary one.
											With 250 million people,
											Indonesia is the largest
Muslim-majority country on Earth.
											It&#39;s also hot, huge and unruly,
											made up of 17,000 islands,
											where people speak
close to a thousand languages.
											Now, Suharto had been a dictator,
											and a nasty one.
											But he&#39;d also been
a pretty effective tyrant,
											and he&#39;d always been careful
to keep religion out of politics.
											So experts feared that without
him keeping a lid on things,
											the country would explode,
											or religious extremists would take over
											and turn Indonesia
into a tropical version of Iran.
											And that&#39;s just what seemed
to happen at first.
											In the country&#39;s
first free elections, in 1999,
											Islamist parties scored
36 percent of the vote,
											and the islands burned
											as riots and terror attacks
killed thousands.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Since then, however,
Indonesia has taken a surprising turn.
											While ordinary folks have grown
more pious on a personal level —
											I saw a lot more headscarves
on a recent visit
											than I would have a decade ago —
											the country&#39;s politics
have moved in the opposite direction.
											Indonesia is now
a pretty decent democracy.
											And yet, its Islamist parties
have steadily lost support,
											from a high of about 38 percent in 2004
											down to 25 percent in 2014.
											As for terrorism, it&#39;s now extremely rare.
											And while a few Indonesians
have recently joined ISIS,
											their number is tiny,
											far fewer in per capita terms
											than the number of Belgians.
											Try to think of one other
Muslim-majority country
											that can say all those same things.

											See, Indonesia&#39;s religious parties,
like similar parties elsewhere,
											had tended to focus on things like
reducing poverty and cutting corruption.
											So that&#39;s what Joko
and his predecessors did too,
											thereby stealing the Islamists&#39; thunder.
											They also cracked down hard on terrorism,
											but Indonesia&#39;s democrats
have learned a key lesson
											from the dark years of dictatorship,
											namely that repression
only creates more extremism.
											So they waged their war
with extraordinary delicacy.
											They used the police instead of the army.
											They only detained suspects
if they had enough evidence.
											They held public trials.
											They even sent
liberal imams into the jails
											to persuade the jihadists
that terror is un-Islamic.
											And all of this paid off
in spectacular fashion,
											creating the kind of country
that was unimaginable 20 years ago.

											So at this point,
my optimism should, I hope,
											be starting to make a bit more sense.
											Neither immigration nor Islamic extremism
are impossible to deal with.
											Join me now on one last trip,
											this time to Mexico.
											Now, of our three stories,
this one probably surprised me the most,
											since as you all know,
											the country is still struggling
with so many problems.
											And yet, a few years ago,
Mexico did something
											that many other countries
from France to India to the United States

											To understand how,
we need to rewind to the year 2000,
											when Mexico finally became a democracy.
											Rather than use their new freedoms
to fight for reform,
											Mexico&#39;s politicians used them
to fight one another.
											Congress deadlocked,
and the country&#39;s problems —
											drugs, poverty, crime, corruption —
											spun out of control.
											Things got so bad that in 2008,
											the Pentagon warned
that Mexico risked collapse.

											Then in 2012, this guy
named Enrique Peña Nieto
											somehow got himself elected president.
											Now, this Peña hardly inspired
much confidence at first.
											Sure, he was handsome,
											but he came from Mexico&#39;s
corrupt old ruling party, the PRI,
											and he was a notorious womanizer.
											In fact, he seemed
like such a pretty boy lightweight
											that women called him &quot;bombón,&quot; sweetie,
											at campaign rallies.
											And yet this same bombón
soon surprised everyone
											by hammering out a truce
											between the country&#39;s
three warring political parties.
											And over the next 18 months,
they together passed
											an incredibly comprehensive
set of reforms.
											They busted open Mexico&#39;s
smothering monopolies.
											They liberalized
its rusting energy sector.
											They restructured
its failing schools, and much more.
											To appreciate the scale
of this accomplishment,
											try to imagine the US Congress
passing immigration reform,
											campaign finance reform
and banking reform.
											Now, try to imagine Congress
doing it all at the same time.

was &quot;compromiso,&quot; compromise.
											Of course, I pushed him for details,
											and the long answer
that came out was essentially
											&quot;compromise, compromise
and more compromise.&quot;
											See, Peña knew that he needed
to build trust early,
											so he started talking to the opposition
just days after his election.
											To ward off pressure
from special interests,
											he kept their meetings small and secret,
											and many of the participants
later told me that it was this intimacy,

											Number one, embrace the extreme.
											In all the stories we&#39;ve just looked at,
											salvation came at a moment
of existential peril.
											And that was no coincidence.
											Take Canada: when Trudeau took office,
he faced two looming dangers.
											First, though his vast,
underpopulated country
											badly needed more bodies,
											its preferred source
for white workers, Europe,
											had just stopped exporting them
as it finally recovered from World War II.
											The other problem was
that Canada&#39;s long cold war
											between its French
and its English communities
											had just become a hot one.
											Quebec was threatening to secede,
											and Canadians were actually
killing other Canadians over politics.
											Now, countries face
crises all the time. Right?
											That&#39;s nothing special.
											But Trudeau&#39;s genius
was to realize that Canada&#39;s crisis
											had swept away all the hurdles
that usually block reform.
											Canada had to open up. It had no choice.
											And it had to rethink its identity.
											Again, it had no choice.
											And that gave Trudeau
a once-in-a-generation opportunity
											to break the old rules and write new ones.
											And like all our other heroes,
he was smart enough to seize it.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Number two, there&#39;s power
in promiscuous thinking.
											Another striking similarity
among good problem-solvers
											is that they&#39;re all pragmatists.
											They&#39;ll steal the best answers
from wherever they find them,
											and they don&#39;t let details
											like party or ideology
or sentimentality get in their way.
											As I mentioned earlier,
Indonesia&#39;s democrats were clever enough
											to steal many of the Islamists&#39;
best campaign promises for themselves.
											They even invited some of the radicals
into their governing coalition.
											Now, that horrified
a lot of secular Indonesians.
											But by forcing the radicals
to actually help govern,
											it quickly exposed the fact
that they weren&#39;t any good at the job,
											and it got them mixed up
in all of the grubby compromises
											and petty humiliations
that are part of everyday politics.
											And that hurt their image so badly
that they&#39;ve never recovered.

											Number three,
											please all of the people some of the time.
											I know I just mentioned how crises
can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms.
											And that&#39;s true, but problem-solving
often requires more than just boldness.
											It takes showing restraint, too,
											just when that&#39;s
the last thing you want to do.
											Take Trudeau: when he took office,
											he could easily have put
his core constituency,
											that is Canada&#39;s French community, first.
											He could have pleased
some of the people all of the time.
											And Peña could have used his power
to keep attacking the opposition,
											as was traditional in Mexico.
											Yet he chose to embrace
his enemies instead,
											while forcing his own party to compromise.
											And Trudeau pushed everyone
to stop thinking in tribal terms
											and to see multiculturalism,
not language and not skin color,
											as what made them
quintessentially Canadian.
											Nobody got everything they wanted,
											but everyone got just enough
that the bargains held.

											So at this point you may be thinking,
											&quot;OK, Tepperman,
											if the fixes really are out there

											then why aren&#39;t more countries
already using them?&quot;
											It&#39;s not like they require
special powers to pull off.
											I mean, none of the leaders
we&#39;ve just looked at were superheroes.
											They didn&#39;t accomplish
anything on their own,
											and they all had plenty of flaws.

											So what this tells us
is that the real obstacle is not ability,
