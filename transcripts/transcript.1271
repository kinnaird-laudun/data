											Hi. So I&#39;d like to talk a little bit about the people
											who make the things we use every day:
											our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.
											Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.
											Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than
											a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes,
											or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop
											after working overtime assembling your iPad.
											We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit
											these victims with every purchase we make,
											and the injustice
											feels embedded in the products themselves.
											After all, what&#39;s wrong with a world in which a worker
											on an iPhone assembly line can&#39;t even afford to buy one?
											It&#39;s taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive,
											and that it&#39;s our desire for cheap goods
											that makes them so.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, this simple narrative equating Western demand
											and Chinese suffering is appealing,
											especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty
											about our impact on the world,
											but it&#39;s also inaccurate and disrespectful.
											We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we
											have the power to drive tens of millions of people
											on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer
											in such terrible ways.
											In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world,
											including its own, thanks to a combination of factors:
											its low costs, its large and educated workforce,
											and a flexible manufacturing system
											that responds quickly to market demands.
											By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets,
											we have rendered the individuals on the other end
											into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable
											as the parts of a mobile phone.

											Chinese workers are not forced into factories
											because of our insatiable desire for iPods.

											been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.

											So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers
											like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.
											Certain subjects came up over and over:
											how much money they made,
											what kind of husband they hoped to marry,
											whether they should jump to another factory
											or stay where they were.
											Other subjects came up almost never, including
											living conditions that to me looked close to prison life:
											10 or 15 workers in one room,
											50 people sharing a single bathroom,
											days and nights ruled by the factory clock.
											Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances,
											and it was still better than the dormitories and homes
											of rural China.

											The workers rarely spoke about the products they made,
											and they often had great difficulty explaining
											what exactly they did.
											When I asked Lu Qingmin,
											the young woman I got to know best,
											what exactly she did on the factory floor,
											she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like
											&quot;qiu xi.&quot;
											Only much later did I realize that she had been saying
											&quot;QC,&quot; or quality control.
											She couldn&#39;t even tell me what she did on the factory floor.
											All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation
											in a language she didn&#39;t even understand.

											Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism,
											the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.
											Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets,
											the worker in an industrial factory has no control,
											no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding
											in her own work.
											But like so many theories that Marx arrived at
											sitting in the reading room of the British Museum,
											he got this one wrong.
											Just because a person spends her time
											making a piece of something does not mean
											that she becomes that, a piece of something.
											What she does with the money she earns,
											what she learns in that place, and how it changes her,
											these are the things that matter.
											What a factory makes is never the point, and
											the workers could not care less who buys their products.

											Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories,
											on the other hand, plays up this relationship
											between the workers and the products they make.
											Many articles calculate: How long would it take
											for this worker to work in order to earn enough money
											to buy what he&#39;s making?
											For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker
											in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out
											two and a half months&#39; wages for an iPhone.

											But how meaningful is this calculation, really?
											For example, I recently wrote an article
											in The New Yorker magazine,
											but I can&#39;t afford to buy an ad in it.
											But, who cares? I don&#39;t want an ad in The New Yorker,
											and most of these workers don&#39;t really want iPhones.
											Their calculations are different.
											How long should I stay in this factory?
											How much money can I save?
											How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car,
											to get married, or to put my child through school?

											The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract
											relationship with the product of their labor.
											About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min,
											she invited me home to her family village
											for the Chinese New Year.
											On the train home, she gave me a present:
											a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.
											I thanked her, assuming it was fake,
											like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.
											After we got home, Min gave her mother another present:
											a pink Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag,
											and a few nights later, her sister was showing off
											a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.
											Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags
											were made by their factory,
											and every single one of them was authentic.

											In Min&#39;s world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.

											close to the actual value, because almost no one they knew

											Once, when Min&#39;s older sister&#39;s friend got married,

											I looked in the zippered pocket of one,

											In 1941, the burnished patina
											of an all-American baseball glove
											inspired the founder of Coach to create
											a new collection of handbags from the same
											luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.
											Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags

											Across China, there are 150 million workers like her,

											LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers
											is how much they&#39;re self-motivated, self-driven,
											resourceful, and the thing that struck me,
											what they want most is education, to learn,
											because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.
											They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.
											Their parents are often illiterate,
											and then they come to the city, and they, on their own,
											at night, during the weekends, they&#39;ll take a computer class,
											they&#39;ll take an English class, and learn
											really, really rudimentary things, you know,
											like how to type a document in Word,
											or how to say really simple things in English.
											So, if you really want to help these workers,
											start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes
											in these schools, and what&#39;s going to happen is,
											all your workers are going to move on,
											but hopefully they&#39;ll move on into higher jobs within Apple,
											and you can help their social mobility
											and their self-improvement.
											When you talk to workers, that&#39;s what they want.
											They do not say, &quot;I want better hot water in the showers.
											I want a nicer room. I want a TV set.&quot;
											I mean, it would be nice to have those things,

											LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know,
											it was interesting, because I spent basically two years
											hanging out in this city, Dongguan,
											and over that time, you could see immense change
											in every person&#39;s life: upward, downward, sideways,
											but generally upward.
											If you spend enough time, it&#39;s upward, and I met people
											who had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now
											basically urban middle class people,
											so the trajectory is definitely upward.
											It&#39;s just hard to see when you&#39;re suddenly
											sucked into the city. It looks like everyone&#39;s poor and
											desperate, but that&#39;s not really how it is.
											Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough,

											but from their perspective, where they&#39;re coming from
											is much worse, and where they&#39;re going
											is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give
											that context of what&#39;s going on in their minds,
											not what necessarily is going on in yours.
