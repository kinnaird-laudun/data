											Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question
											I know that&#39;s been pressing on many of your minds.
											We spoke to you last several years ago.
											And before I get started today,

											I just wanted to get it out of the way.
											The answer is boxers.

											SB: Wow, OK. I didn&#39;t really realize what it was when I first saw it.
											But this is what helped me see it.
											This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.
											Here it&#39;s slightly logged.
											But here you can see around the world
											how people are using Google.
											And every one of those rising dots
											represents probably about 20, 30 searches,
											or something like that.
											And they&#39;re labeled by color right now, by language.

											So you can see: here we are in the U.S.,
											and they&#39;re all coming up red.
											There we are in Monterey — hopefully I can get it right.
											You can see that Japan is busy at night,
											right there.
											We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.
											There&#39;s a lot of activity in China.
											There&#39;s a lot of activity in India.
											There&#39;s some in the Middle East, the little pockets.
											And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,
											is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.

											Now you can also see, if I turn this around here —
											hopefully I won&#39;t shake the world too much.
											But you can also see, there are places where there&#39;s not so much.
											Australia, because there just aren&#39;t very many people there.
											And this is something that we should really work on,
											which is Africa, which is just a few trickles,
											basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.
											But basically, what we&#39;ve noticed is these queries,
											which come in at thousands per second,
											are available everywhere there is power.
											And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.
											And even in Antarctica — well, at least this time of year —
											we from time to time will see a query rising up.
											And if we had it plotted correctly,
											I think the International Space Station would have it, too.

											So this is
											some of the challenge that we have here,
											is you can see that it&#39;s actually kind of hard to get the —
											there we go.
											This is how we have to move the bits around
											to actually get the people the answers to their questions.
											You can see that there&#39;s a lot of data running around.
											It has to go all over the world: through fibers,
											through satellites, through all kinds of connections.
											And it&#39;s pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies
											as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.

											Now what I would like to do is just to show you

											Now, each one of those queries
											has an interesting life and tale of its own.
											I mean, it could be somebody&#39;s health,

											So this is a query that we had —
											I guess it&#39;s a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.
											You can see that it got started right here.
											In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.
											But it didn&#39;t have quite the same pickup in the U.S.
											as it did in Spain.
											And then from Spain, it went to Italy,
											and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.
											And so I guess the U.S. finally,

											As a part of —

											is to have more searches.
											And what that means is we want to have
											more people who are healthy and educated.
											More animals, if they start doing searches as well.
											But partly, we want to make the world a better place,

											we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,

											Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey.
											So one of the things — both Sergey and I
											went to a Montessori school,
											and I think, for some reason,
											this has been incorporated in Google.
											And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,
											you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,
											and we call this — at Google, we&#39;ve embodied this as &quot;the 20 percent time,&quot;
											and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,
											if you&#39;re working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.
											And many, many things at Google have come out of that,
											such as Orkut and also Google News.
											And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.
											Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,
											actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics —
											as a hobby, basically.
											So many, many useful things come out of this.

											And News, which I just mentioned,

											And he just — he — after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.
											And he said, &quot;Why don&#39;t I look at the news better?&quot;
											And so he started clustering it by category,
											and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.
											And then, besides just looking cute on a baby&#39;s bottom,

											So it&#39;d be like three people, or something like that,
											and they would try to make a product.
											And we wouldn&#39;t really be sure if it&#39;s going to work or not.
											And in News&#39; case, you know, they had a couple of people
											working on it for a while, and then more and more people
											started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,
											and more and more people started using it.
											And now it&#39;s a real, full-blown project with more people on it.

											I think usually, as companies get bigger,

											And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,
											&quot;Oh, we really need a new concept.&quot;
											You know, the Googlettes — that&#39;s a small project that we&#39;re not quite sure if it&#39;s going to work or not,

											But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.
											And I don&#39;t know about all of you,
											but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.
											And we found that if we just wrote all of them down
											and ordered them — and these are kind of made up.
											Don&#39;t really pay attention to them.
											For example, the &quot;Buy Iceland&quot; was from a media article.
											We would never do such a crazy thing, but —
											in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,
											that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.
											And this was kind of a surprise to me, but
											we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,
											which you did by writing them down,
											that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do
											and where to put your resources.
											And so that&#39;s basically what we&#39;ve done
											since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative

											I just wanted to highlight a couple of things

											And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it&#39;s just present all the time
											on your screen on the bottom,
											and you can do searches really easily.
											And it&#39;s sort of like a better version of the toolbar.

											This is another example of a project that somebody at Google
											was really passionate about, and they just, they got going,
											and it&#39;s really, really a great product, and really taking off.
											Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool,
											which lets you — for five to 100 dollars,
											you can type a question in,
											and then there&#39;s a pool of researchers
											that go out and research it for you, and it&#39;s guaranteed and all that,

											Froogle lets you search shopping information,
											and Blogger lets you publish things.
											But all of these — well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that —
											you know, we try many, many different things
											in our company.
											We also like to innovate in our physical space,
											and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time
											for projectors to turn on and off,
											and they&#39;re noisy, so people shut them off.
											And we didn&#39;t like that, so we actually,
											in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures
											that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time
											and they&#39;re completely silent.
											And as a result, we were able to build some software
											that also lets us manage a meeting,
											so when you walk into a meeting room now,
											it lists all the meetings that are happening,
											you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically

											We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,

											to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...

											One of the things that really excites me about what we&#39;re doing now
											is we have this thing called AdSense,
											and this is a little bit foreshadowing —
											this is from before Dean dropped out.
											But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,
											we show you relevant ads.
											And this is hard to read, but this says &quot;Battle for New Hampshire:
											Howard Dean for President&quot; — articles on Howard Dean.
											And these ads are generated automatically —
											like in this case, on the Washington Post —
											from the content on the site.
											And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers
											and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one
											that&#39;s most relevant to what you&#39;re actually looking at,
											much as we do on search.

											So this session is supposed to be about the future,
											so I&#39;d thought I&#39;d talk at least briefly about it.
											And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,
											you really have to be smart.
											Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,
											and you expect an answer back, right?
											But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.
											And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.
											It would be artificial intelligence.
											And so that&#39;s something we work on,
											and we even have some people who are excited enough
											and crazy enough to work on it now,
											and that&#39;s really their goal.
											So we always hope that Google will be smart,

											And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.
											This is a blog from Iraq,
											and it&#39;s not really what
											I&#39;m going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.

											So, &quot;related searches,&quot; right there. You can&#39;t see it that well,

											into our AdSense ads, called &quot;related searches.&quot;
											And so we&#39;d say, you know, &quot;Did you mean &#39;search for&#39;&quot; — what is this,
											in this case, &quot;Saddam Hussein,&quot; because this blog is about Iraq —

											And so there is this blog
											of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,
											&quot;You know, I&#39;m sleeping a lot.&quot;
											He was just kind of writing about his life.
											And our algorithms — not a person, of course,
											but our algorithms, our computers —
											read his blog and decided that
											the related search was, &quot;I am bored.&quot;
											And he read this, and he thought a person had decided
											that he was boring,
											and it was very unfortunate,
											and he said, &quot;You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?
											Why don&#39;t they like my blog?&quot;
											And so then we read his blog, which was getting — you know,
											sort of going from bad to worse,
											and we said the related search was, &quot;Retards.&quot;
											And then, you know, he got even more mad,
											and he wrote — like, started swearing and so on.
											And then we produced &quot;You suck.&quot;
											And finally, it ended with &quot;Kiss my ass.&quot;
											And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,
											and of course, you know,

											So with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.
											I wanted to end just by saying that
											there&#39;s a couple things that really make me excited
											to be involved with Google,
											and one of those is that we&#39;re able to make money
											largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn&#39;t expect from that
											was that we&#39;re able to serve everyone in the world
											without worrying about, you know, places that don&#39;t have as much money.
											So we don&#39;t have to worry about our products being sold,
											for example, for less money in places that are poor,
											and then they get re-imported into the U.S. —
											for example, with the drug industry.

											And I think we&#39;re really lucky to have that kind of business model
											because everyone in the world has access to our search,
											and I think that&#39;s a tremendous, tremendous benefit.
											The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly
											is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility
