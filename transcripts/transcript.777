											Mountain biking in Israel
											is something that I do with great passion
											and commitment.
											And when I&#39;m on my bike,
											I feel that I connect
											with the profound beauty of Israel,
											and I feel that I&#39;m united
											with this country&#39;s history
											and biblical law.
											And also, for me,
											biking is a matter of empowerment.
											When I reach the summit
											of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,
											I feel young,
											invincible, eternal.
											It&#39;s as if I&#39;m connecting with some legacy
											or with some energy
											far greater than myself.
											You can see my fellow riders
											at the end of the picture,
											looking at me with some concern.
											And here is another picture of them.
											Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces,
											neither can I disclose their true names,
											and that&#39;s because my fellow riders
											are juvenile inmates,
											offenders
											spending time in a correction facility
											about 20 minutes&#39; ride from here —
											well, like everything in Israel.
											And I&#39;ve been riding with these kids once a week,
											every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years
											and by now, they&#39;ve become a very big part of my life.

											This story began four years ago.
											The correction facility where they are locked up
											happens to be right in the middle
											of one of my usual trips,
											and it&#39;s surrounded by barbed wires
											and electric gates and armed guards.
											So on one of these rides,
											I talked my way into the compound
											and went to see the warden.
											I told the warden
											that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place
											and that basically I wanted to take the kids
											from here to there.
											And I told him, &quot;Let&#39;s find a way
											in which I&#39;ll be able to take out 10 kids once a week
											to ride with in the summer in the country.&quot;
											And the warden was quite amused,
											and he told me he thought that I was a nut
											and he told me,
											&quot;This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.
											They are supposed to be locked up.
											They aren&#39;t supposed to be out at large.&quot;
											And yet, we began to talk about it,
											and one thing led to another.
											And I can&#39;t see myself
											going into a state prison in New Jersey
											and making such a proposition,
											but this being Israel,
											the warden somehow made it happen.
											And so two months later,
											we found ourselves &quot;at large&quot; —
											myself,
											10 juvenile inmates
											and a wonderful fellow named Russ,
											who became a very good friend of mine
											and my partner in this project.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure
											of introducing these kids
											to the world of total freedom,
											a world consisting of magnificent vistas
											like these —
											everything you see here is obviously in Israel —
											as well as close encounters
											with all sorts of small creatures
											coming in all sorts of sizes,
											colors, shapes, forms
											and so on.
											In spite of all this splendor,
											the beginning was extremely frustrating.
											Every small obstacle,
											every slight uphill,
											would cause these fellows
											to stop in their tracks and give up.
											So we had a lot of this going on.
											I found out that they had a very hard time
											dealing with frustration and difficulties —
											not because they were physically unfit.
											But that&#39;s one reason why they ended up where they were.
											And I became increasingly more and more agitated,
											because I was there
											not only to be with them,
											but also to ride and create a team
											and I didn&#39;t know what to do.

											Now, let me give you an example.
											We&#39;re going downhill in some rocky terrain,
											and the front tire of Alex
											gets caught in one of these crevasses here.
											So he crashes down,
											and he gets slightly injured,
											but this does not prevent him from jumping up
											and then starting to jump up and down on his bike
											and curse violently.
											Then he throws his helmet in the air.
											His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.
											And then he runs to the nearest tree
											and starts to break branches and throw rocks
											and curse like I&#39;ve never heard.
											And I&#39;m just standing there,
											watching this scene
											with a complete disbelief,
											not knowing what to do.
											I&#39;m used to algorithms
											and data structures
											and super motivated students,
											and nothing in my background
											prepared me to deal
											with a raging, violent adolescent
											in the middle of nowhere.
											And you have to realize that these incidents
											did not happen in convenient locations.
											They happened in places like this,
											in the Judean Desert,
											20 kilometers away from the nearest road.
											And what you don&#39;t see in this picture
											is that somewhere between these riders there,
											there&#39;s a teenager sitting on a rock,
											saying, &quot;I&#39;m not moving from here. Forget it.
											I&#39;ve had it.&quot;
											Well, that&#39;s a problem
											because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving
											because it&#39;s getting dark soon and dangerous.

											It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.
											At the beginning, it was a disaster.
											I tried harsh words and threats
											and they took me nowhere.
											That&#39;s what they had all their lives.
											And at some point I found out,
											when a kid like this gets into a fit,
											the best thing that you can possibly do
											is stay as close as possible to this kid,
											which is difficult,
											because what you really want to do is go away.
											But that&#39;s what he had all his life,
											people walking away from him.
											So what you have to do is stay close
											and try to reach in
											and pet his shoulder
											or give him a piece of chocolate.
											So I would say, &quot;Alex, I know that it&#39;s terribly difficult.
											Why don&#39;t you rest for a few minutes
											and then we&#39;ll go on.&quot;
											&quot;Go away you maniac-psychopath.
											Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?&quot;
											And I would say, &quot;Relax, Alex.
											Here&#39;s a piece of chocolate.&quot;
											And Alex would go, &quot;Arrrrggg!&quot;
											Because you have to understand
											that on these rides we are constantly hungry —
											and after the rides also.

											And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with?
											He&#39;s a 17-year-old.
											When he was eight,
											someone put him on a boat in Odessa
											and sent him, shipped him to Israel
											on his own.
											And he ended up in south Tel Aviv
											and did not have the good luck
											to be picked up by a [unclear]
											and roamed the streets
											and became a prominent gang member.
											And he spent the last 10 years of his life
											in two places only,
											the slums and the state prison,
											where he spent the last two years
											before he ended up sitting on this rock there.
											And so this kid
											was probably abused,
											abandoned, ignored, betrayed
											by almost every adult along the way.
											So, for such a kid,
											when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him
											and doesn&#39;t walk away from him
											in any situation,
											irrespective of how he behaves,
											it&#39;s a tremendous healing experience.
											It&#39;s an act of unconditional acceptance,
											something that he never had.

											I want to say a few words about vision.
											When I started this program four years ago,
											I had this original plan
											of creating a team
											of winning underdogs.
											I had an image of Lance Armstrong
											in my mind.
											And it took me exactly two months
											of complete frustration
											to realize that this vision
											was misplaced,
											and that there was another vision
											supremely more important
											and more readily available.
											It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,
											that the purpose of these rides
											should actually be
											to expose the kids
											to one thing only: love.
											Love to the country, to the uphill
											and the downhill,
											to all the incredible creatures that surround us —
											the animals, the plants,
											the insects —
											love and respect
											to other fellow members in your team,
											in your biking team,
											and most importantly,
											love and respect to yourself,
											which is something
											that they badly miss.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Together with the kids,
											I also went through a remarkable transformation.
											Now, I come from a cutthroat world
											of science and high technology.
											I used to think that reason and logic
											and relentless drive
											were the only ways to make things happen.
											And before I worked with the kids,
											anything that I did with them,
											or anything that I did with myself,
											was supposed to be perfect,
											ideal, optimal,
											but after working with them for some time,
											I discovered the great virtues of empathy
											and flexibility
											and being able to start with some vision,
											and if the vision doesn&#39;t work, well nothing happened.
											All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,
											and come up with something that does help, that does work.
											So right now, I feel more
											like these are my principles,
											and if you don&#39;t like them,
											I have others.

									<p>
											And one of these principles
											is focus.
											Before each ride
											we sit together with the kids,
											and we give them one word
											to think about during the ride.
											You have to focus their attention on something
											because so many things happen.
											So these are words like &quot;teamwork&quot;
											or &quot;endurance&quot;
											or even complicated concepts
											like &quot;resource allocation&quot;
											or &quot;perspective,&quot; a word that they don&#39;t understand.
											You know, perspective
											is one of these critically important
											life-coping strategies
											that mountain biking can really teach you.
											I tell kids
											when they struggle through some uphill
											and feel like they cannot take it anymore,
											it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles
											and raise your head and look around
											and see how the vista around you grows.
											It literally propels you upwards.
											That&#39;s what perspective is all about.
											Or you can also look back in time
											and realize that you&#39;ve already conquered
											steeper mountains before.
											And that&#39;s how they develop self-esteem.

									<p>
											Now, let me give you an example of how it works.
											You stand with your bike at the beginning of February.
											It&#39;s very cold, and you&#39;re standing in one of these rainy days,
											and it&#39;s drizzling
											and cold and chilly,
											and you&#39;re standing in, let&#39;s say, Yokneam.
											And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds
											you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka —
											that&#39;s where you&#39;re supposed to climb now —
											and you say, &quot;There&#39;s no way that I could possibly get there.&quot;
											And yet, two hours later
											you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,
											smeared with mud,
											blood and sweat.
											And you look down at Yokneam;
											everything is so small and tiny.
											And you say, &quot;Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started.
											It&#39;s that big.
											I can&#39;t believe that I did it.&quot;
											And that&#39;s the point
											when you start loving yourself.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so we talked about
											these special words that we teach them.
											And at the end of each ride, we sit together
											and share moments
											in which those special words of the day
											popped up and made a difference,
											and these discussions
											can be extremely inspiring.
											In one of them, one of the kids once said,
											&quot;When we were riding on this ridge
											overlooking the Dead Sea —
											and he&#39;s talking about this spot here —
											&quot;I was reminded
											of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia
											and went away together with my brother.
											We walked 120 kilometers
											until we reached Sudan.
											This was the first place where we got some water and supplies.&quot;
											And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,
											probably for the first time in his life.
											And he says — because I also have volunteers riding with me,
											adults, who are sitting there
											listening to him —
											and he says, &quot;And this was just the beginning
											of our ordeal
											until we ended up in Israel.
											And only now,&quot; he says,
											&quot;I&#39;m beginning to understand where I am,
											and I actually like it.&quot;
											Now I remember, when he said it,
											I felt goosebumps on my body,
											because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.
											That&#39;s where Joshua descended
											and crossed the Jordan
											and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan
											3,000 years ago
											in this final leg
											of the journey from Africa.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so, perspective
											and context and history
											play key roles
											in the way I plan my rides
											with the kids.
											We visit Kibbutzim
											that were established by Holocaust survivors.
											We explore ruins
											of Palestinian villages,
											and we discuss how they became ruins.
											And we go through numerous remnants
											of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,
											Canaanite settlements —
											three-, four, five-thousand years old.
											And through this tapestry,
											which is the history of this country,
											the kids acquire
											what is probably the most important
											value in education,
											and that is the understanding that life is complex,
											and there&#39;s no black and white.
											And by appreciating complexity,
											they become more tolerant,
											and tolerance leads to hope.

											I ride with these kids once a week,
											every Tuesday.
											Here&#39;s a picture I took last Tuesday — less than a week ago —
											and I ride with them tomorrow also.
											In every one of these rides
											I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,
											taking in this incredible landscape around me,
											and I feel blessed and fortunate
											that I&#39;m alive,
											and that I sense every fiber
											in my aching body.
											And I feel blessed and fortunate
											that 15 years ago
											I had the courage to resign
											my tenured position at NYU
											and return to my home country
											where I can do these incredible rides
											with this group of troubled kids
											coming from Ethiopia
											and Morocco and Russia.
											And I feel blessed and fortunate
											that every week, every Tuesday —
											and actually every Friday also —
											I can once again celebrate
											in the marrow of my bones
											the very essence of living in Israel on the edge.

He&#39;s also taught at NYU, Harvard and Stanford. Together with Noam Nisan he developed a freely available, open-source, self-paced program for learning applied computer science: <a href=\"http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/\" target=\"_blank\">The Elements of Computing Systems</a>. Offered in 2005, this led to one of the first successful open online courses. Now, courses based on the approach are offered by traditional universities as well as in crowd-sourced settings, and have been taken freely by thousands of self-learners over the web. Registration, lecture and project schedules are managed by volunteer course coordinators, and student questions are answered by the course alumni community. </p><p><br />His current project focuses on developing instructional materials for early-age math education, which he thinks can be transformed using low-cost tablet computers. He uses his other life passion, mountain biking, to teach adolescent  boys in Israelʼs juvenile detention centers valuable life lessons  through challenging bike rides in remote locations.
