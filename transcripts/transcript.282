									<p>
											So, a big question that we&#39;re facing now
											and have been for quite a number of years now:
											are we at risk of a nuclear attack?
											Now, there&#39;s a bigger question
											that&#39;s probably actually more important than that,
											is the notion of permanently eliminating
											the possibility of a nuclear attack,
											eliminating the threat altogether.
											And I would like to make a case to you that
											over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry,
											until this very moment,
											we&#39;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world
											that&#39;s characterized by two phases,
											which I&#39;m going to go through with you right now.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945.
											The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons
											through the Manhattan Project,
											and the idea was very straightforward:
											we would use the power of the atom
											to end the atrocities and the horror
											of this unending World War II
											that we&#39;d been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific.
											And in 1945,
											we were the only nuclear power.
											We had a few nuclear weapons,
											two of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima,
											a few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945,
											killing about 250,000 people between those two.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And for a few years,
											we were the only nuclear power on Earth.
											But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided
											it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power,
											and they began to match what the United States had developed.
											And from 1949 to 1985
											was an extraordinary time
											of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal
											that no one could possibly have imagined
											back in the 1940s.
											So by 1985 — each of those red bombs up here
											is equivalent of a thousands warheads —
											the world had
											65,000 nuclear warheads,
											and seven members of something
											that came to be known as the &quot;nuclear club.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And it was an extraordinary time,
											and I am going to go through some of the mentality
											that we — that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing.
											But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent
											of the nuclear weapons at any particular time
											since 1985 — going forward, of course —
											were part of the arsenals
											of the United States and the Soviet Union.
											After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union,
											we began to disarm
											from a nuclear point of view.
											We began to counter-proliferate,
											and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world
											to about a total of 21,000.
											It&#39;s a very difficult number to deal with,
											because what we&#39;ve done is
											we&#39;ve quote unquote &quot;decommissioned&quot; some of the warheads.
											They&#39;re still probably usable. They could be &quot;re-commissioned,&quot;
											but the way they count things, which is very complicated,
											we think we have about a third
											of the nuclear weapons we had before.
											But we also, in that period of time,
											added two more members to the nuclear club:
											Pakistan and North Korea.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal
											among many countries around the world,
											but a very different set of circumstances.
											So I&#39;m going to talk about
											a nuclear threat story in two chapters.
											Chapter one is 1949 to 1991,
											when the Soviet Union broke up,
											and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,
											was a superpowers&#39; nuclear arms race.
											It was characterized by
											a nation-versus-nation,
											very fragile standoff.
											And basically,
											we lived for all those years,
											and some might argue that we still do,
											in a situation of
											being on the brink, literally,
											of an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.
											It&#39;s incredible that we actually lived through all that.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We were totally dependent during those years
											on this amazing acronym, which is MAD.
											It stands for mutually assured destruction.
											So it meant
											if you attacked us, we would attack you
											virtually simultaneously,
											and the end result would be a destruction
											of your country and mine.
											So the threat of my own destruction
											kept me from launching
											a nuclear attack on you. That&#39;s the way we lived.
											And the danger of that, of course, is that
											a misreading of a radar screen
											could actually cause a counter-launch,
											even though the first country had not actually launched anything.
											During this chapter one,
											there was a high level of public awareness
											about the potential of nuclear catastrophe,
											and an indelible image was implanted
											in our collective minds
											that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust
											would be absolutely globally destructive
											and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.
											So this was chapter one.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the odd thing is that even though
											we knew that there would be
											that kind of civilization obliteration,
											we engaged in America in a series —

											Less than two percent. About 1.4 percent

											did anything,

											Many buildings, public buildings, around the country —

											And one of the greatest governmental delusions

											They would propose —
											actually there were about six volumes written on this —
											a crisis relocation plan
											that was dependent upon
											the United States having three to four days warning

											The idea was that we would force the Soviets
											to re-target their nuclear weapons — very expensive —

											The main point here is we were dealing with

											The civil defense programs were disconnected
											from the reality of what we&#39;d see in all-out nuclear war.
											So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,
											around 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.
											They would do a bombing run. They&#39;d go to your city,
											and they&#39;d say, &quot;Here&#39;s a map of your city.
											Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.&quot;

											Chapter two starts in 1991.
											When the Soviet Union broke up,

											It&#39;s not completely gone. I&#39;m going to come back to that.

											the idea of an all-out nuclear war

											And there&#39;s four key ingredients to describing that.

											First thing is that the global nuclear weapons,
											in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,
											happen to be not uniformly secure.
											And it&#39;s particularly not secure
											in the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.
											There are many, many sites where warheads are stored
											and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,
											like highly enriched uranium and plutonium,
											are absolutely not safe.
											They&#39;re available to be bought, stolen, whatever.
											They&#39;re acquirable, let me put it that way.
											From 1993 through 2006,
											the International Atomic Energy Agency
											documented 175 cases of nuclear theft,
											18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,
											the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.
											The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium
											is about 1,300, at the low end,
											to about 2,100 metric tons.
											More than 100 megatons of this
											is stored in particularly insecure
											Russian facilities.
											How much of that do you think it would take
											to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?
											Well, you need about 75 pounds of it.

											So, what I&#39;d like to show you
											is
											what it would take to hold 75 pounds
											of highly enriched uranium.
											This is not a product placement. It&#39;s just —
											in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I&#39;d be pretty distressed about this —
											(Laughter)

											This is what you would need to steal or buy
											out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile
											that&#39;s relatively insecure
											to create the type of bomb
											that was used in Hiroshima.
											Now you might want to look at plutonium
											as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb.
											That — you&#39;d need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium.
											Now, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds:
											this. This is enough plutonium
											to create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.
											Now this situation, already I —
											you know, I don&#39;t really like thinking about this,
											although somehow I got myself a job
											where I have to think about it. So
											the point is that we&#39;re very, very insecure

											There&#39;s detailed information on how to assemble

											There&#39;s books about how to build a nuclear bomb.

											All of this information is relatively available.

											The third element of the nuclear terror threat
											is that, who would actually do such a thing?
											Well, what we&#39;re seeing now is a level of terrorism
											that involves individuals who are highly organized.
											They are very dedicated and committed.
											They are stateless.
											Somebody once said, Al Qaeda
											does not have a return address,
											so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon,
											what&#39;s the response, and to whom is the response?
											And they&#39;re retaliation-proof.
											Since there is no real retribution possible

											since there are people willing to actually give up their lives

											And we&#39;re trying to tell them, &quot;It&#39;s not futile.
											We can change the survival rates
											by doing some commonsensical things.&quot;

											So the goal here is to minimize fatalities.
											And I just want to leave you with the personal points
											that I think you might be interested in.
											The key to surviving a nuclear blast
											is getting out,
											and not going into harm&#39;s way.
											That&#39;s basically all we&#39;re going to be talking about here.
											And the farther you are away in distance,
											the longer it is in time
											from the initial blast;
											and the more separation between you
											and the outside atmosphere, the better.
											So separation — hopefully with dirt or concrete,
											or being in a basement —
											distance and time is what will save you.

									<p>
											So here&#39;s what you do. First of all,
											as I said, don&#39;t stare at the light flash,
											if you can. I don&#39;t know you could possibly resist doing that.
											But let&#39;s assume, theoretically, you want to do that.
											You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums
											don&#39;t burst from the pressures.
											If you&#39;re very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,
											like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.
											And you want to get under something so that you&#39;re not injured
											or killed by objects, if that&#39;s at all possible.
											You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,
											I said, in just a few minutes.
											And shelter and place. You want to move [only]
											crosswind for 1.2 miles.

									<p>
											You know, if you&#39;re out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed
											and down in that direction,
											less destroyed here,
											then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you&#39;re going this way,
											as long as you&#39;re going crosswise to the wind.
											Once you&#39;re out and evacuating,
											you want to keep as much of your skin,
											your mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering
											doesn&#39;t impede you moving and getting out of there.
											And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.
											And if you&#39;re wearing clothing, you&#39;ve taken off your clothing,
											you&#39;re going to get showered down some place
											and remove the radiation that would be —
											the radioactive material that might be on you.
											And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,
											but you&#39;re going to wait hopefully — you&#39;ll have your little wind-up,
											battery-less radio,
											and you&#39;ll be waiting for people to tell you
											when it&#39;s safe to go outside. That&#39;s what you need to do.

											In conclusion,
											nuclear war is less likely than before,
											but by no means out of the question, and it&#39;s not survivable.
											Nuclear terrorism is possible — it may be probable —
											but is survivable.
											And this is Jack Geiger, who&#39;s one of the heroes
											of the U.S. public health community.
											And Jack said the only way to deal
											with nuclear anything,
											whether it&#39;s war or terrorism,
											is abolition of nuclear weapons.
											And you want something to work on once you&#39;ve fixed global warming,
											I urge you to think about the fact that
											we have to do something about this
											unacceptable, inhumane
											reality of nuclear weapons
											in our world.

											Now, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I —
											(Laughter)
											— I don&#39;t want to be indelicate, but
											this —
											he&#39;s no longer in office. We don&#39;t really care, OK.
											This was sent to me by somebody
											who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures,
											but the fact of the matter is that
											America&#39;s gone through a very hard time.
											We&#39;ve not been focused, we&#39;ve not done what we had to do,
											and now we&#39;re facing the potential of
											bad, hell on Earth.
											Thank you.
