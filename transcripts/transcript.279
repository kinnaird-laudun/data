											Well, good morning.
											You know, the computer and television both recently turned 60,
											and today I&#39;d like to talk about their relationship.
											Despite their middle age, if you&#39;ve been following the themes
											of this conference or the entertainment industry,
											it&#39;s pretty clear that one has been picking on the other.
											So it&#39;s about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television,
											or why the invention of the atomic bomb
											unleashed forces that lead to the writers&#39; strike.
											And it&#39;s not just what these are doing to each other,
											but it&#39;s what the audience thinks that really frames this matter.

											To get a sense of this,
											and it&#39;s been a theme we&#39;ve talked about all week,
											I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners.
											I wrote on cards: &quot;television,&quot; &quot;radio,&quot; &quot;MySpace,&quot; &quot;Internet,&quot; &quot;PC.&quot;
											And I said, just arrange these, from what&#39;s important to you
											and what&#39;s not, and then tell me why.
											Let&#39;s listen to what happens when they get to the portion
											of the discussion on television.

											Let me give you an example of this. The year is 1976,
											and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise.
											The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube,
											the first interactive cable TV system,
											and the New York Times heralds this
											as telecommunications moving to the home,
											convergence, great things are happening.
											Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures —
											Citicorp, Penney, RCA — all getting into this big vision.
											By the way, this is about when I enter the picture.
											I&#39;m going to do a summer internship at Time Warner.
											That summer I&#39;m all — I&#39;m at Warner that summer —
											I&#39;m all excited to work on convergence, and then the bottom falls out.
											Doesn&#39;t work out too well for them, they lose money.
											And I had a happy brush with convergence
											until, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing.

											That&#39;s when I leave graduate school, and I can&#39;t work in New York
											on kind of entertainment and technology
											because I have to be exiled to California, where the remaining jobs are,
											almost to the sea, to go to work for Apple Computer.
											Warner, of course, writes off more than 400 million dollars.
											Four hundred million dollars, which was real money back in the &#39;70s.
											But they were onto something and they got better at it.
											By the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL,
											and in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollars
											of market capitalization, showing that they&#39;d actually mastered the art
											of applying Moore&#39;s law of successive miniaturization
											to their balance sheet.

											Now, I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities,

											is that tech folks talk differently.
											You know, for 50 years, we&#39;ve talked about changing the world,
											about total transformation.
											For 50 years, it&#39;s been about hopes and fears
											and promises of a better world. And I got to thinking,

											The most involved method is to go ahead
											and produce your own videodisc
											as well as build your own HyperCard stacks.
											By far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc
											and HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier.
											The method we illustrate in this video
											uses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks.
											This method allows you to use existing videodisc materials
											in ways which suit your specific needs and interests.

											By the way, speaking of the filing system, it never occurred to us
											that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network.
											A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee worked that out.
											It became a killer app of links, and today, of course,

											Now, not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet,

											The year is 1993

											(Video) Narrator: The pyramids, the Colosseum, the New York subway system
											and TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all.
											Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion
											of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology,
											the Digital Superhighway.
											Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians.
											The Digital Highway arrived in America&#39;s living rooms late in the twentieth century.
											Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible.
											The Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail
											first blazed by Alexander Graham Bell.
											Though some were incredulous ... Man 1: The phone company!
											Narrator: Stirred by the prospects of mass communication
											and making big bucks on advertising,
											David Sarnoff commercializes radio.
											Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.
											Narrator: The medium introduced America to new products.
											Voice 1: Say, mom, Windows for Radio means more enjoyment
											and greater ease of use for the whole family.
											Be sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work.
											Narrator: In 1939, the Radio Corporation of America introduced television.
											Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.

											And further stimulus came
											with the deregulation of the cable television industry,
											and the re-regulation of the cable television industry.
											Ted Turner: We did the work to build this, this cable industry,
											now the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean, it&#39;s ridiculous.
											Narrator: Computers, once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks,
											escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas.
											The world and all its culture reduced to bits,
											the lingua franca of all media.
											And the forces of convergence exploded.

											PH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet,

											It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media.
											Thomas Edison had the same problem.
											He wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it,
											and kind of only one of his ideas
											turned out to have been the right early idea.
											Well, you know where we&#39;re going on from here.
											We come into the era of the dotcom, the World Wide Web,
											and I don&#39;t need to tell you about that
											because we all went through that bubble together.
											But when we emerge from this and what we call Web 2.0,
											things actually are quite different.
											And I think it&#39;s the reason that TV&#39;s so challenged.
											If Internet one was about pages, now it&#39;s about people.
											It&#39;s a customer, it&#39;s an audience, it&#39;s a person who&#39;s participating.

											PH: In my own company, Technorati,
											we see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in.
											That&#39;s about 2,700 fresh, connective links
											across about 112 million blogs that are out there.
											And it&#39;s no wonder that as we head into the writers&#39; strike, odd things happen.
											You know, it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood,
											that a producer is anyone who knows a writer.
											I now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem.
											But it&#39;s not a joke. This is a real headline.
											&quot;Websites attract striking writers:
											operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com
											could benefit from labor disputes.&quot;
											Meanwhile, you have the TV bloggers going out on strike,
											in sympathy with the television writers.
											And then you have TV Guide, a Fox property,
											which is about to sponsor the online video awards —
											but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television,
											not appearing to gloat.
											To show you how schizophrenic this all is,

											PH: The company that created this, Aniboom, is an interesting example

											novels used to be the content of movies.
