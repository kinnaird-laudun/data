											There have been three themes
running through the conference

to what I want to talk about.
											One is the extraordinary
evidence of human creativity
											in all of the presentations that we&#39;ve had
											and in all of the people here.
											Just the variety of it
and the range of it.
											The second is
that it&#39;s put us in a place
											where we have no idea
what&#39;s going to happen,
											in terms of the future.
											No idea how this may play out.

											But if you ask about their education,
they pin you to the wall.
											Because it&#39;s one of those things
that goes deep with people, am I right?
											Like religion, and money and other things.
											So I have a big interest in education,
and I think we all do.
											We have a huge vested interest in it,
											partly because it&#39;s education
that&#39;s meant to take us into this future
											that we can&#39;t grasp.
											If you think of it,
children starting school this year
											will be retiring in 2065.
											Nobody has a clue,

on parade for the past four days,

											And the third part of this

capacities that children have —
											their capacities for innovation.
											I mean, Sirena last night
was a marvel, wasn&#39;t she?
											Just seeing what she could do.
											And she&#39;s exceptional, but I think
she&#39;s not, so to speak,
											exceptional in the whole of childhood.
											What you have there is a person
of extraordinary dedication
											who found a talent.
											And my contention is,
all kids have tremendous talents.

hardly ever paid attention,

											What these things have in common
is that kids will take a chance.
											If they don&#39;t know, they&#39;ll have a go.
											Am I right? They&#39;re not
frightened of being wrong.
											I don&#39;t mean to say that being wrong
is the same thing as being creative.
											What we do know is,
if you&#39;re not prepared to be wrong,
											you&#39;ll never come up
with anything original —
											if you&#39;re not prepared to be wrong.
											And by the time they get to be adults,
most kids have lost that capacity.
											They have become
frightened of being wrong.
											And we run our companies like this.
											We stigmatize mistakes.
											And we&#39;re now running
national education systems
											where mistakes are the worst
thing you can make.
											And the result is that
we are educating people

has the same hierarchy of subjects.
											Every one. Doesn&#39;t matter where you go.
											You&#39;d think it would be
otherwise, but it isn&#39;t.
											At the top are mathematics and languages,
											then the humanities,
and at the bottom are the arts.
											Everywhere on Earth.
											And in pretty much every system too,
there&#39;s a hierarchy within the arts.
											Art and music are normally
given a higher status in schools
											than drama and dance.
											There isn&#39;t an education
system on the planet
											that teaches dance everyday to children
											the way we teach them mathematics. Why?
											Why not? I think this is rather important.
											I think math is very
important, but so is dance.
											Children dance all the time
if they&#39;re allowed to, we all do.
											We all have bodies, don&#39;t we?

											Our education system is predicated
on the idea of academic ability.

that we experience it.
											We think visually, we think in sound,
we think kinesthetically.
											We think in abstract terms,
we think in movement.
											Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.
											If you look at the interactions
of a human brain,
											as we heard yesterday
from a number of presentations,
											intelligence is wonderfully interactive.
											The brain isn&#39;t divided into compartments.
											In fact, creativity —
which I define as the process
											of having original ideas
that have value —
											more often than not comes about
through the interaction
											of different disciplinary

He champions a radical rethink of our school systems, to cultivate creativity and acknowledge multiple types of intelligence. ","whylisten":"<p>Why don&#39;t we get the best out of people? Sir Ken Robinson argues that it&#39;s because we&#39;ve been educated to become good workers, rather than creative thinkers. Students with restless minds and bodies -- far from being cultivated for their energy and curiosity -- are ignored or even stigmatized, with terrible consequences. <strong>&quot;We are educating people out of their creativity,&quot; Robinson says.</strong> It&#39;s a message with deep resonance. Robinson&#39;s TED Talk has been distributed widely around the Web since its release in June 2006. The most popular words framing blog posts on his talk? &quot;Everyone should watch this.&quot; </p><p>A visionary cultural leader, Sir Ken led the British government&#39;s 1998 advisory committee on creative and cultural education, <strong>a massive inquiry into the significance of creativity in the educational system and the economy</strong>, and was knighted in 2003 for his achievements. His 2009 book, <em><a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=15\" target=\"_blank\">The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything</a></em>, is a&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 21 languages. A 10th anniversary edition of his classic work on creativity and innovation,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=15\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Out of Our Minds: Learning to be Creative</em></a>, was published in 2011. His 2013 book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=420\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Finding Your Element: How to Discover Your Talents and Passions and Transform Your Life</em></a>, is a practical guide that answers questions about finding your personal Element. In his latest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/creative-schools-the-grassroots-revolution-thats-transforming-education/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Creative Schools: The Grassroots Revolution That&rsquo;s Transforming Education</em></a>,&nbsp;he argues for an end to our outmoded industrial educational system and proposes a highly personalized, organic approach that draws on today&rsquo;s unprecedented technological and professional resources to engage all students.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity","viewed_count":51614135,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"Ken Robinson recommends\r\n","blurb":"The education expert has a lot to say about the movement to embrace creativity in the classroom.

He champions a radical rethink of our school systems, to cultivate creativity and acknowledge multiple types of intelligence. ","whylisten":"<p>Why don&#39;t we get the best out of people? Sir Ken Robinson argues that it&#39;s because we&#39;ve been educated to become good workers, rather than creative thinkers. Students with restless minds and bodies -- far from being cultivated for their energy and curiosity -- are ignored or even stigmatized, with terrible consequences. <strong>&quot;We are educating people out of their creativity,&quot; Robinson says.</strong> It&#39;s a message with deep resonance. Robinson&#39;s TED Talk has been distributed widely around the Web since its release in June 2006. The most popular words framing blog posts on his talk? &quot;Everyone should watch this.&quot; </p><p>A visionary cultural leader, Sir Ken led the British government&#39;s 1998 advisory committee on creative and cultural education, <strong>a massive inquiry into the significance of creativity in the educational system and the economy</strong>, and was knighted in 2003 for his achievements. His 2009 book, <em><a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=15\" target=\"_blank\">The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything</a></em>, is a&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 21 languages. A 10th anniversary edition of his classic work on creativity and innovation,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=15\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Out of Our Minds: Learning to be Creative</em></a>, was published in 2011. His 2013 book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=420\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Finding Your Element: How to Discover Your Talents and Passions and Transform Your Life</em></a>, is a practical guide that answers questions about finding your personal Element. In his latest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/creative-schools-the-grassroots-revolution-thats-transforming-education/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Creative Schools: The Grassroots Revolution That&rsquo;s Transforming Education</em></a>,&nbsp;he argues for an end to our outmoded industrial educational system and proposes a highly personalized, organic approach that draws on today&rsquo;s unprecedented technological and professional resources to engage all students.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Ken Robinson","tags":["children","creativity","culture","dance","education","parenting","teaching"],"title":"Do schools kill creativity?","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":51614135}]}
