											There&#39;s a great big elephant in the room called the economy.

											But of course what we have to remember is this.
											And what you have to think about is,
											when you&#39;re dancing in the flames, what&#39;s next?
											So what I&#39;m going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes
											is I&#39;m going to talk first about the flames —
											where we are in the economy —
											and then I&#39;m going to take three trends
											that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years
											and that will take place in this conference
											and I will try and bring them together.
											And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.
											Those three trends are
											the ability to engineer cells,
											the ability to engineer tissues,
											and robots.
											And somehow it will all make sense.

											But anyway, let&#39;s start with the economy.
											There&#39;s a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.
											One is leverage.
											And the problem with leverage is
											it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.

									<p>
											So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.
											That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.
											A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,
											it&#39;s an investment bank;
											it has 15 to 20 times.
											It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.
											And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.
											Oops.
											That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.
											And that, of course, is the reason why all of you
											are making such generous and wonderful donations
											to these nice folks.
											And as you think about that,
											you&#39;ve got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?
											(Laughter)
											It ain&#39;t pretty.

											The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.
											We all love Santa Claus, right?
											But the problem with Santa Clause is,
											if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing
											and promising folks,
											it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending
											on what we call &quot;entitlements.&quot;
											And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.
											And we weren&#39;t supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.
											Except we&#39;ve been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,
											that we&#39;ve brought that date of reckoning forward

											to about 2017.
											And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,
											but, guess what?
											We&#39;re going to start to pay them.
											And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill&#39;s come due,
											it turns out Santa isn&#39;t quite as cute when it&#39;s summertime.
											Right?

											Here&#39;s some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.
											This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.
											He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.
											And he gave an interview in December.
											Here&#39;s his first bit of advice.
											And here&#39;s his second bit of advice.
											And, by the way,
											the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.

											Let me show you what it looks like.
											I think I can safely say
											that I&#39;m the only trillionaire in this room.
											This is an actual bill.
											And it&#39;s 10 triliion dollars.
											The only problem with this bill is it&#39;s not really worth very much.
											That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,
											a buck next week.
											And that&#39;s what happens to currencies when you don&#39;t stand behind them.
											So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,
											and sometimes this creature&#39;s called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want —
											you&#39;ve just got to say no.
											And you&#39;ve got to start banishing a word that&#39;s called &quot;entitlement.&quot;
											And the reason we have to do that in the short term
											is because we have just run out of cash.

											If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.
											The orange slice is what&#39;s discretionary.
											Everything else is mandated.
											It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.
											So what we have to start thinking about doing
											is capping our medical spending
											because that&#39;s a monster that&#39;s simply going to eat the entire budget.
											We&#39;ve got to start thinking about asking people
											to retire a little bit later.
											If you&#39;re 60 to 65 you retire on time.
											Your 401(k) just got nailed.
											If you&#39;re 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.
											If you&#39;re under 50 we want you to work four more years.
											The reason why that&#39;s reasonable is,
											when your grandparents were given Social Security,
											they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.
											Sixty-eight is young today.
											We&#39;ve also got to cut the military about three percent a year.

											And its 225 largest companies today
											are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.
											We don&#39;t fix this now,

											Now, right behind the financial crisis there&#39;s a second and bigger wave
											that we need to talk about.
											That wave is much larger, much more powerful,
											and that&#39;s of course the wave of technology.
											And what&#39;s really important in this stuff is,
											as we cut, we also have to grow.
											Among other things, because startup companies
											are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm
											and they&#39;re about 17.8 percent of output.
											It&#39;s groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.

											Craig Venter showed up last year
											and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware
											where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.
											In parallel, the folks at MIT
											have been building a standard registry of biological parts.
											So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.
											You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.
											And start building stuff.
											In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students

											Here was one of the first things they built.
											So, cells have this cycle.
											First they don&#39;t grow.
											Then they grow exponentially.
											Then they stop growing.
											Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.
											So they engineered these cells
											so that when they&#39;re growing in the exponential phase,
											they would smell like wintergreen.
											And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.
											And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working

											that can re-generate its limbs.
											You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.
											You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.

											But now, you don&#39;t have to have the animal itself to regenerate,

											And, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,
											you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.
											This should not surprise you, right?
											I mean, you&#39;re born with no teeth.
											You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.
											You re-grow a set of teeth.

											But, of course, for most of us,
											we know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,
											put them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,
											and simply implant it.
											And we can do it with other things.
											So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,
											they took all the cells off the trachea,
											they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.
											She regrew her own trachea,
											and 72 hours later it was implanted.

											And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,
											because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin&#39;s birth.
											And it&#39;s the 150th anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Origin of Species.&quot;
											And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.
											It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.
											There have actually been 22 species of hominids
											that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,
											have gone extinct.
											It is common for hominids to evolve.
											And that&#39;s the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,
											erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,
											and Homo sapiens, all overlap.
											The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,

											And as you think of the implications of that,
											here&#39;s a brief history of the universe.
											The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,
											and then you created all the stars, and all the planets,
											and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.
											And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,
											and then you got life about four billion years ago,
											and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,

											and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,
											and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff
											is to create what&#39;s in this room.
											Maybe not.
											That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.

											I think we&#39;re going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.
											And I think this isn&#39;t 1,000 years out.
											I think most of us are going to glance at it,

Eventually, as we seriously consider colonizing other planets, these types of machines and capabilities will be essential building blocks.","note":"","link_url":"http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_bigdog.html","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":null},{"label":"READ_Article","headline":"The Fast Life of Oscar Pistorius","blurb":"This article tracks the fascinating tale of the Paralympian athlete and reminds us that enhanced physicality does not always mean enhanced ethics, judgment and brains.
