<title>Vincent Cochetel: I was held hostage for 317 days. Here&#39;s what I thought about… | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Vincent Cochetel was held hostage for 317 days in 1998, while working for the UN High Commissioner on Refugees in Chechnya. For the first time, he recounts the experience — from what it was like to live in a dark, underground chamber, chained to his bed, to the unexpected conversations he had with his captors. With lyricism and power, he explains why he continues his work today. Since 2000, attacks on humanitarian aid workers have tripled — and he wonders what that rise may signal to the world." />

<meta content="I was held hostage for 317 days. Here's what I thought about…" itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Vincent Cochetel was held hostage for 317 days in 1998, while working for the UN High Commissioner on Refugees in Chechnya. For the first time, he recounts the experience — from what it was like to live in a dark, underground chamber, chained to his bed, to the unexpected conversations he had with his captors. With lyricism and power, he explains why he continues his work today. Since 2000, attacks on humanitarian aid workers have tripled — and he wonders what that rise may signal to the world.' itemprop='description'>

											For me, they were colleagues

in Chechnya in the &#39;90s.
											They were nurses, logisticians,
shelter experts,
											paralegals, interpreters.
											And for this service, they were murdered,

to be at the side of the victim,

protection themselves,

											When you see the headlines
of your newspaper these days

											aid worker abducted, hostage executed —
											but who were they?
											Why were they there?
											What motivated them?
											How did we become
so indifferent to these crimes?
											This is why I am here today with you.
											We need to find better ways
to remember them.
											We also need to explain the key values

											Yet on a cold winter night
of January &#39;98, it was my turn.
											When I entered my flat
in Vladikavkaz with a guard,
											we were surrounded by armed men.
											They took the guard,
they put him on the floor,
											they beat him up in front of me,
											tied him, dragged him away.
											I was handcuffed, blindfolded,
and forced to kneel,
											as the silencer of a gun
pressed against my neck.
											When it happens to you,
											there is no time for thinking,
no time for praying.
											My brain went on automatic,
											rewinding quickly
the life I&#39;d just left behind.
											It took me long minutes to figure out
											that those masked men there
were not there to kill me,
											but that someone, somewhere,
had ordered my kidnapping.
											Then a process of dehumanization
started that day.
											I was no more than just a commodity.

											I normally don&#39;t talk about this,
											but I&#39;d like to share a bit with you
some of those 317 days of captivity.
											I was kept in an underground cellar,
											total darkness,
											for 23 hours and 45 minutes every day,
											and then the guards 
would come, normally two.
											They would bring a big piece of bread,
											a bowl of soup, and a candle.
											That candle would burn for 15 minutes,
											15 minutes of precious light,
											and then they would take it away,
and I returned to darkness.
											I was chained by a metal cable to my bed.
											I could do only four small steps.
											I always dreamt of the fifth one.
											And no TV, no radio,
no newspaper, no one to talk to.
											I had no towel, no soap, no toilet paper,
											just two metal buckets open,
one for water, for one waste.
											Can you imagine that mock execution
can be a pastime for guards
											when they are sadistic
or when they are just bored or drunk?
											We are breaking my nerves very slowly.

											Isolation and darkness
are particularly difficult to describe.
											How do you describe nothing?
											There are no words for the depths
of loneliness I reached
											in that very thin border
between sanity and madness.
											In the darkness, sometimes
I played imaginary games of checkers.
											I would start with the black,
											play with the white,
											back to the black
trying to trick the other side.
											I don&#39;t play checkers anymore.
											I was tormented by the thoughts of my
family and my colleague, the guard, Edik.
											I didn&#39;t know what had happened to him.
											I was trying not to think,
											I tried to fill up my time
											by doing all sorts of physical
exercise on the spot.
											I tried to pray, I tried all sorts
of memorization games.
											But darkness also creates images
and thoughts that are not normal.
											One part of your brain wants you
to resist, to shout, to cry,
											and the other part of the brain
orders you to shut up
											and just go through it.
											It&#39;s a constant internal debate;
there is no one to arbitrate.

											Once a guard came to me,
very aggressively, and he told me,
											&quot;Today you&#39;re going to kneel
and beg for your food.&quot;
											I wasn&#39;t in a good mood,
so I insulted him.
											I insulted his mother,
I insulted his ancestors.
											The consequence was moderate:
he threw the food into my waste.
											The day after he came back
with the same demand.
											He got the same answer,
											which had the same consequence.
											Four days later,
the body was full of pain.
											I didn&#39;t know hunger hurt so much
when you have so little.
											So when the guards came down,
											I knelt.
											I begged for my food.
											Submission was the only way for me
to make it to another candle.

											After my kidnapping,
											I was transferred
from North Ossetia to Chechnya,
											three days of slow travel
in the trunks of different cars,
											and upon arrival, I was interrogated
											for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.
											The routine was always the same:

											he would ask the guards
to tie me on the chair,
											and he would turn on the music loud.

											I&#39;ll spare you the details.
											There are many questions
I could not understand,
											and there are some questions
I did not want to understand.

was the duration of the tape:

											On one day, one night in that cellar,
I don&#39;t know what it was,
											I heard a child crying above my head,
											a boy, maybe two or three years old.
											Footsteps, confusion, people running.
											So when Ruslan came the day after,
											before he put the first question to me,
											I asked him, &quot;How is your son today?
Is he feeling better?&quot;
											Ruslan was taken by surprise.
											He was furious that the guards
may have leaked some details
											about his private life.
											I kept talking about NGOs
supplying medicines to local clinics
											that may help his son to get better.
											And we talked about education,
we talked about families.
											He talked to me about his children.
											I talked to him about my daughters.
											And then he&#39;d talk about guns,
about cars, about women,
											and I had to talk about guns,
about cars, about women.
											And we talked until

											Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met.

											Two days after, I was transferred
to another place.
											There, a guard came to me,
very close — it was quite unusual —
											and he said with
a very soft voice, he said,
											&quot;I&#39;d like to thank you
											for the assistance your organization
provided my family
											when we were displaced
in nearby Dagestan.&quot;
											What could I possibly reply?
											It was so painful.

											It took me weeks of internal thinking
to try to reconcile

to assist that family

											Until then, I had assumed
that they know why we are there
											and what we are doing.
											One cannot assume this.
											Well, explaining why we do this
is not that easy,

											We are not perfect, we are not superior,
											we are not the world&#39;s fire brigade,
											we are not superheroes,
											we don&#39;t stop wars,

a substitute for political solution.

											When you have a tsunami,
an earthquake or a typhoon,

know the risk they are taking

											Do you know that since the millennium,
