											It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer
											from Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage
											literally on the other side of the world.
											And I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you&#39;ve heard
											about Australians are true.
											From the youngest of ages, we display
											a prodigious sporting talent.
											On the field of battle, we are brave and noble warriors.
											What you&#39;ve heard is true.
											Australians, we don&#39;t mind a bit of a drink,
											sometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations. (Laughter)
											This is my father&#39;s work Christmas party, December 1973.
											I&#39;m almost five years old. Fair to say,
											I&#39;m enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was.

											I cast my mind back when I was in second grade
											at a beautiful little government-run school
											called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney,
											and as we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher,
											Ms. Russell, said to the class,
											&quot;Hey, year two. What do you want to do after lunch?
											I&#39;ve got no plans.&quot;
											It was an exercise in democratic schooling,
											and I am all for democratic schooling, but we were only seven.
											So some of the suggestions we made as to what
											we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical,
											and after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion
											and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism,
											&quot;That wouldn&#39;t work.
											That&#39;d be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole.&quot;

											Now I wasn&#39;t trying to be smart.
											I wasn&#39;t trying to be funny.
											I just politely raised my hand,
											and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said,
											in front of my year two classmates, and I quote,
											&quot;But Miss,
											surely if the diagonal of the square
											is less than the diameter of the circle,
											well, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											&quot;It&#39;d be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;

											And there was that same awkward silence
											from most of my classmates,
											until sitting next to me, one of my friends,
											one of the cool kids in class, Steven, leaned across
											and punched me really hard in the head.
											(Laughter)
											Now what Steven was saying was, &quot;Look, Adam,
											you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend.

											Today we&#39;re going to talk about prime numbers.
											Most of you I&#39;m sure remember that six is not prime
											because it&#39;s 2 x 3.
											Seven is prime because it&#39;s 1 x 7,
											but we can&#39;t break it down into any smaller chunks,
											or as we call them, factors.
											Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers.
											One is not prime.
											The proof of that is a great party trick
											that admittedly only works at certain parties.

											Another thing about primes, there is no final biggest prime number.
											They keep going on forever.
											We know there are an infinite number of primes
											due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid.
											Over thousands of years ago, he proved that for us.
											But the third thing about prime numbers,
											mathematicians have always wondered,
											well at any given moment in time,
											what is the biggest prime that we know about?

											Today we&#39;re going to hunt for that massive prime.
											Don&#39;t freak out.
											All you need to know, of all the mathematics
											you&#39;ve ever learned, unlearned, crammed, forgotten,
											never understood in the first place,
											all you need to know is this:
											When I say 2 ^ 5,
											I&#39;m talking about five little number twos next to each other
											all multiplied together,
											2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2.
											So 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4,
											8, 16, 32.
											If you&#39;ve got that, you&#39;re with me for the entire journey. Okay?
											So 2 ^ 5,
											those five little twos multiplied together.
											(2 ^ 5) - 1 = 31.
											31 is a prime number, and that five in the power
											is also a prime number.
											And the vast bulk of massive primes we&#39;ve ever found
											are of that form:
											two to a prime number, take away one.
											I won&#39;t go into great detail as to why,
											because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do,
											but suffice to say, a number of that form
											is fairly easy to test for primacy.
											A random odd number is a lot harder to test.
											But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes,
											we realize it&#39;s not enough
											just to put in any prime number in the power.
											(2 ^ 11) - 1 = 2,047,
											and you don&#39;t need me to tell you that&#39;s 23 x 89.
											(Laughter)
											But (2 ^ 13) - 1, (2 ^ 17) - 1
											(2 ^ 19) - 1, are all prime numbers.
											After that point, they thin out a lot.

											And one of the things about the search for massive primes
											that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds
											of all time have gone on this search.
											This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.
											In the 1700s, other mathematicians said
											he is simply the master of us all.
											He was so respected, they put him on European currency
											back when that was a compliment.

											Euler discovered at the time the world&#39;s biggest prime:
											(2 ^ 31) - 1.
											It&#39;s over two billion.
											He proved it was prime with nothing more
											than a quill, ink, paper and his mind.

											Look at it here: 39 digits long,
											proven to be prime in 1876
											by a mathematician called Lucas.
											Word up, L-Dog.

											But one of the great things about the search for massive primes,
											it&#39;s not just finding the primes.
											Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting.
											Lucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1,
											21 digits long, was not prime.
											But he didn&#39;t know what the factors were.
											We knew it was like six, but we didn&#39;t know
											what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together

											We didn&#39;t know for almost 40 years
											until Frank Nelson Cole came along.
											And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians,
											he walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk,
											and started writing out the powers of two:
											two, four, eight, 16 —
											come on, join in with me, you know how it goes —
											32, 64, 128, 256,
											512, 1,024, 2,048.
											I&#39;m in geek heaven. We&#39;ll stop it there for a second.

											He went on and on
											and calculated 67 powers of two.
											He took away one and wrote that number on the board.
											A frisson of excitement went around the room.
											It got even more exciting when he then wrote down
											these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format —
											and for the rest of the hour of his talk
											Frank Nelson Cole busted that out.
											He had found the prime factors
											of (2 ^ 67) - 1.
											The room went berserk —
											(Laughter) —
											as Frank Nelson Cole sat down,
											having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics
											with no words.
											He admitted afterwards it wasn&#39;t that hard to do.

											It&#39;s because of Curtis Cooper that we know,

											Don&#39;t forget to subtract the one.
											This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.

											For the slightly less geeky of you,

											This is all seven Harry Potter novels,

											First of all, as I explained, to ask a computer

											and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy,

											But secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime,

											My laptop at home was looking through
											four potential candidate primes myself
											as part of a networked computer hunt around the world
											for these large numbers.
											The discovery of that prime is similar to the work
											people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences,
											in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects.
											We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs

											50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team
											considered one of the deepest of all questions:
											How is it that the things that make us up have no mass?
											I&#39;ve clearly got mass. Where does it come from?
											And he postulated a suggestion
											that there&#39;s this infinite, incredibly small field
											stretching throughout the universe,
											and as other particles go through those particles
											and interact, that&#39;s where they get their mass.
											The rest of the scientific community said,

											We&#39;ve got no idea if we could ever prove it.
											It&#39;s beyond our reach.&quot;
											And within just 50 years,

											we had designed the greatest machine ever
											to prove this incredible idea
