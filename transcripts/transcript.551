<title>Shashi Tharoor: Why nations should pursue soft power | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: India is fast becoming a superpower, says Shashi Tharoor -- not just through trade and politics, but through &quot;soft&quot; power, its ability to share its culture with the world through food, music, technology, Bollywood. He argues that in the long run it&#39;s not the size of the army that matters as much as a country&#39;s ability to influence the world&#39;s hearts and minds." />

											As an Indian, and now as a politician
											and a government minister,
											I&#39;ve become rather concerned about
											the hype we&#39;re hearing about our own country,
											all this talk about India becoming a world leader,
											even the next superpower.
											In fact, the American publishers of my book,
											&quot;The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,&quot;
											added a gratuitous subtitle saying,
											&quot;India: The next 21st-century power.&quot;
											And I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s what India&#39;s all about,
											or should be all about.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership
											seems to me terribly archaic.
											It&#39;s redolent of James Bond movies
											and Kipling ballads.
											After all, what constitutes a world leader?
											If it&#39;s population, we&#39;re on course to top the charts.
											We will overtake China by 2034.
											Is it military strength? Well, we have the world&#39;s fourth largest army.
											Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.
											The Americans have even recognized it,
											in an agreement.
											Is it the economy? Well, we have now
											the fifth-largest economy in the world
											in purchasing power parity terms.
											And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,
											we grew at 6.7 percent.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But, somehow, none of that adds up to me,
											to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,
											in this part of the 21st century.
											And so I wondered, could
											what the future beckons for India to be all about
											be a combination of these things allied to something else,
											the power of example,
											the attraction of India&#39;s culture,
											what, in other words, people like to call &quot;soft power.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,
											Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.
											And, very simply, and I&#39;m really cutting it short because of the time limits here,
											it&#39;s essentially the ability of a country to attract others
											because of its culture, its political values,
											its foreign policies.
											And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,
											but we know the Alliance Francaise
											is all about French soft power, the British Council.
											The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.
											Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.
											But, the fact is, in fact,
											that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds
											have done more for American soft power
											around the world than any specifically government activity.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So soft power is something that really emerges
											partly because of governments,
											but partly despite governments.
											And in the information era we all live in today,
											what we might call the TED age,
											I&#39;d say that countries are increasingly being judged
											by a global public that&#39;s been fed
											on an incessant diet of Internet news,
											of televised images,
											of cellphone videos, of email gossip.
											In other words, all sorts of communication devices
											are telling us the stories of countries,
											whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, in this age, again, countries with access
											to multiple channels of communication
											and information have a particular advantage.
											And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they&#39;re seen.
											India has more all-news TV channels
											than any country in the world,
											in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But, the fact still is that it&#39;s not just that.
											In order to have soft power, you have to be connected.
											One might argue that India has become
											an astonishingly connected country.
											I think you&#39;ve already heard the figures.
											We&#39;ve been selling 15 million cellphones a month.
											Currently there are 509 million cellphones
											in Indian hands, in India.
											And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.
											In fact, those 15 million cellphones
											are the most connections that any country,
											including the U.S. and China,
											has ever established in the history of telecommunications.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But, what perhaps some of you don&#39;t realize
											is how far we&#39;ve come to get there.
											You know, when I grew up in India,
											telephones were a rarity.
											In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament
											had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines
											as a favor to those they deemed worthy.
											If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman
											or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.
											But sometimes it just sat there.

											I went to high school in Calcutta.
											And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.
											But half the time we would pick it up
											with an expectant look on our faces,
											there would be no dial tone.
											If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,
											the odds were two in three you wouldn&#39;t get the number you were intending to reach.
											In fact the words &quot;wrong number&quot; were more popular than the word &quot;Hello.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											If you then wanted to connect to another city,
											let&#39;s say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,
											you&#39;d have to book something called a trunk call,
											and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.
											Or you could pay eight times the going rate
											for something called a lightning call.
											But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,
											so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.

											and they&#39;re chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.

											And this is happening more and more.
											Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem
											Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world.
											India doesn&#39;t have a military mission there.
											You know what was India&#39;s biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?
											One simple fact:
											you couldn&#39;t try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.
											Why? Because that was the moment
											when the Indian television soap opera,
											&quot;Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi,&quot; dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.
											And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.
											Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.
											They had to suspend functions at 8:30.
											Weddings were reported to be interrupted
											so guests could cluster around the T.V. set,
											and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.
											Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch —
											so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency —
											about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*
											stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,
											its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,
											any moving part they could find, at 8:30,
											because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.
											And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show&#39;s heroine,
											&quot;Tulsi Zindabad&quot;: &quot;Long live Tulsi.&quot;

											That&#39;s soft power. And that is what India is developing
											through the &quot;E&quot; part of TED:
											its own entertainment industry.
											The same is true, of course — we don&#39;t have time for too many more examples —
											but it&#39;s true of our music, of our dance,
											of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.
											I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants
											since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid &#39;70s,
											and what I see today, you can&#39;t go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America
											and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.
											But, today in Britain, for example,
											Indian restaurants in Britain
											employ more people than the coal mining,

											It&#39;s a civilizational story to begin with.

											You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,
											the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.
											And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population
											keeps growing by 20 million a year.
											But, the fact is
											that the last elections, five years ago,
											gave the world extraordinary phenomenon
											of an election being won by a woman political leader
											of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,
											who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,
											to be sworn in as Prime Minister

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This is India, and of course it&#39;s all the more striking
											because it was four years later that we all applauded
											the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,
											more than 220 years of free and fair elections,
											which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president
											who wasn&#39;t white, male or Christian.
											So, maybe — oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon —
											and he is male, but he isn&#39;t white.
											All the others have been all those three.

											But, the issue is
											that when I talked about that example,
											it&#39;s not just about talking about India, it&#39;s not propaganda.
											Because ultimately, that electoral outcome
											had nothing to do with the rest of the world.
											It was essentially India being itself.
											And ultimately, it seems to me,
											that always works better than propaganda.
											Governments aren&#39;t very good at telling stories.
											But people see a society for what it is,

											will make a difference in today&#39;s information era,

											So India now is no longer
											the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,
											because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,
											we&#39;ve every religion know to mankind,
											with the possible exception of Shintoism,
											though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.
											We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.
											And those of you who cashed your money here
											might be surprised to see how many scripts there are
											on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.
											We&#39;ve got all of that.
											We don&#39;t even have geography uniting us,
											because the natural geography of the subcontinent
											framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked
											by the partition with Pakistan in 1947.
											In fact, you can&#39;t even take the name of the country for granted,
											because the name &quot;India&quot; comes from the river Indus,

											But, the whole point is that India
											is the nationalism of an idea.
											It&#39;s the idea of an ever-ever-land,
											emerging from an ancient civilization,
											united by a shared history,
											but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.
											That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.
											And it&#39;s the nationalism of an idea that
											essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,
											color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,
											and still rally around a consensus.
											And the consensus is of a very simple principle,
											that in a diverse plural democracy like India
											you don&#39;t really have to agree on everything all the time,
											so long as you agree on the ground rules
											of how you will disagree.
											The great success story of India,
											a country that so many learned scholars and journalists
											assumed would disintegrate, in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s,
											is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.

											Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.
											And I do want to make the point
											that if there is anything worth celebrating about India,
											it isn&#39;t military muscle, economic power.
											All of that is necessary,
											but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.
											Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.
											We can&#39;t really be both of those.
											We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the
											hardware of development,
											the ports, the roads, the airports,
											all the infrastructural things we need to do,
											and the software of development,
											the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India
											to be able to have a couple of square meals a day,
											to be able to send his or her children
											to a decent school,
											and to aspire to work a job
											that will give them opportunities in their lives
											that can transform themselves.

											But, it&#39;s all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,
											those real challenges which none of us can pretend don&#39;t exist.
											But, it&#39;s all taking place in an open society,
											in a rich and diverse and plural civilization,
											in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill
											the creative energies of its people.
											That&#39;s why India belongs at TED,
