											I want to tell you
											how 20,000 remarkable young people
											from over 100 countries
											ended up in Cuba
											and are transforming health in their communities.
											Ninety percent of them would never
											have left home at all
											if it weren&#39;t for a scholarship
to study medicine in Cuba
											and a commitment to go back
											to places like the ones they&#39;d come from —
											remote farmlands, mountains, ghettos —
											to become doctors for people like themselves,
											to walk the walk.

											Havana&#39;s Latin American Medical School:
											It&#39;s the largest medical school in the world,
											graduating 23,000 young doctors
											since its first class of 2005,
											with nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline.
											Its mission, to train physicians for the people
											who need them the most:
											the over one billion
											who have never seen a doctor,
											the people who live and die
											under every poverty line ever invented.
											Its students defy all norms.
											They&#39;re the school&#39;s biggest risk
											and also its best bet.
											They&#39;re recruited from the poorest,
											most broken places on our planet
											by a school that believes they can become
											not just the good
											but the excellent physicians
											their communities desperately need,
											that they will practice where most doctors don&#39;t,
											in places not only poor
											but oftentimes dangerous,
											carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks
											or navigating neighborhoods
											riddled by drugs, gangs and bullets,
											their home ground.
											The hope is that they will help
											transform access to care,
											the health picture in impoverished areas,
											and even the way medicine itself
											is learned and practiced,
											and that they will become pioneers in our global reach
											for universal health coverage,
											surely a tall order.
											Two big storms and this notion of &quot;walk the walk&quot;
											prompted creation of ELAM back in 1998.
											The Hurricanes Georges and Mitch
											had ripped through the Caribbean
											and Central America,
											leaving 30,000 dead
											and two and a half million homeless.
											Hundreds of Cuban doctors
volunteered for disaster response,
											but when they got there,
											they found a bigger disaster:
											whole communities with no healthcare,
											doors bolted shut on rural hospitals
											for lack of staff,
											and just too many babies dying
											before their first birthday.
											What would happen when these Cuban doctors left?
											New doctors were needed to make care sustainable,
											but where would they come from?
											Where would they train?

											In Havana, the campus of a former naval academy
											was turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry
											to become the Latin American Medical School,
											ELAM.
											Tuition, room and board, and a small stipend
											were offered to hundreds of students
											from the countries hardest hit by the storms.
											As a journalist in Havana,
											I watched the first 97 Nicaraguans arrive
											in March 1999,
											settling into dorms barely refurbished
											and helping their professors not
only sweep out the classrooms
											but move in the desks and the
chairs and the microscopes.
											Over the next few years,
											governments throughout the Americas
											requested scholarships for their own students,
											and the Congressional Black Caucus
											asked for and received hundreds of scholarships
											for young people from the USA.
											Today, among the 23,000
											are graduates from 83 countries
											in the Americas, Africa and Asia,
											and enrollment has grown to 123 nations.
											More than half the students are young women.
											They come from 100 ethnic groups,
											speak 50 different languages.
											WHO Director Margaret Chan said,
											&quot;For once, if you are poor, female,
											or from an indigenous population,
											you have a distinct advantage,
											an ethic that makes this medical school unique.&quot;

											Luther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho
											on the Atlantic coast of Honduras.
											There&#39;s no running water,
											no electricity there,
											and to reach the village, you have to walk for hours
											or take your chances in a pickup truck like I did
											skirting the waves of the Atlantic.
											Luther was one of 40 Tocamacho children
											who started grammar school,
											the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people
											known as the Garífuna,
											20 percent of the Honduran population.
											The nearest healthcare was fatal miles away.
											Luther had to walk three hours every day
											to middle school.
											Only 17 made that trip.
											Only five went on to high school,
											and only one to university:
											Luther, to ELAM,
											among the first crop of Garífuna graduates.
											Just two Garífuna doctors had preceded them
											in all of Honduran history.
											Now there are 69, thanks to ELAM.

											Big problems need big solutions,
											sparked by big ideas, imagination and audacity,
											but also solutions that work.
											ELAM&#39;s faculty had no handy evidence base
											to guide them, so they learned the hard way,
											by doing and correcting course as they went.
											Even the brightest students
											from these poor communities
											weren&#39;t academically prepared
											for six years of medical training,
											so a bridging course was set up in sciences.
											Then came language:
											these were Mapuche, Quechuas, Guaraní, Garífuna,
											indigenous peoples
											who learned Spanish as a second language,
											or Haitians who spoke Creole.
											So Spanish became part
											of the pre-pre-med curriculum.
											Even so, in Cuba,
											the music, the food, the smells,
											just about everything was different,
											so faculty became family, ELAM home.
											Religions ranged from indigenous beliefs
											to Yoruba, Muslim and Christian evangelical.
											Embracing diversity became a way of life.

											Why have so many countries
											asked for these scholarships?
											First, they just don&#39;t have enough doctors,
											and where they do, their distribution
											is skewed against the poor,
											because our global health crisis
											is fed by a crisis in human resources.
											We are short four to seven million health workers
											just to meet basic needs,
											and the problem is everywhere.
											Doctors are concentrated in the cities,
											where only half the world&#39;s people live,
											and within cities,
											not in the shantytowns or South L.A.
											Here in the United States,
											where we have healthcare reform,
											we don&#39;t have the professionals we need.
											By 2020, we will be short
											45,000 primary care physicians.
											And we&#39;re also part of the problem.
											The United States is the number one importer
											of doctors from developing countries.

											The second reasons students flock to Cuba
											is the island&#39;s own health report card,
											relying on strong primary care.
											A commission from The Lancet
											rates Cuba among the best performing
											middle-income countries in health.
											Save the Children ranks Cuba
											the best country in Latin
America to become a mother.
											Cuba has similar life expectancy
											and lower infant mortality than the United States,

											Academically, ELAM is tough,
											but 80 percent of its students graduate.
											The subjects are familiar —
											basic and clinical sciences —
											but there are major differences.
											First, training has moved out of the ivory tower
											and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods,
											the kinds of places most of these grads will practice.
											Sure, they have lectures and hospital rotations too,
											but community-based learning starts on day one.
											Second, students treat the whole patient,
											mind and body,
											in the context of their 
families, their communities
											and their culture.
											Third, they learn public health:
											to assess their patients&#39; drinking water, housing,
											social and economic conditions.
											Fourth, they are taught
											that a good patient interview
											and a thorough clinical exam
											provide most of the clues for diagnosis,
											saving costly technology for confirmation.
											And finally, they&#39;re taught over and over again
											the importance of prevention,
											especially as chronic diseases
											cripple health systems worldwide.

											Such an in-service learning
											also comes with a team approach,
											as much how to work in teams
											as how to lead them,
											with a dose of humility.
											Upon graduation, these doctors share
											their knowledge with nurse&#39;s aids, midwives,
											community health workers,
											to help them become better at what they do,
											not to replace them,
											to work with shamans and traditional healers.

											ELAM&#39;s graduates:
											Are they proving this audacious experiment right?
											Dozens of projects give us an inkling
											of what they&#39;re capable of doing.
											Take the Garífuna grads.
											They not only went to work back home,
											but they organized their communities to build
											Honduras&#39; first indigenous hospital.
											With an architect&#39;s help,
											residents literally raised it from the ground up.
											The first patients walked through the doors
											in December 2007,
											and since then, the hospital has received
											nearly one million patient visits.
											And government is paying attention,
											upholding the hospital as a model
											of rural public health for Honduras.

											ELAM&#39;s graduates are smart,
											strong and also dedicated.
											Haiti, January 2010.
											The pain.
											People buried under 30 million tons of rubble.
											Overwhelming.
											Three hundred forty Cuban doctors
											were already on the ground long term.
											More were on their way. Many more were needed.
											At ELAM, students worked round the clock
											to contact 2,000 graduates.
											As a result, hundreds arrived in Haiti,
											27 countries&#39; worth, from Mali in the Sahara
											to St. Lucia, Bolivia, Chile and the USA.
											They spoke easily to each other in Spanish
											and listened to their patients in Creole
											thanks to Haitian medical students
											flown in from ELAM in Cuba.
											Many stayed for months,
											even through the cholera epidemic.

											Hundreds of Haitian graduates
											had to pick up the pieces,
											overcome their own heartbreak,
											and then pick up the burden
											of building a new public health system for Haiti.
											Today, with aid of organizations and governments
											from Norway to Cuba to Brazil,
											dozens of new health centers have been built,
											staffed, and in 35 cases, headed
											by ELAM graduates.

											Yet the Haitian story
											also illustrates some of the bigger problems
											faced in many countries.
											Take a look:
											748 Haitian graduates by 
2012, when cholera struck,
											nearly half working in the public health sector
											but one quarter unemployed,
											and 110 had left Haiti altogether.
											So in the best case scenarios,
											these graduates are staffing
											and thus strengthening public health systems,
											where often they&#39;re the only doctors around.
											In the worst cases, there are simply not enough jobs
											in the public health sector,
											where most poor people are treated,
											not enough political will, not enough resources,
											not enough anything —
											just too many patients with no care.
											The grads face pressure from their families too,
											desperate to make ends meet,
											so when there are no public sector jobs,
											these new MDs decamp into private practice,
											or go abroad to send money home.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Worst of all, in some countries,
											medical societies influence accreditation bodies
											not to honor the ELAM degree,
											fearful these grads will take their jobs
											or reduce their patient loads and income.
											It&#39;s not a question of competencies.
											Here in the USA, the California Medical Board
											accredited the school after rigorous inspection,
											and the new physicians are making good
											on Cuba&#39;s big bet,
											passing their boards and accepted
											into highly respected residencies
											from New York to Chicago to New Mexico.
											Two hundred strong, they&#39;re coming
											back to the United States energized,
											and also dissatisfied.
											As one grad put it,
											in Cuba, &quot;We are trained to provide quality care
											with minimal resources,
											so when I see all the resources we have here,
											and you tell me that&#39;s not possible,
											I know it&#39;s not true.
											Not only have I seen it work, I&#39;ve done the work.&quot;

											ELAM&#39;s graduates,
											some from right here in D.C. and Baltimore,
											have come from the poorest of the poor
											to offer health, education
											and a voice to their communities.
											They&#39;ve done the heavy lifting.
											Now we need to do our part
											to support the 23,000 and counting,
											All of us —
											foundations, residency directors, press,
											entrepreneurs, policymakers, people —
											need to step up.
											We need to do much more globally
											to give these new doctors the opportunity
											to prove their mettle.
											They need to be able
											to take their countries&#39; licensing exams.
											They need jobs in the public health sector
											or in nonprofit health centers
											to put their training and commitment to work.
											They need the chance to be
											the doctors their patients need.

											To move forward,
											we may have to find our way back
											to that pediatrician who would
											knock on my family&#39;s door
											on the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid,
											who made house calls,
											who was a public servant.
											These aren&#39;t such new ideas
											of what medicine should be.
											What&#39;s new is the scaling up
											and the faces of the doctors themselves:
											an ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she
											than a he;
											In the Amazon, Peru or Guatemala,
											an indigenous doctor;
											in the USA, a doctor of color
											who speaks fluent Spanish.
											She is well trained, can be counted on,
											and shares the face and culture of her patients,
											and she deserves our support surely,
											because whether by subway, mule, or canoe,
											she is teaching us to walk the walk.
