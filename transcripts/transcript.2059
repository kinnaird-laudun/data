<title>Melvin Russell: I love being a police officer, but we need reform | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We&#39;ve invested so much in police departments as protectors that we have forgotten what it means to serve our communities, says Baltimore Police officer Lt. Colonel Melvin Russell. It&#39;s led to coldness and callousness, and it&#39;s dehumanized the police force. After taking over as district commander in one of Baltimore&#39;s toughest neighborhoods, Russell instituted a series of reforms aimed at winning back the trust of the community and lowering the violent crime rate. &quot;Law enforcement is in a crisis,&quot; he says. &quot;But it&#39;s not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again.&quot;" />

<meta content='We&#x0027;ve invested so much in police departments as protectors that we have forgotten what it means to serve our communities, says Baltimore Police officer Lt. Colonel Melvin Russell. It&#x0027;s led to coldness and callousness, and it&#x0027;s dehumanized the police force. After taking over as district commander in one of Baltimore&#x0027;s toughest neighborhoods, Russell instituted a series of reforms aimed at winning back the trust of the community and lowering the violent crime rate. "Law enforcement is in a crisis," he says. "But it&#x0027;s not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again."' itemprop='description'>

											And even with that,
											my personal truth is that
law enforcement is in a crisis.
											It&#39;s an invisible crisis,
											and it has been for many, many years.
											Even though we in law enforcement say,
											&quot;You know what?
We can&#39;t arrest our way out of this.&quot;
											We say in law enforcement things like,
											&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s illegal to profile.&quot;
											You know what?
											In law enforcement, we even agree
that we have to adopt this thinking
											and become more oriented
to community policing.
											And yet all the while, still,
											we continue in the same vein,
											the same vein that contradicts
everything that we just admitted.

											And so that&#39;s the reason for me,
several years ago.
											Because I was tired of the racism,
I was tired of discrimination,
											I was tired of the &quot;-isms&quot;
and the schisms.
											I was just so tired.
											I was tired of the vicious cycle,
											and I was tired of it even
in the beloved agency
											in the department that I still love today.
											And so my wife and I, we sat down
											and we decided and we targeted
a date that we would retire.
											We would retire and I would
go off into the sunset,
											maybe do ministry full time,
love my wife a long time.
											Y&#39;all know what I&#39;m talking about.

											But we decided that I would retire.
											But then there was a higher power than I.
											There was a love for the city

that I was educated in —
											a city that pulled my heart
back into the system.
											So we didn&#39;t retire.
											We didn&#39;t retire
											and so what happened was,
											over the next — I would say,
18 months, 19 months,
											I had this passion to implement
some radical policing.
											And so now, over the next 19 months,
											I shifted, and I transcended
from being a drug sergeant —
											ready to retire as a drug sergeant —
											and went from level to level to level,
											until I find myself
as a district commander,
											commander of the worst district
in Baltimore city.
											We call it the Eastern District,
											the most violent district,
											the most impoverished district —
											46 percent unemployment in that district.
											National rating at that time,

											And I said, you know what?
We gotta do something different.
											We gotta do something different.
We gotta think radical.
											We gotta think outside the box.
											And so in order to bring change
that I desperately wanted
											and I desperately felt in my heart,
											I had to start listening
to that inner spirit.
											I had to start listening
to that man on the inside

that I had been trained to do.

											But we still did it.
											We still did it because we listened

											We had to change it.
											And so what we did
is we started to think holistically
											and not paramilitarily.
											So we thought differently.
											And we started to realize
											that it could never be
and never should have been
											us versus them.
											And so I decided to come
to that intersection
											where I could meet all classes,
all races, all creeds, all colors;
											where I would meet the businesses

											Off the top, we want to bring
things into the community

to the community about them.
											And we shove them into the community

											But we said we&#39;d get rid

											We said, &quot;This is your community table.

											You know, it&#39;s kinda weak.

in our protective arm.
											But we forgot to treat our communities
											like they&#39;re our customers;
											like they&#39;re our sons and daughters,
our brothers and sisters,
											our mothers and fathers.
											And so somehow, along the way,
											we&#39;ve gotten out of balance.
											And because we are a proud profession,
											it is very hard for us to look

											And so, as I try to hurry
and get through this,
											I need to say this:
											it&#39;s not just law enforcement, though.
											Because every one of us
makes up a community.
											Everybody makes up a community.
											And as communities — can I say this? —
											we have put too much responsibility

									<p>
											And then we have the audacity
and the nerve to get upset
											with law enforcement
when we take action.
											There is no way in the world
											that we, as a community,
should be calling the police
											for kids playing ball in the street.
											No way in the world that we
should be calling the police
											because my neighbor&#39;s
music is up too loud,
											because his dog came over
to my yard and did a number two;
											there&#39;s no way we should
be calling the police.
											But we have surrendered
so much of our responsibility.
											Listen, when I was a little boy
coming up in Baltimore —
											and listen, we played
rough in the street —
											I ain&#39;t never see the police
come and break us up.
											You know who came? It was the elders.
											It was the parental figures
in the community.
											It was those guardians,
it was that village mentality.
											They came and said, &quot;Stop that!&quot;
and &quot;Do this.&quot; and &quot;Stop that.&quot;
											We had mentors throughout
all of the community.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So it takes all of us, all of us.
											And when I say community,
											I&#39;m talking about everything
that makes up a community, even —
											listen, because I&#39;m a preacher,
I&#39;m very hard on the churches,
											because I believe the churches
too often have become MIA,
											missing in action.
											I believe they have shifted
over the last 10, 20 years
											from being community churches,
											where you walk outside your door,
round the corner and you&#39;re in church.
											They shifted from that and became
commuter churches.
											So you now have churches who have
become disconnected by default
											from the very community
where they&#39;re planted.
											And they don&#39;t take care
of that community.

											I could go on and on,

											Community and policing:

and I call it relational equity.
											We&#39;ve lost it with one another.
											It&#39;s not somebody else&#39;s fault —
											it&#39;s all of our fault.

											But I say this: it&#39;s not too late
for all of us to build our cities

											It is never too late.
											It is never too late.
											You see, after three years
											of my four-and-a-half-year
commandship in that district,
											three years in,
											after putting pastors
in the car with my police
											because I knew this —
it&#39;s a little secret —

											You&#39;d be getting in and out of the car,
looking to your right, talking about:
											&quot;Father, forgive me, for I have sinned,&quot;
all day long — you can&#39;t do it!
											So we came up with some
incredible initiatives,
											engagements for our community
and police to build that trust back.
											We began to deal with our youth
											and with those who we consider
are on the wrong side of the fence.
											We knew we had an economic problem,
											so we began to create jobs.
											We knew there was sickness
in our community
											and they didn&#39;t have access
to proper medical care,
											so we&#39;d partner up.
											We got to that intersection
and partnered up
											with anybody that wanted
to partner with us
											and talked about
what we needed holistically,
											never thinking about the crime.
											Because at the end of the day,
											if we took care
of the needs of the people,
											if we got to the root cause,
											the crime would take care of itself.
											It would take care of itself.

at a 40-year historical low:
											our crime numbers, our homicides —
											everything had dropped
down, back to the 1970s.
											And it might go back further,
											but the problem is, we only
started keeping data since 1970.
											Forty-year crime low, so much so,

											For the first time in 30 years,
