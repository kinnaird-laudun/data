<title>Deborah Willis and Hank Willis Thomas: A mother and son united by love and art | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: An art school professor once told Deborah Willis that she, as a woman, was taking a place from a good man -- but the storied photographer says she instead made a space for a good man, her son Hank Willis Thomas. In this moving talk, the mother and son artists describe how they draw from one another in their work, how their art challenges mainstream narratives about black life and black joy, and how, ultimately, everything comes down to love." />

<meta content='An art school professor once told Deborah Willis that she, as a woman, was taking a place from a good man — but the storied photographer says she instead made a space for a good man, her son Hank Willis Thomas. In this moving talk, the mother and son artists describe how they draw from one another in their work, how their art challenges mainstream narratives about black life and black joy, and how, ultimately, everything comes down to love.' itemprop='description'>

											It&#39;s called &quot;Sometimes
I See Myself In You,&quot;
											and it speaks to
the symbiotic relationship
											that we&#39;ve developed over the years
through our life and work.
											And really, it&#39;s because everywhere we go,
											together or apart,
											we carry these monikers.
											I&#39;ve been following
in my mother&#39;s footsteps

											My mother&#39;s taught me many things, though,

											She&#39;s taught me that love
											is an action,
											not a feeling.
											Love is a way of being,
it&#39;s a way of doing,
											it&#39;s a way of listening
and it&#39;s a way of seeing.

											DW: And also, the idea about love,
											photographers,
											they&#39;re looking for love
when they make photographs.
											They&#39;re looking and looking
and finding love.
											Growing up in North Philadelphia,
											I was surrounded by people
in my family and friends
											who made photographs
											and used the family camera
as a way of telling a story about life,
											about life of joy,
											about what it meant
to become a family in North Philadelphia.
											So I spent most of my life
searching for pictures
											that reflect on ideas
about black love, black joy
											and about family life.
											So it&#39;s really important to think about
the action of love overrules as a verb.

											HWT: Sometimes I wonder
if the love of looking is genetic,
											because, like my mother,
											I&#39;ve loved photographs
since before I can even remember.
											I think sometimes that —
after my mother and her mother —
											that photography and photographs
were my first love.
											No offense to my father,
											but that&#39;s what you get
for calling me a &quot;ham&quot;
											wherever you go.
											I remember whenever I&#39;d go
to my grandmother&#39;s house,
											she would hide all the photo albums
											because she was afraid of me asking,
											&quot;Well, who is that in that picture?&quot;
											and &quot;Who are they to you
and who are they to me,
											and how old were you
when that picture was taken?
											How old was I when that picture was taken?
											And why were they in black and white?
											Was the world in black and white

											DW: Well, that&#39;s interesting,
											just to think about the world
in black and white.
											I grew up in a beauty shop
in North Philadelphia,
											my mom&#39;s beauty shop,
looking at &quot;Ebony Magazine,&quot;
											found images that told stories
that were often not in the daily news,
											but in the family album.
											I wanted the family album
to be energetic for me,
											a way of telling stories,
											and one day I happened upon a book
in the Philadelphia Public Library
											called &quot;The Sweet Flypaper of Life&quot;
by Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes.
											I think what attracted me
as a seven-year-old,
											the title, flypaper and sweet,
											but to think about that
as a seven-year-old,
											I looked at the beautiful images
that Roy DeCarava made
											and then looked at ways
that I could tell a story about life.
											And looking for me is the act
that basically changed my life.

											DW: While studying in art school —
											it&#39;s probably true —
											I had a male professor who told me
that I was taking up a good man&#39;s space.
											He tried to stifle my dream
of becoming a photographer.
											He attempted to shame me
in a class full of male photographers.
											He told me I was out of place
and out of order as a woman,
											and he went on to say
that all you could and would do
											was to have a baby when a good man
could have had your seat in this class.
											I was shocked into silence
into that experience.
											But I had my camera,
and I was determined to prove to him
											that I was worthy
for a seat in that class.
											But in retrospect, I asked myself:
&quot;Why did I need to prove it to him?&quot;
											You know, I had my camera,
and I knew I needed to prove to myself
											that I would make
a difference in photography.
											I love photography, and no one
is going to stop me from making images.

											DW: Yeah, that year I graduated,
I got pregnant.
											Yep, he was right.
											And I had you,
											and I shook off that sexist language
that he used against me
											and picked up my camera
and made photographs daily,
											and made photographs of my pregnant belly
as I prepared for graduate school.
											But I thought about also
that black photographers were missing
											from the history books of photography,
											and I was looking
for ways to tell a story.
											And I ran across Gordon Parks&#39; book
&quot;A Choice of Weapons,&quot;
											which was his autobiography.
											I began photographing and making images,
											and I tucked away that contact sheet
that I made of my pregnant belly,
											and then you inspired me
to create a new piece,
											a piece that said, &quot;A woman
taking a place from a good man,&quot;
											&quot;You took the space from a good man,&quot;
											and then I used that language
and reversed it and said,
											&quot;I made a space for a good man, you.&quot;

											But they weren&#39;t just pictures
of men and women that we knew,

											When I was nine years old,
she published this book,
											&quot;Black Photographers, 1840-1940:
A Bio-Bibliography.&quot;
											And it&#39;s astounding to me to consider
											that in 1840, African Americans
were making photographs.
											What does it mean for us to think
											that at a time that was two, three decades
before the end of slavery,
											that people were learning how to read,
											they had to learn how to do math,
											they had to be on the cutting edge
of science and technology,
											to do math, physics and chemistry
just to make a single photograph.
											And what compelled them
to do that if not love?
											Well, that book led her to her next book,
&quot;Black Photographers, 1940-1988,&quot;
											and that book led to another book,

											DW: What I found is that
black photographers had stories to tell,
											and we needed to listen.
											And then I found and I discovered
											black photographers
like Augustus Washington,
											who made these beautiful daguerreotypes
											of the McGill family
in the early 1840s and &#39;50s.
											Their stories tended to be different,
black photographers,
											and they had a different narrative
about black life during slavery,

and telling stories about community.

											HWT: So I think I was
my mother&#39;s first student.
											Unwillingly and unwittingly —
puppet strings —
											I decided to pick up a camera,
											and thought that I
should make my own pictures
											about the then and now
and the now and then.
											I thought about
how I could use photography
											to talk about how what&#39;s going on
outside of the frame of the camera
											can affect what we see inside.
											The truth is always in the hands
of the actual image maker
											and it&#39;s up to us to really consider
what&#39;s being cut out.
											I thought I could use her research
as a jumping-off point
											of things that I was seeing in society
											and I wanted to start to think
about how I could use historical images
											to talk about the past being present
											and think about ways that we can speak
											to the perennial struggle
for human rights and equal rights
											through my appropriation of photographs
											in the form of sculpture, video,
											installation and paintings.
											But through it all,
one piece has affected me the most.
											It continues to nourish me.
											It&#39;s based off of this photograph
by Ernest Withers,
											who took this picture in 1968
											at the Memphis Sanitation Workers March
											of men and women standing collectively
to affirm their humanity.
											They were holding signs
that said &quot;I am a man,&quot;
											and I found that astounding,
because the phrase I grew up with
											wasn&#39;t &quot;I am a man,&quot;
it was &quot;I am the man,&quot;
											and I was amazed at how it went from this
collective statement during segregation
											to this seemingly selfish statement
after integration.
											And I wanted to ponder that,
											so I decided to remix that text
in as many ways as I could think of,
											and I like to think of the top line
as a timeline of American history,
											and the last line as a poem,
											and it says,
											&quot;I am the man. Who&#39;s the man.
You the man. What a man.
											I am man. I am many. I am, am I.
											I am, I am. I am, Amen.

The authors vividly display the seismic impact of emancipation on African Americans born before and after the Proclamation, providing a perspective on freedom and slavery and a way to understand the photos as documents of engagement, action, struggle, and aspiration.\r\n\r\n*Envisioning Emancipation* illustrates what freedom looked like for black Americans in the Civil War era. From photos of the enslaved on plantations and African American soldiers and camp workers in the Union Army to Juneteenth celebrations, slave reunions, and portraits of black families and workers in the American South, the images in this book challenge perceptions of slavery. They show not only what the subjects emphasized about themselves but also the ways Americans of all colors and genders opposed slavery and marked its end.\r\n\r\nFilled with powerful images of lives too often ignored or erased from historical records, *Envisioning Emancipation* provides a new perspective on American culture.","note":"Deborah Willis and Barbara Krauthamer","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Emancipation-Black-Americans-Slavery/dp/1439909857/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"WATCH","headline":"\"Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People\"","blurb":"The first documentary to explore the role of photography in shaping the identity, aspirations, and social emergence of African Americans from slavery to the present, \"Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People\" probes the recesses of American history through images that have been suppressed, forgotten, and lost.\r\n\r\nBringing to light the hidden and unknown photos shot by both professional and vernacular African American photographers, the film opens a window into the lives of black families, whose experiences and perspectives are often missing from the traditional historical canon. African Americans historically embraced the medium as a way to subvert popular stereotypes as far back as the Civil War era, with Frederick Douglass photographed in a suit and black soldiers posing proudly in their uniforms. These images show a much more complex and nuanced view of American culture and its founding ideals.\r\n\r\nInspired by the book Reflections in Black by photo historian Deborah Willis, the film features the works of esteemed photographic artists Carrie Mae Weems, Lorna Simpson, Anthony Barboza, Hank Willis Thomas, Coco Fusco, Clarissa Sligh, James Van Der Zee, Gordon Parks, and many others.\r\n","note":"Producers: Deborah Willis and Thomas Allen Harris\r\nDirector: Thomas Allen Harris","link_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/movies/through-a-lens-darkly-on-african-american-photography.html","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"EXPLORE","headline":"Exhibition: Progeny: Deborah Willis and Hank Willis Thomas","blurb":"Progeny: Deborah Willis and Hank Willis Thomas presents a selection of photographs by this mother son duo, each of whom is a notable, award-winning artist.

In this book, Deborah Willis explores historical perceptions of beauty and desire through artistic and ethnographic imagery and the role individual photographers play in constructing ways of seeing. Through the themes of idealized beauty, the unfashionable body, the gendered image, and photography as memory, Willis challenges and makes problematic the \"reading\" of photographic images in the twenty-first century.\r\nWorking from the significant photographic holdings of the University of Washington's Henry Art Gallery, and the University of Washington Libraries, Special Collections, the author examines shifting gender attitudes that emerged in work by women photographers such as Gertrude Käsebier and Diane Arbus. Willis discusses ethnographic ideologies underpinning the work of Edward Sheriff Curtis and Fred E. Miller who worked with Native American subjects, as well as the framing and reframing of images of black people in the work of Samuel Montague Fassett and Carrie Mae Weems. Additionally, the effects of fashion and desire on the imaging of beauty are examined in the work of such artists as Don Wallen, Janieta Eyre, and Jan Saudek. The book includes full-page illustrations of works by more than fifty internationally recognized photographers including Lisette Model, Imogen Cunningham, Lewis Wickes Hine, Bruce Davidson, Cecil Beaton, Nan Goldin, André Kertész, Lee Friedlander, Lorna Simpson, Cindy Sherman, and Andy Warhol.","note":"Deborah Willis","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Out-Fashion-Photography-Embracing-Beauty/dp/0295992514/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Michelle Obama: The First Lady in Photographs*\r\n","blurb":"A stunning, visual biography of Michelle Obama that finally puts her phenomenal fame into a cultural and historical context we can all understand.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a First Lady like her before. While there have been a slew of Obama celebrity books, none contain the message of Deborah Willis and Emily Bernard’s eye-opening book. With nearly 200 compelling photographs, these two noted scholars capture Michelle Obama’s dramatic transformation from working mother to First Lady, from her first tentative steps on the campaign trail to her spontaneous hug of the Queen, to her fairy-tale-like “date night” on Broadway. Not since Jacqueline Kennedy has there been a First Lady who has so enchanted America, but in her down-to-earth dealings with all Americans―schoolchildren, military families, and home gardeners alike―and in her diverse fashion taste, from J. Crew to Jason Wu, Michelle Obama is inexplicably all pearls, all business, all mother. The authors show how Michelle Obama represents the culmination of America’s evolving views on women, race, motherhood, and beauty. Much more than a mere catalog of style, Michelle Obama is a remarkable pictorial story of one woman’s hold on our imagination.\r\n","note":"Deborah Willis, Emily Bernard","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Michelle-Obama-First-Lady-Photographs/dp/0393077470/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers 1840 to the Present*","blurb":"*Reflections in Black,* the first comprehensive history of black photographers, is a groundbreaking pictorial collection of African American life.

Nearly 600 images offer rich, moving glimpses of everyday black life, from slavery to the Great Migration to contemporary suburban life, including rare antebellum daguerreotypes, photojournalism of the civil rights era, and multimedia portraits of middle-class families. A work so significant that it has the power to reconfigure our conception of American history itself, Reflections in Black demands to be included in every American family's library as an essential part of our heritage.
