<title>Andrew Solomon: Depression, the secret we share | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: &quot;The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment.&quot; In a talk equal parts eloquent and devastating, writer Andrew Solomon takes you to the darkest corners of his mind during the years he battled depression. That led him to an eye-opening journey across the world to interview others with depression -- only to discover that, to his surprise, the more he talked, the more people wanted to tell their own stories." />

<meta content='"The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment." In a talk equal parts eloquent and devastating, writer Andrew Solomon takes you to the darkest corners of his mind during the years he battled depression. That led him to an eye-opening journey across the world to interview others with depression — only to discover that, to his surprise, the more he talked, the more people wanted to tell their own stories.' itemprop='description'>

in almost everything.
											I didn&#39;t want to do any of the things
I had previously wanted to do,

											The opposite of depression
is not happiness, but vitality.
											And it was vitality
											that seemed to seep away
from me in that moment.
											Everything there was to do
seemed like too much work.
											I would come home
											and I would see the red light
flashing on my answering machine,
											and instead of being thrilled
to hear from my friends,
											I would think,
											&quot;What a lot of people that is
to have to call back.&quot;
											Or I would decide I should have lunch,

											And one of the things that often gets lost
in discussions of depression

while you&#39;re experiencing it.
											You know that most people manage
											to listen to their messages and eat lunch
											and organize themselves to take a shower
											and go out the front door
											and that it&#39;s not a big deal,
											and yet you are nonetheless in its grip
											and you are unable to figure out
any way around it.

											And then the anxiety set in.
											If you told me that I&#39;d have to be
depressed for the next month,

in November, I can do it.&quot;

people tend to confuse:

											If you have a loss

											you are still deeply sad,

that was triggered

											The trajectory tells us a great deal.

who I had known for many years,

in her freshman year of college,

into a horrific depression.

about that experience some years later —

named Maggie Robbins —
											when I interviewed her, she said,
											&quot;I was singing &#39;Where Have
All The Flowers Gone,&#39;

electroconvulsive treatment,

											If you have brain cancer,

											it may make you feel better,

for 20 minutes every day
											makes you feel better, then it&#39;s worked,
											because depression
is an illness of how you feel,

											then you are effectively
not depressed anymore.
											So I became much more tolerant

											Now at the other end
of alternative treatments,
											let me tell you about Frank Russakoff.
											Frank Russakoff had the worst depression
perhaps that I&#39;ve ever seen in a man.
											He was constantly depressed.
											He was, when I met him,
											at a point at which every month,
he would have electroshock treatment.
											Then he would feel
sort of disoriented for a week.
											Then he would feel okay for a week.
											Then he would have a week
of going downhill.
											And then he would have another
electroshock treatment.
											And he said to me when I met him,
											&quot;It&#39;s unbearable to go
through my weeks this way.
											I can&#39;t go on this way,
											and I&#39;ve figured out
how I&#39;m going to end it
											if I don&#39;t get better.&quot;
											&quot;But,&quot; he said to me,
&quot;I heard about a protocol at Mass General
											for a procedure called a cingulotomy,
which is a brain surgery,
											and I think I&#39;m going to give that a try.&quot;
											And I remember being amazed
at that point to think that someone
											who clearly had so many bad experiences
											with so many different treatments
											still had buried in him,
somewhere, enough optimism
											to reach out for one more.
											And he had the cingulotomy,
and it was incredibly successful.

									<p>
											He&#39;s now a friend of mine.
											He has a lovely wife
and two beautiful children.
											He wrote me a letter
the Christmas after the surgery,
											and he said,
											&quot;My father sent me two presents this year,
											First, a motorized CD rack
from The Sharper Image
											that I didn&#39;t really need,
											but I knew he was giving it
to me to celebrate
											the fact that I&#39;m living on my own
and have a job I seem to love.
											And the other present
was a photo of my grandmother,
											who committed suicide.
											As I unwrapped it, I began to cry,
											and my mother came over and said,
											&#39;Are you crying because
of the relatives you never knew?&#39;
											And I said, &#39;She had
the same disease I have.&#39;
											I&#39;m crying now as I write to you.
											It&#39;s not that I&#39;m so sad,
but I get overwhelmed,
											I think, because I could
have killed myself,
											but my parents kept me going,
and so did the doctors,
											and I had the surgery.
											I&#39;m alive and grateful.
											We live in the right time,
even if it doesn&#39;t always feel like it.&quot;

											I was struck by the fact that depression
											is broadly perceived to be
a modern, Western, middle-class thing,
											and I went to look at how it operated
in a variety of other contexts,
											and one of the things
I was most interested in
											was depression among the indigent.
											And so I went out to try to look
											at what was being done
for poor people with depression.
											And what I discovered is that poor people
											are mostly not being
treated for depression.
											Depression is the result
of a genetic vulnerability,
											which is presumably
evenly distributed in the population,
											and triggering circumstances,
											which are likely to be more severe
for people who are impoverished.
											And yet it turns out that if you have
a really lovely life
											but feel miserable all the time,
											you think, &quot;Why do I feel like this?
											I must have depression.&quot;
											And you set out to find treatment for it.
											But if you have a perfectly awful life,
											and you feel miserable all the time,
											the way you feel
is commensurate with your life,
											and it doesn&#39;t occur to you to think,
											&quot;Maybe this is treatable.&quot;

											And so we have an epidemic in this country
											of depression among impoverished people
											that&#39;s not being picked up
and that&#39;s not being treated
											and that&#39;s not being addressed,
											and it&#39;s a tragedy of a grand order.
											And so I found an academic
											who was doing a research project
in slums outside of D.C.,
											where she picked up women
who had come in for other health problems
											and diagnosed them with depression,
											and then provided six months
of the experimental protocol.
											One of them, Lolly, came in,
											and this is what she said
the day she came in.
											She said, and she was a woman,
by the way, who had seven children.
											She said, &quot;I used to have a job
but I had to give it up
											because I couldn&#39;t go out of the house.
											I have nothing to say to my children.
											In the morning,
I can&#39;t wait for them to leave,
											and then I climb in bed
and pull the covers over my head,
											and three o&#39;clock when they come home,
											it just comes so fast.&quot;
											She said, &quot;I&#39;ve been taking
a lot of Tylenol,
											anything I can take
so that I can sleep more.
											My husband has been telling me
I&#39;m stupid, I&#39;m ugly.
											I wish I could stop the pain.&quot;

											Well, she was brought
into this experimental protocol,
											and when I interviewed her
six months later,
											she had taken a job working in childcare
											for the U.S. Navy,
she had left the abusive husband,
											and she said to me,
											&quot;My kids are so much happier now.&quot;
											She said, &quot;There&#39;s one room
in my new place for the boys
											and one room for the girls,
											but at night, they&#39;re just
all up on my bed,
											and we&#39;re doing homework
all together and everything.
											One of them wants to be a preacher,
											one of them wants to be a firefighter,
											and one of the girls says
she&#39;s going to be a lawyer.
											They don&#39;t cry like they used to,
											and they don&#39;t fight like they did.
											That&#39;s all I need now, is my kids.
											Things keep on changing,
											the way I dress,
the way I feel, the way I act.
											I can go outside not being afraid anymore,
											and I don&#39;t think
those bad feelings are coming back,
											and if it weren&#39;t
for Dr. Miranda and that,
											I would still be at home
with the covers pulled over my head,

											So after a certain amount of negotiation,
they agreed to it.
											But I think a lot of what they said
was connected in some strange way
											to this distaste that people still have
for the idea of treatment,
											the notion that somehow if we went out
											and treated a lot of people
in indigent communities,
											that would be exploitative,
											because we would be changing them.
											There is this false moral imperative
that seems to be all around us,
											that treatment of depression,
											the medications and so on,
are an artifice,
											and that it&#39;s not natural.
											And I think that&#39;s very misguided.
											It would be natural

											People then say,

											Being able to have sadness and fear

											Shutting out the depression

											Valuing one&#39;s depression
does not prevent a relapse,
											but it may make the prospect of relapse
											and even relapse itself
easier to tolerate.
											The question is not so much
of finding great meaning
											and deciding your depression
has been very meaningful.
											It&#39;s of seeking that meaning
and thinking, when it comes again,
											&quot;This will be hellish,
but I will learn something from it.&quot;
											I have learned in my own depression
											how big an emotion can be,
											how it can be more real than facts,
											and I have found that that experience
											has allowed me to experience
positive emotion
											in a more intense and more focused way.
											The opposite of depression
