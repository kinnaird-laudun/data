<title>David Anderson: Your brain is more than a bag of chemicals | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Modern psychiatric drugs treat the chemistry of the whole brain, but neurobiologist David Anderson has a more nuanced view of how the brain functions. He shares new research that could lead to targeted psychiatric medications -- that work better and avoid side effects. How&#39;s he doing it? For a start, by making a bunch of fruit flies angry." />

											As we heard from Dr. Insel this morning,
											psychiatric disorders like autism, depression and schizophrenia
											take a terrible toll on human suffering.
											We know much less about their treatment
											and the understanding of their basic mechanisms
											than we do about diseases of the body.
											Think about it: In 2013,
											the second decade of the millennium,
											if you&#39;re concerned about a cancer diagnosis
											and you go to your doctor, you get bone scans,
											biopsies and blood tests.
											In 2013, if you&#39;re concerned about a depression diagnosis,
											you go to your doctor, and what do you get?
											A questionnaire.
											Now, part of the reason for this is that we have
											an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view
											of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.
											We tend to view them —
											and the popular press aids and abets this view —
											as chemical imbalances in the brain,
											as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup
											full of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.
											This view is conditioned by the fact
											that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders,
											like Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry,
											as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup.
											But that can&#39;t be the answer,
											because these drugs actually don&#39;t work all that well.
											A lot of people won&#39;t take them, or stop taking them,
											because of their unpleasant side effects.
											These drugs have so many side effects
											because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder
											is a bit like trying to change your engine oil
											by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.
											Some of it will dribble into the right place,
											but a lot of it will do more harm than good.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, an emerging view
											that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning,
											is that psychiatric disorders are actually
											disturbances of neural circuits that mediate
											emotion, mood and affect.
											When we think about cognition,
											we analogize the brain to a computer. That&#39;s no problem.
											Well it turns out that the computer analogy
											is just as valid for emotion.
											It&#39;s just that we don&#39;t tend to think about it that way.
											But we know much less about the circuit basis
											of psychiatric disorders
											because of the overwhelming dominance
											of this chemical imbalance hypothesis.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, it&#39;s not that chemicals are not important
											in psychiatric disorders.
											It&#39;s just that they don&#39;t bathe the brain like soup.
											Rather, they&#39;re released in very specific locations
											and they act on specific synapses
											to change the flow of information in the brain.
											So if we ever really want to understand
											the biological basis of psychiatric disorders,
											we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain
											where these chemicals act.
											Otherwise, we&#39;re going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines
											and suffering the consequences.

											Now to begin to overcome our ignorance
											of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry,
											it&#39;s helpful to work on what we biologists call
											&quot;model organisms,&quot;
											animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice,
											in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques
											to molecularly identify and pinpoint
											specific classes of neurons,
											as you heard about in Allan Jones&#39;s talk this morning.
											Moreover, once we can do that,
											we can actually activate specific neurons
											or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.
											So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron,
											and we find that a behavior is blocked,
											we can conclude that those neurons
											are necessary for that behavior.
											On the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons
											and we find that that produces the behavior,
											we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.
											So in this way, by doing this kind of test,
											we can draw cause and effect relationships
											between the activity of specific neurons
											in particular circuits and particular behaviors,
											something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible,
											to do right now in humans.

											But can an organism like a fruit fly, which is —

											because it&#39;s got a small brain,

											Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion
											and express them in their behaviors, as he wrote
											in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals.
											And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well.
											Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila
											here at CalTech in the &#39;60s as a model organism
											to study the connection between genes and behavior.
											Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.
											He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here,
											and Seymour taught me both to love flies
											and also to play with science.

									<p>
											So how do we ask this question?
											It&#39;s one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states,
											but how do we actually find out whether that&#39;s true or not?
											Now, in humans we often infer emotional states,
											as you&#39;ll hear later today, from facial expressions.
											However, it&#39;s a little difficult to do that in fruit flies.
											(Laughter)
											It&#39;s kind of like landing on Mars
											and looking out the window of your spaceship
											at all the little green men who are surrounding it
											and trying to figure out, &quot;How do I find out
											if they have emotions or not?&quot;
											What can we do? It&#39;s not so easy.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, one of the ways that we can start
											is to try to come up with some general characteristics
											or properties of emotion-like states
											such as arousal, and see if we can identify
											any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties.
											So three important ones that I can think of
											are persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.
											Persistence means long-lasting.
											We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion
											causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone.
											Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like.
											You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion.
											If you&#39;re a little bit unhappy, the corners of your mouth
											turn down and you sniffle,
											and if you&#39;re very unhappy, tears pour down your face
											and you might sob.
											Valence means good or bad, positive or negative.

									<p>
											So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing
											the kind of behavior that you see
											by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table,
											you know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger
											the more vigorously you try to swat it away,
											and it seems to keep getting irritated.
											So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat,
											in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies
											in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench
											and blow them away.
											And what we found is that if we gave these flies
											in the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row,
											they became somewhat hyperactive
											and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped
											and took a while to calm down.
											So we quantified this behavior
											using custom locomotor tracking software
											developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona,
											who&#39;s in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech.
											And what this quantification showed us is that,
											upon experiencing a train of these air puffs,
											the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity
											which is persistent, long-lasting,
											and also appears to be graded.
											More puffs, or more intense puffs,
											make the state last for a longer period of time.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So now we wanted to try to understand something
											about what controls the duration of this state.
											So we decided to use our puff-o-mat
											and our automated tracking software
											to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies
											to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.
											And this is one of the great things about fruit flies.
											There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone
											and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants
											and screen them in your assay and then find out
											what gene is affected in the mutation.
											So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant
											that took much longer than normal to calm down
											after the air puffs,
											and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation,
											it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.
											That&#39;s right — flies, like people, have dopamine,
											and it acts on their brains and on their synapses
											through the same dopamine receptor molecules
											that you and I have.
											Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain,
											including in attention, arousal, reward,
											and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked
											to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse,
											Parkinson&#39;s disease, and ADHD.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, in genetics, it&#39;s a little counterintuitive.
											We tend to infer the normal function of something
											by what doesn&#39;t happen when we take it away,
											by the opposite of what we see when we take it away.
											So when we take away the dopamine receptor
											and the flies take longer to calm down,
											from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine
											is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff.
											And that&#39;s a bit reminiscent of ADHD,
											which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.
											Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies
											by feeding them cocaine
											after getting the appropriate DEA license
											— oh my God — (Laughter) —
											we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies
											calm down faster than normal flies do,
											and that&#39;s also reminiscent of ADHD,
											which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin
											that act similarly to cocaine.
											So slowly I began to realize that what started out
											as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies
											might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder.

									<p>
											Now, how far does this analogy go?
											As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD
											also have learning disabilities.
											Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies?
											Remarkably, the answer is yes.
											As Seymour showed back in the 1970s,
											flies, like songbirds, as you just heard,
											are capable of learning.
											You can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue,
											if you pair that odor with a shock.
											Then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose
											between a tube with the shock-paired odor and another odor,
											it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock.
											Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies,
											they don&#39;t learn. Their learning score is zero.
											They flunk out of CalTech.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So that means that these flies have two abnormalities,
											or phenotypes, as we geneticists call them,
											that one finds in ADHD: hyperactivity and learning disability.
											Now what&#39;s the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?
											In ADHD, it&#39;s often assumed that the hyperactivity
											causes the learning disability.
											The kids can&#39;t sit still long enough to focus, so they don&#39;t learn.
											But it could equally be the case that it&#39;s the learning disabilities
											that cause the hyperactivity.
											Because the kids can&#39;t learn, they look for other things to distract their attention.
											And a final possibility is that there&#39;s no relationship at all
											between learning disabilities and hyperactivity,
											but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now people have been wondering about this for a long time
											in humans, but in flies we can actually test this.
											And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind
											of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics.
											We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies
											and we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor
											by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene
											back into the fly brain.
											But in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons
											and not in others, and then we test each of these flies
											for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Remarkably, we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities.
											If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back
											in this elliptical structure called the central complex,
											the flies are no longer hyperactive, but they still can&#39;t learn.
											On the other hand, if we put the receptor back in a different structure
											called the mushroom body,
											the learning deficit is rescued, the flies learn well,
											but they&#39;re still hyperactive.
											What that tells us is that dopamine
											is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup.
											Rather, it&#39;s acting to control two different functions
											on two different circuits,
											so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies
											is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions
											in two different regions of the brain.
											Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans
											we don&#39;t know, but these kinds of results
											should at least cause us to consider that possibility.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever
											that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup,
											and it&#39;s a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders
											just by changing the flavor of the soup.
											What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge
											to try to design a new generation of treatments
											that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain
											that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders.
											If we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders
											without the unpleasant side effects,
											putting the oil back in our mental engines,
											just where it&#39;s needed. Thank you very much.

By researching these cause-and-effect relationships, Anderson hopes to pave the way for the development of new treatments for psychiatric disorders that are far more targeted and have far fewer side effects.</p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Trained by two Nobel laureates, Gunter Blobel and Richard Axel, Anderson is also an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"David Anderson","tags":["TEDx","brain","insects","neuroscience","mental health"],"title":"Your brain is more than a bag of chemicals","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1386645}]}
