<title>Geoffrey Canada: Our failing schools. Enough is enough! | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why, why, why does our education system look so similar to the way it did 50 years ago? Millions of students were failing then, as they are now -- and it’s because we’re clinging to a business model that clearly doesn’t work. Education advocate Geoffrey Canada dares the system to look at the data, think about the customers and make systematic shifts in order to help greater numbers of kids excel." />

											Do not tell me they could not reach those kids

											Those of us in education have held on to a business plan
											that we don&#39;t care how many millions of young people fail,
											we&#39;re going to continue to do the same thing that didn&#39;t work,
											and nobody is getting crazy about it — right? —

											You know, I grew up in the inner city,
											and there were kids who were failing
											in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school,
											and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later.
											And you know something about a lousy school?
											It&#39;s not like a bottle of wine.
											Right? (Laughter)
											Where you say, like, &#39;87 was like a good year, right?
											That&#39;s now how this thing — I mean, every single year,
											it&#39;s still the same approach, right?
											One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don&#39;t,
											tough luck. Just tough luck.
											Why haven&#39;t we allowed innovation to happen?
											Do not tell me we can&#39;t do better than this.

											Look, you go into a place that&#39;s failed kids for 50 years,
											and you say, &quot;So what&#39;s the plan?&quot;
											And they say, &quot;We&#39;ll, we&#39;re going to do
											what we did last year this year.&quot;
											What kind of business model is that?
											Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3.
											They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour.
											Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.
											They don&#39;t need banks. They got no money in the banks.
											Who created that business model? Right?
											And it went on for decades.
											You know why? Because they didn&#39;t care.
											It wasn&#39;t about the customers.
											It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.
											How could you go to the bank
											when you were at work? It didn&#39;t matter.
											And they don&#39;t care whether or not Geoff is upset
											he can&#39;t go to the bank. Go find another bank.
											They all operate the same way. Right?
											Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea.
											Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work.
											They might like that. What about a Saturday?
											What about introducing technology?

											Now look, I&#39;m a technology fan, but I have to admit

											So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology,

											So technology has changed. Things have changed.
											Yet not in education. Why?
											Why is it that when we had rotary phones,
											when we were having folks being crippled by polio,
											that we were teaching
											the same way then that we&#39;re doing right now?
											And if you come up with a plan to change things,
											people consider you radical.
											They will say the worst things about you.
											I said one day, well, look, if the science says —
											this is science, not me — that our poorest children
											lose ground in the summertime —
											You see where they are in June and say, okay, they&#39;re there.
											You look at them in September, they&#39;ve gone down.
											You say, whoo! So I heard about that in &#39;75
											when I was at the Ed School at Harvard.
											I said, &quot;Oh, wow, this is an important study.&quot;
											Because it suggests we should do something.
											(Laughter)
											Every 10 years they reproduce the same study.
											It says exactly the same thing:
											Poor kids lose ground in the summertime.
											The system decides you can&#39;t run schools in the summer.

											You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?
											For years I went to — Look, I went the Harvard Ed School.
											I thought I knew something.
											They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had —
											but let me tell you why that doesn&#39;t make sense.
											I never got that. I never got that,
											because anyone knows if you farm,
											you don&#39;t plant crops in July and August.
											You plant them in the spring.
											So who came up with this idea? Who owns it?
											Why did we ever do it?
											Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have,
											schools were open all year. They were open all year,
											because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day.
											They didn&#39;t have any place for their kids to go.
											It was a perfect place to have schools.
											So this is not something that is ordained

											How many places in America are going to change? None.

											Here&#39;s what we know.
											We know that the problem begins immediately.
											Right? This idea, zero to three.
											My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids,
											three grown ones and a 15-year-old.
											That&#39;s a longer story.
											(Laughter)
											With our first kids, we did not know the science
											about brain development.
											We didn&#39;t know how critical those first three years were.
											We didn&#39;t know what was happening in those young brains.
											We didn&#39;t know the role that language,
											a stimulus and response, call and response,
											how important that was in developing those children.
											We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing.
											Wealthy people know. Educated people know.
											And their kids have an advantage.

											Now, you take pre-kindergarten.
											We know it&#39;s important for kids.
											Poor kids need that experience.
											Nope. Lots of places, it doesn&#39;t exist.
											We know health services matter.
											You know, we provide health services
											and people are always fussing at me about, you know,
											because I&#39;m all into accountability and data
											and all of that good stuff, but we do health services,
											and I have to raise a lot of money.
											People used to say when they&#39;d come fund us,

											I used to make stuff up. Right?
											I&#39;d say, &quot;Well, you know a child

											And I had to because I had to raise the money.

											So here&#39;s the other thing.
											I&#39;m a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information,
											because you work at something, you think it&#39;s working,
											and you find out it&#39;s not working.
											I mean, you&#39;re educators. You work, you say,
											you think you&#39;ve got it, great, no? And you find out they didn&#39;t get it.
											But here&#39;s the problem with testing.
											The testing that we do —
											we&#39;re going to have our test in New York next week —
											is in April.
											You know when we&#39;re going to get the results back?
											Maybe July, maybe June.
											And the results have great data.
											They&#39;ll tell you Raheem really struggled,
											couldn&#39;t do two-digit multiplication — so great data,
											but you&#39;re getting it back after school is over.
											And so, what do you do?
											You go on vacation. (Laughter)
											You come back from vacation.
											Now you&#39;ve got all of this test data from last year.
											You don&#39;t look at it.
											Why would you look at it?
											You&#39;re going to go and teach this year.
											So how much money did we just spend on all of that?
											Billions and billions of dollars
											for data that it&#39;s too late to use.
											I need that data in September.
											I need that data in November.
											I need to know you&#39;re struggling, and I need to know
											whether or not what I did corrected that.
											I need to know that this week.
											I don&#39;t need to know that at the end of the year when it&#39;s too late.

											Because in my older years, I&#39;ve become somewhat of a clairvoyant.
											I can predict school scores.
											You take me to any school.
											I&#39;m really good at inner city schools that are struggling.
											And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids
											were on grade level.
											And I say, &quot;Okay, what&#39;s the plan, what did we do
											from last year to this year?&quot;
											You say, &quot;We&#39;re doing the same thing.&quot;
											I&#39;m going to make a prediction. (Laughter)

											So we&#39;re spending all of this money, but we&#39;re getting what?

											So here&#39;s the other issue that I just think
											we&#39;ve got to be concerned about.
											We can&#39;t stifle innovation in our business.
											We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation.
											They get angry if you do something different.
											If you try something new, people are always like,
											&quot;Ooh, charter schools.&quot; Hey, let&#39;s try some stuff. Let&#39;s see.
											This stuff hasn&#39;t worked for 55 years.
											Let&#39;s try something different. And here&#39;s the rub.
											Some of it&#39;s not going to work.
											You know, people tell me, &quot;Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don&#39;t work.&quot;
											A lot of them don&#39;t. They should be closed.
											I mean, I really believe they should be closed.
											But we can&#39;t confuse figuring out the science
											and things not working with we shouldn&#39;t therefore do anything.
											Right? Because that&#39;s not the way the world works.

									<p>
											If you think about technology,
											imagine if that&#39;s how we thought about technology.
											Every time something didn&#39;t work,
											we just threw in the towel and said, &quot;Let&#39;s forget it.&quot; Right?
											You know, they convinced me. I&#39;m sure some of you were like me —
											the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.
											They told me, &quot;Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot
											you&#39;ll never need another thing.&quot;
											That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.
											I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing.
											Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.
											The folks went out there. They kept inventing.
											The fact that you have failure, that shouldn&#39;t stop you
											from pushing the science forward.

											Our job as educators,

											we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.
											We&#39;ve got to give them all of these opportunities.
											So that we have to do. But this innovation issue,
											this idea that we&#39;ve got to keep innovating
											until we really nail this science down

											And this is something, by the way,
											that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field.
											America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right.
											We have run out of time.
											I don&#39;t know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there&#39;s an educational cliff
											that we are walking over right this very second,
											and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness
											about saying we can&#39;t afford this —

											GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems
											we have in this country is these kids, the same kids,
											these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school,
											they drop out in record numbers.
											And so we&#39;ve figured out that you&#39;ve got to really design

											mimics what a good parent does.
											They harass you, right? They call you, they say,

											But I&#39;m not kidding about some of this,

											When kids know that you refuse to let them fail,
											it puts a different pressure on them,

So upon getting his degree from Bowdoin College and continuing on to a masters in education from Harvard, Canada dedicated himself to working with kids in poor neighborhoods. In 1983, he accepted a position at the Rheedlen Institute in Harlem as education director. Seven years later, he became president and renamed it the Harlem Children&#39;s Zone.&nbsp;</p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\">While the Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone started out focusing on a single block -- West 119th Street -- it has since expanded exponentially. It now encompasses more than 100 square blocks and serves an estimated 10,000 children, providing pre-kindergarten care, after-school programs, health care, college planning and classes for soon-to-be-parents. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Meanwhile, Canada has become known nationally for his work, appearing on shows as diverse as <em>Oprah </em>and <em>This American Life</em>. The recipient of the first Heinz Award in 1994, Canada was named one of &quot;America&#39;s Best Leaders&quot; by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> in 2005 and, in 2011, he was listed as one of TIME magazine&rsquo;s 100 most influential people in the world. Both Canada and Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone figured prominently in the 2010 documentary <em>Waiting for Superman</em>. And President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Promise Neighborhoods program was modeled after HCZ, offering grants to programs in 21 cities across the country to try and emulate its success.</p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\">An avid fan and teacher of Tae Kwon Do, Canada has authored two books:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/fiststickknifegun\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fist Stick Knife Gun: A Personal History of Violence in America</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/reachingup\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reaching Up for Manhood: Transforming the Lives of Boys in America</em></a>.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/geoffrey_canada_our_failing_schools_enough_is_enough","viewed_count":1950322,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"Why, why, why does our education system look so similar to the way it did 50 years ago?

Its after-school college advice office has helped place 650 students in college, and it supports them until they graduate ... Mr. Canada has achieved superhero status among those who admire him for his vision.\r\n","whotheyare":"Geoffrey Canada has spent decades as head of the Harlem Children’s Zone, which supports kids from birth through college in order to break the cycle of poverty.","whylisten":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Geoffrey Canada grew up in an impoverished neighborhood in the South Bronx, with a mother who believed deeply in education. So upon getting his degree from Bowdoin College and continuing on to a masters in education from Harvard, Canada dedicated himself to working with kids in poor neighborhoods. In 1983, he accepted a position at the Rheedlen Institute in Harlem as education director. Seven years later, he became president and renamed it the Harlem Children&#39;s Zone.&nbsp;</p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\">While the Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone started out focusing on a single block -- West 119th Street -- it has since expanded exponentially. It now encompasses more than 100 square blocks and serves an estimated 10,000 children, providing pre-kindergarten care, after-school programs, health care, college planning and classes for soon-to-be-parents. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Meanwhile, Canada has become known nationally for his work, appearing on shows as diverse as <em>Oprah </em>and <em>This American Life</em>. The recipient of the first Heinz Award in 1994, Canada was named one of &quot;America&#39;s Best Leaders&quot; by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> in 2005 and, in 2011, he was listed as one of TIME magazine&rsquo;s 100 most influential people in the world. Both Canada and Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone figured prominently in the 2010 documentary <em>Waiting for Superman</em>. And President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Promise Neighborhoods program was modeled after HCZ, offering grants to programs in 21 cities across the country to try and emulate its success.</p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\">An avid fan and teacher of Tae Kwon Do, Canada has authored two books:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/fiststickknifegun\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fist Stick Knife Gun: A Personal History of Violence in America</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/reachingup\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reaching Up for Manhood: Transforming the Lives of Boys in America</em></a>.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Geoffrey Canada","tags":["business","children","education"],"title":"Our failing schools.
