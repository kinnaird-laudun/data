											So since I was here last in &#39;06,
											we discovered that global climate change
											is turning out to be a pretty serious issue,
											so we covered that fairly extensively
											in Skeptic magazine.
											We investigate all kinds
											of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,
											but it turns out we don&#39;t have to worry about any of this
											because the world&#39;s going to end in 2012.

											Another update:
											You will recall I introduced you guys
											to the Quadro Tracker.
											It&#39;s like a water dowsing device.
											It&#39;s just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.
											And you walk around, and it points to things.
											Like if you&#39;re looking for marijuana in students&#39; lockers,
											it&#39;ll point right to somebody.
											Oh, sorry. (Laughter)
											This particular one that was given to me
											finds golf balls,
											especially if you&#39;re at a golf course
											and you check under enough bushes.
											Well, under the category of &quot;What&#39;s the harm of silly stuff like this?&quot;
											this device, the ADE 651,
											was sold to the Iraqi government
											for 40,000 dollars apiece.
											It&#39;s just like this one, completely worthless,
											in which it allegedly worked by &quot;electrostatic
											magnetic ion attraction,&quot;
											which translates to
											&quot;pseudoscientific baloney&quot; — would be the nice word —
											in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,
											but it does absolutely nothing.
											In this case, at trespass points,
											allowing people to go through
											because your little tracker device said they were okay,
											actually cost lives.
											So there is a danger to pseudoscience,
											in believing in this sort of thing.

											So what I want to talk about today is belief.
											I want to believe,
											and you do too.
											And in fact, I think my thesis here is that
											belief is the natural state of things.
											It is the default option. We just believe.
											We believe all sorts of things.
											Belief is natural;
											disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.
											It&#39;s more difficult.
											It&#39;s uncomfortable to not believe things.
											So like Fox Mulder on &quot;X-Files,&quot;
											who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,
											and the reason for that is because
											we have a belief engine in our brains.
											Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.
											We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.
											And sometimes A really is connected to B,
											and that&#39;s called association learning.

											We find patterns, we make those connections,
											whether it&#39;s Pavlov&#39;s dog here
											associating the sound of the bell with the food,
											and then he salivates to the sound of the bell,
											or whether it&#39;s a Skinnerian rat,
											in which he&#39;s having an association
											between his behavior and a reward for it,
											and therefore he repeats the behavior.
											In fact, what Skinner discovered
											is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,
											and he has to press one of these two keys,
											and he tries to figure out what the pattern is,
											and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there —
											if you just randomly assign rewards
											such that there is no pattern,
											they will figure out any kind of pattern.
											And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,
											they repeat that particular pattern.
											Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,
											once clockwise and peck the key twice.
											And that&#39;s called superstition,
											and that, I&#39;m afraid,
											we will always have with us.

											I call this process &quot;patternicity&quot; —
											that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns
											in both meaningful and meaningless noise.
											When we do this process, we make two types of errors.
											A Type I error, or false positive,
											is believing a pattern is real
											when it&#39;s not.
											Our second type of error is a false negative.
											A Type II error is not believing
											a pattern is real when it is.
											So let&#39;s do a thought experiment.
											You are a hominid three million years ago
											walking on the plains of Africa.
											Your name is Lucy, okay?
											And you hear a rustle in the grass.
											Is it a dangerous predator,
											or is it just the wind?
											Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.
											Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator
											and it turns out it&#39;s just the wind,
											you&#39;ve made an error in cognition,
											made a Type I error, false positive.
											But no harm. You just move away.
											You&#39;re more cautious. You&#39;re more vigilant.
											On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,
											and it turns out it&#39;s a dangerous predator,
											you&#39;re lunch.
											You&#39;ve just won a Darwin award.
											You&#39;ve been taken out of the gene pool.

											Now the problem here is that
											patternicities will occur whenever the cost
											of making a Type I error
											is less than the cost of making a Type II error.
											This is the only equation in the talk by the way.
											We have a pattern detection problem
											that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error
											is highly problematic,
											especially in split-second, life-and-death situations.
											So the default position
											is just: Believe all patterns are real —
											All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators
											and not just the wind.
											And so I think that we evolved ...
											there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,
											our pattern-seeking brain processes,
											to always find meaningful patterns
											and infuse them with these sort of
											predatory or intentional agencies that I&#39;ll come back to.

											So for example, what do you see here?
											It&#39;s a horse head, that&#39;s right.
											It looks like a horse. It must be a horse.
											That&#39;s a pattern.
											And is it really a horse?
											Or is it more like a frog?
											See, our pattern detection device,
											which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex —
											it&#39;s our little detection device there —
											can be easily fooled, and this is the problem.
											For example, what do you see here?
											Yes, of course, it&#39;s a cow.
											Once I prime the brain — it&#39;s called cognitive priming —
											once I prime the brain to see it,
											it pops back out again even without the pattern that I&#39;ve imposed on it.
											And what do you see here?
											Some people see a Dalmatian dog.
											Yes, there it is. And there&#39;s the prime.
											So when I go back without the prime,
											your brain already has the model
											so you can see it again.
											What do you see here?
											Planet Saturn. Yes, that&#39;s good.

											This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson
											at U.T. Austin
											on corporate environments
											and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control
											makes people see illusory patterns.
											That is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.
											People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control
											are more likely to see something in this,
											which is allegedly patternless.
											In other words, the propensity to find these patterns
											goes up when there&#39;s a lack of control.
											For example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious
											when they&#39;re batting,
											but not so much when they&#39;re fielding.
											Because fielders are successful
											90 to 95 percent of the time.
											The best batters fail seven out of 10 times.
											So their superstitions, their patternicities,

											What do you see in this particular one here, in this field?

											There actually is something here,

											While you&#39;re thinking about that,
											this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,
											a psychologist in England,
											who showed subjects this degraded image
											and then ran a correlation between
											their scores on an ESP test:
											How much did they believe in the paranormal,
											supernatural, angels and so forth.
											And those who scored high on the ESP scale,
											tended to not only see
											more patterns in the degraded images
											but incorrect patterns.
											Here is what you show subjects.
											The fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent

											A similar experiment was done by another [Swiss] psychologist

											So if you present subjects the images such
											that it&#39;s going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,
											then they&#39;re more likely to see patterns
											than if you put it on the left hemisphere.
											Our right hemisphere appears to be
											where a lot of this patternicity occurs.
											So what we&#39;re trying to do is bore into the brain

											Brugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr,
											gave subjects L-DOPA.
											L-DOPA&#39;s a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson&#39;s disease,
											which is related to a decrease in dopamine.
											L-DOPA increases dopamine.
											An increase of dopamine caused
											subjects to see more patterns
											than those that did not receive the dopamine.
											So dopamine appears to be the drug
											associated with patternicity.
											In fact, neuroleptic drugs
											that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,
											things like paranoia, delusions
											and hallucinations,
											these are patternicities.
											They&#39;re incorrect patterns. They&#39;re false positives. They&#39;re Type I errors.
											And if you give them drugs
											that are dopamine antagonists,
											they go away.
											That is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,
											and their tendency to see
											patterns like that decreases.
											On the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine
											are dopamine agonists.
											They increase the amount of dopamine.
											So you&#39;re more likely to feel in a euphoric state,
											creativity, find more patterns.

											In fact, I saw Robin Williams recently

											So perhaps more dopamine
											is related to more creativity.
											Dopamine, I think, changes
											our signal-to-noise ratio.
											That is, how accurate we are
											in finding patterns.
											If it&#39;s too low, you&#39;re more likely to make too many Type II errors.
											You miss the real patterns. You don&#39;t want to be too skeptical.
											If you&#39;re too skeptical, you&#39;ll miss the really interesting good ideas.
											Just right, you&#39;re creative, and yet you don&#39;t fall for too much baloney.
											Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.
											Every time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.
											You think people are talking about you.
											And if you go too far on that, that&#39;s just simply
											labeled as madness.
											It&#39;s a distinction perhaps we might make
											between two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman
											and John Nash.
											One sees maybe just the right number

											that they&#39;re coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.

											as this super intelligent, moral being
											that comes down to design life.
											Even the idea that government can rescue us —

Along with publishing Skeptic Magazine, he's author of Why People Believe Weird Things and The Mind of the Market.","whylisten":"<p>As founder and publisher of <a href=\"http://www.skeptic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Skeptic Magazine</em></a>, Michael Shermer has exposed fallacies behind intelligent design, 9/11 conspiracies, the low-carb craze, alien sightings and other popular beliefs and paranoias. But it&#39;s not about debunking for debunking&#39;s sake. Shermer defends the notion that we can understand our world better only by matching good theory with good science. <br /><br />Shermer&#39;s work offers cognitive context for our often misguided beliefs: In the absence of sound science, incomplete information can powerfully combine with the power of suggestion (helping us hear Satanic lyrics when &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; plays backwards, for example). In fact, a common thread that runs through beliefs of all sorts, he says, is our tendency to convince ourselves: We overvalue the shreds of evidence that support our preferred outcome, and ignore the facts we aren&#39;t looking for.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He writes a monthly column for <em>Scientific American</em>, and is an adjunct at Claremont Graduate University and Chapman University. His latest book is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/believingbrain\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies&mdash;How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths</em></a>.

life.","whotheyare":"Michael Shermer debunks myths, superstitions and urban legends -- and explains why we believe them. Along with publishing Skeptic Magazine, he's author of Why People Believe Weird Things and The Mind of the Market.","whylisten":"<p>As founder and publisher of <a href=\"http://www.skeptic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Skeptic Magazine</em></a>, Michael Shermer has exposed fallacies behind intelligent design, 9/11 conspiracies, the low-carb craze, alien sightings and other popular beliefs and paranoias. But it&#39;s not about debunking for debunking&#39;s sake. Shermer defends the notion that we can understand our world better only by matching good theory with good science. <br /><br />Shermer&#39;s work offers cognitive context for our often misguided beliefs: In the absence of sound science, incomplete information can powerfully combine with the power of suggestion (helping us hear Satanic lyrics when &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; plays backwards, for example). In fact, a common thread that runs through beliefs of all sorts, he says, is our tendency to convince ourselves: We overvalue the shreds of evidence that support our preferred outcome, and ignore the facts we aren&#39;t looking for.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He writes a monthly column for <em>Scientific American</em>, and is an adjunct at Claremont Graduate University and Chapman University. His latest book is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/believingbrain\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies&mdash;How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths</em></a>. He is also the author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/mindofmarket\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Mind of the Market</em></a><em>,</em> on evolutionary economics,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/whydarwinmatters\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why Darwin Matters: Evolution and the Case Against Intelligent Design</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/scienceofgoodevil\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Science of Good and Evil</em></a>.
