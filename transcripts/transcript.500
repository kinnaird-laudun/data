											Most of the time, art and science stare at each other
											across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.
											There is great confusion when the two look at each other.
											Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche,
											the emotions — the unconscious at times — and of course the aesthetic.
											Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative —
											things that can be measured and described —
											but it gives art a terrific context of understanding.

											In the Extreme Ice Survey,

											Specifically, I as a person
											who&#39;s been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life,
											am firmly of the belief that photography, video, film
											have tremendous powers for helping us understand
											and shape the way we think about nature
											and about ourselves in relationship to nature.

											In this project, we&#39;re specifically interested, of course, in ice.
											I&#39;m fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it,
											the malleability of it,
											and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.
											These first images are from Greenland.
											But ice has another meaning.
											Ice is the canary in the global coal mine.
											It&#39;s the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action.

											Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world.
											Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of
											is it raining more or is it raining less?
											Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder?
											What do the computer models say about this, that and the other thing?
											All of that, strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments,
											where the ice is, it&#39;s real and it&#39;s present.
											The changes are happening. They&#39;re very visible.
											They&#39;re photographable. They&#39;re measurable.

											95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking.
											That&#39;s outside Antarctica.
											95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking,
											and that&#39;s because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing.
											There is no significant scientific dispute about that.
											It&#39;s been observed, it&#39;s measured, it&#39;s bomb-proof information.
											And the great irony and tragedy of our time
											is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.
											Science is not arguing about that.
											In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers,
											ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old
											breaking up into chunks, and chunk by chunk by chunk,
											iceberg by iceberg, turning into global sea level rise.

											So, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career,
											I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago,
											because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models.
											I hadn&#39;t realized it was based on concrete measurements
											of what the paleoclimates — the ancient climates — were,
											as recorded in the ice sheets, as recorded in deep ocean sediments,
											as recorded in lake sediments, tree rings,
											and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature.

									<p>
											When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models,
											I decided that one day I would do a project
											looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.
											And that led me to this project.
											Initially, I was working on a National Geographic assignment —
											conventional, single frame, still photography.
											And one crazy day, I got the idea that I should —
											after that assignment was finished —
											I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography,
											that I should station a camera or two at a glacier
											and let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever
											and watch the progression of the landscape over time.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, within about three weeks,
											I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras
											into 25 time-lapse cameras.
											And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career,
											trying to design, build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras.
											They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them.
											Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer
											that tells the camera when to fire.
											And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers,
											and they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions,
											and they watch the evolution of the landscape.
											We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.
											We actually drilled holes into the ice, way deep down below the thawing level,
											and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so.
											Actually, there&#39;s still a camera out there right now.
											In any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour.
											Some of them shoot every half hour, every 15 minutes, every five minutes.

											as much as possible with these pictures as well.
											We&#39;ve done films. We&#39;ve done books. We have more coming.
											We have a site on Google Earth

											Number one: temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
											go up and down basically in sync.
											You can see that from the orange line and the blue line.
											Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.
											That&#39;s the natural cycle.

											In the past hundred years, the temperature of the Earth

											We&#39;re now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska.
											This is a view of what&#39;s called the calving face.
											This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.
											You see the glacier flowing in from the right,
											dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour.
											If you look in the middle background,
											you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.
											That means that glacier&#39;s floating and it&#39;s unstable,
											and you&#39;re about to see the consequences of that floating.
											To give you a little bit of a sense of scale,
											that calving face in this picture
											is about 325 feet tall. That&#39;s 32 stories.
											This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.
											The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off,
											but in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.
											So there&#39;s a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep
											going down to bedrock if the glacier&#39;s grounded on bedrock,
											and floating if it isn&#39;t.

											Here&#39;s what Columbia&#39;s done. This is in south central Alaska.
											This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.
											This is an aerial picture we did this year.
											That&#39;s the retreat of this glacier.
											The main stem, the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right
											and it&#39;s going very rapidly up that stem.
											We&#39;re going to be up there in just a few more weeks,
											and we expect that it&#39;s probably retreated another half a mile,
											but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed
											and it was five miles further back, I wouldn&#39;t be the least bit surprised.

											Now it&#39;s really hard to grasp the scale of these places,
											because as the glaciers —
											one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge,
											they&#39;re not normal landscapes —
											but as the glaciers are retreating, they&#39;re also deflating,
											like air is being let out of a balloon.
											And so, there are features on this landscape.
											There&#39;s a ridge right in the middle of the picture, up above where that arrow comes in,
											that shows you that a little bit.
											There&#39;s a marker line called the trim line
											above our little red illustration there.
											This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do —
											you put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? —
											and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.
											But, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984
											has been higher than the Eiffel Tower, higher than the Empire State Building.

											A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys
											as it&#39;s retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.
											These changes in the alpine world are accelerating.
											It&#39;s not static.
											Particularly in the world of sea ice,
											the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago,
											and the processes either are accelerating
											or the predictions were too low to begin with.

											A 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.

											Okay, how big was that? It&#39;s hard to get it.
											So an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.
											A mile of retreat in 75 minutes
											across the calving face, in that particular event, three miles wide.
											The block was three-fifths of a mile deep,
											and if you compare the expanse of the calving face
											to the Tower Bridge in London, about 20 bridges wide.
											Or if you take an American reference, to the U.S. Capitol Building

											Now I&#39;ve come to the conclusion

											The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues,

											I&#39;m certain that we can.
											But what we have is a perception problem
											because not enough people really get it yet.
											You&#39;re an elite audience. You get it.
											Fortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world
											are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.
											But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.

","whylisten":"<p>To see the natural world through James Balog&#39;s lens is to see it as an artist would -- through fresh eyes, as if for the first time, with no preconceived notions. His photos of jungle animals, for instance, are arresting in their directness, simplicity, even sensuality. His subjects assume the same weight and importance as a human portrait sitter, and demand (as a human subject would) that the viewer engage with them rather than simply spectate. <br /><br />His newest work is no less powerful, no less engaging -- and it carries an urgent message. For several years, Balog has been going up north to shoot the half-alive ice of the mammoth glaciers for his Extreme Ice Survey, a look at the shocking effects of abrupt climate change in Alaska, Greenland and Iceland. Soaring, dripping, glowing and crumbling, arctic ice under Balog&#39;s eye requires the viewer to engage. <br /><br />A new Nova/PBS TV special and a new book,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/extremeicenow\" target=\"_blank\">Extreme Ice Now</a>,</em>&nbsp;are helping him spread the word that this glorious world is degrading at a speed we couldn&#39;t imagine until we saw it through his eyes.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"James Balog","tags":["climate change","global issues","photography","science","technology"],"title":"Time-lapse proof of extreme ice loss","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":954795}]}
