											I am a writer.
											Writing books is my profession
but it&#39;s more than that, of course.
											It is also my great lifelong
love and fascination.
											And I don&#39;t expect
that that&#39;s ever going to change.
											But, that said, something
kind of peculiar has happened recently
											in my life and in my career,
											which has caused me to have to recalibrate
my whole relationship with this work.
											And the peculiar thing
is that I recently wrote this book,
											this memoir called &quot;Eat, Pray, Love&quot;
											which, decidedly
unlike any of my previous books,
											went out in the world
for some reason, and became this big,
											mega-sensation, international
bestseller thing.
											The result of which
is that everywhere I go now,
											people treat me like I&#39;m doomed.
											Seriously — doomed, doomed!
											Like, they come up to me now,
all worried, and they say,
											&quot;Aren&#39;t you afraid you&#39;re never
going to be able to top that?
											Aren&#39;t you afraid you&#39;re going
to keep writing for your whole life
											and you&#39;re never again
going to create a book
											that anybody in the world
cares about at all,
											ever again?&quot;

											So that&#39;s reassuring, you know.
											But it would be worse,
except for that I happen to remember
											that over 20 years ago,
when I was a teenager,
											when I first started telling people
that I wanted to be a writer,
											I was met with this same
sort of fear-based reaction.
											And people would say, &quot;Aren&#39;t you afraid
you&#39;re never going to have any success?
											Aren&#39;t you afraid the humiliation
of rejection will kill you?
											Aren&#39;t you afraid that you&#39;re going
to work your whole life at this craft
											and nothing&#39;s ever going to come of it
											and you&#39;re going to die
on a scrap heap of broken dreams
											with your mouth filled
with bitter ash of failure?&quot;

											The answer — the short answer
to all those questions is, &quot;Yes.&quot;
											Yes, I&#39;m afraid of all those things.
											And I always have been.
											And I&#39;m afraid of many,
many more things besides
											that people can&#39;t even guess at,
											like seaweed and other
things that are scary.
											But, when it comes to writing,
											the thing that I&#39;ve been sort of thinking
about lately, and wondering about lately,
											is why?
											You know, is it rational?
											Is it logical that anybody
should be expected
											to be afraid of the work that they feel
they were put on this Earth to do.
											And what is it specifically
about creative ventures
											that seems to make us really nervous
about each other&#39;s mental health
											in a way that other careers
kind of don&#39;t do, you know?
											Like my dad, for example,
was a chemical engineer
											and I don&#39;t recall once in his 40 years
of chemical engineering
											anybody asking him if he was afraid
to be a chemical engineer, you know?
											&quot;That chemical-engineering block,
John, how&#39;s it going?&quot;
											It just didn&#39;t come up
like that, you know?
											But to be fair,
chemical engineers as a group
											haven&#39;t really earned
a reputation over the centuries
											for being alcoholic manic-depressives.

											We writers, we kind of do have

to believe that creativity

											People believed that creativity
was this divine attendant spirit
											that came to human beings
from some distant and unknowable source,
											for distant and unknowable reasons.
											The Greeks famously called these divine
attendant spirits of creativity &quot;daemons.&quot;

											They believed that a genius was this,
sort of magical divine entity,
											who was believed to literally
live in the walls of an artist&#39;s studio,

too much narcissism, right?

at the center of the universe

											I had this encounter recently
											where I met the extraordinary
American poet Ruth Stone,
											who&#39;s now in her 90s,
but she&#39;s been a poet her entire life
											and she told me that when
she was growing up in rural Virginia,
											she would be out working in the fields,
											and she said she would feel
and hear a poem
											coming at her from over the landscape.
											And she said it was like
a thunderous train of air.
											And it would come barreling down
at her over the landscape.
											And she felt it coming, because it
would shake the earth under her feet.
											She knew that she had
only one thing to do at that point,
											and that was to,
in her words, &quot;run like hell.&quot;
											And she would run like hell to the house
											and she would be getting
chased by this poem,
											and the whole deal was that she had
to get to a piece of paper and a pencil
											fast enough so that when it thundered
through her, she could collect it
											and grab it on the page.
											And other times
she wouldn&#39;t be fast enough,
											so she&#39;d be running and running,
and she wouldn&#39;t get to the house
											and the poem would barrel
through her and she would miss it
											and she said it would continue
on across the landscape,
											looking, as she put it &quot;for another poet.&quot;
											And then there were these times —
											this is the piece I never forgot —
											she said that there were moments
where she would almost miss it, right?
											So, she&#39;s running to the house
and she&#39;s looking for the paper
											and the poem passes through her,
											and she grabs a pencil just
as it&#39;s going through her,
											and then she said, it was like
she would reach out with her other hand
											and she would catch it.
											She would catch the poem by its tail,
											and she would pull it
backwards into her body
											as she was transcribing on the page.
											And in these instances, the poem would
come up on the page perfect and intact
											but backwards, from the last
word to the first.

											And when this happened, back then,
											people knew it for what it was,
you know, they called it by its name.
											They would put their hands together
and they would start to chant,
											&quot;Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God.&quot;
											That&#39;s God, you know.
											Curious historical footnote:
											when the Moors invaded southern Spain,
they took this custom with them
											and the pronunciation
changed over the centuries
											from &quot;Allah, Allah, Allah,&quot;
to &quot;Olé, olé, olé,&quot;
											which you still hear in bullfights
and in flamenco dances.
											In Spain, when a performer has done
something impossible and magic,
											&quot;Allah, olé, olé, Allah,
magnificent, bravo,&quot;
											incomprehensible, there it is
— a glimpse of God.
											Which is great, because we need that.

											But, the tricky bit
comes the next morning,
											for the dancer himself,
when he wakes up and discovers
											that it&#39;s Tuesday at 11 a.m.,
and he&#39;s no longer a glimpse of God.
											He&#39;s just an aging mortal
with really bad knees,
											and maybe he&#39;s never going
to ascend to that height again.
											And maybe nobody will ever chant
God&#39;s name again as he spins,
											and what is he then to do
with the rest of his life?
											This is hard.
											This is one of the most painful
reconciliations to make
											in a creative life.
											But maybe it doesn&#39;t have to be
quite so full of anguish
											if you never happened
to believe, in the first place,
											that the most extraordinary aspects
of your being came from you.
											But maybe if you just believed
that they were on loan to you
											from some unimaginable source
for some exquisite portion of your life
											to be passed along when you&#39;re finished,
											with somebody else.
											And, you know, if we think about it
this way, it starts to change everything.

											And what I have to
sort of keep telling myself
											when I get really psyched out
about that is don&#39;t be afraid.
											Don&#39;t be daunted. Just do your job.
											Continue to show up for your piece of it,
whatever that might be.
											If your job is to dance, do your dance.
											If the divine, cockeyed genius
assigned to your case
											decides to let some sort of wonderment
be glimpsed, for just one moment
											through your efforts, then &quot;Olé!&quot;
											And if not, do your dance anyhow.
											And &quot;Olé!&quot; to you, nonetheless.
											I believe this and I feel
that we must teach it.

human love and stubbornness

Her books include the story collection&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/pilgrims\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pilgrims</em></a>, the novel&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/sternmen\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Stern Men</em></a>&nbsp;(about lobster fishermen in Maine) and a biography of the woodsman Eustace Conway, called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/lastamericanman\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Last American Man</em></a>. Her work has been the basis for two movies so far (<em>Coyote Ugly</em>, based on her own tale of working at the famously raunchy bar in New York City), and <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em>, with the part of Gilbert played by Julia Roberts. Not bad for a year off. </p><p>In 2010, Elizabeth published <em>Committed</em>, a memoir exploring her ambivalent feelings about the institution of marriage. And her 2013 novel,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/signatureofallthings\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Signature of All Things</em></a><em>,</em> is &quot;a sprawling tale of 19th century botanical exploration.&quot;</p><p>Gilbert also owns and runs the import shop Two Buttons in Frenchtown, New Jersey.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Elizabeth Gilbert","tags":["creativity","culture","entertainment","poetry","work","writing","personality"],"title":"Your elusive creative genius","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":14838477}]}
