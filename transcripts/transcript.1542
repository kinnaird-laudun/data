<title>Gary Slutkin: Let&#39;s treat violence like a contagious disease | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Dr. Gary Slutkin spent a decade fighting tuberculosis, cholera and AIDS epidemics in Africa. When he returned to the US, he thought he&#39;d escape brutal epidemic deaths. But he began to look more carefully at gun violence -- whose spread follows the same pattern as an infectious disease. His conclusion: We&#39;ve reversed the impact of so many diseases, says Slutkin, and we can do the same with violence. A mind-flipping look at a problem that too many communities have accepted as a given. " />

<meta content="Dr. Gary Slutkin spent a decade fighting tuberculosis, cholera and AIDS epidemics in Africa. When he returned to the US, he thought he'd escape brutal epidemic deaths. But he began to look more carefully at gun violence — whose spread follows the same pattern as an infectious disease. His conclusion: We've reversed the impact of so many diseases, says Slutkin, and we can do the same with violence. A mind-flipping look at a problem that too many communities have accepted as a given. " itemprop='description'>

											But I landed in a refugee situation
											that had a million refugees in 40 camps,
											and there were six of us doctors.
											There were many epidemics there.
											My responsibilities were largely related to
											tuberculosis,
											and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.
											So it was the spread of tuberculosis
											and the spread of cholera
											that I was responsible for inhibiting.
											And in order to do this work, we, of course,
											because of the limitation in health workers,
											had to recruit refugees to be a specialized
											new category of health worker.
											Following three years of work in Somalia,
											I got picked up by the World Health Organization,
											and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.
											My primary responsibility was Uganda,
											but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi
											and Zaire, now Congo,
											Tanzania, Malawi, and several other countries.
											And my last assignment there was to run a unit
											called intervention development,
											which was responsible for designing interventions.

											I&#39;d seen a lot of death,

											and epidemic death has a different feel to it.
											It&#39;s full of panic and fear,

											How many of you have such a situation?

											And one was punishment.
											And this I had heard about before.
											We who had worked in behavior
											knew that punishment was something that was discussed
											but also that it was highly overvalued.
											It was not a main driver of behavior,
											nor was it a main driver of behavior change.
											And besides that, it reminded me
											of ancient epidemics
											that were previously completely misunderstood
											because the science hadn&#39;t been there before,
											epidemics of plague
											or typhus or leprosy,
											where the prevalent ideas were that there were
											bad people or bad humors or bad air,
											and widows were dragged around the moat,
											and dungeons were part of the solution.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The other explanation or, in a way,
											the solution suggested,
											is please fix all of these things:
											the schools, the community, the homes, the families,
											everything.
											And I&#39;d heard this before as well.
											I&#39;d called this the &quot;everything&quot; theory,
											or EOE: Everything On Earth.
											But we&#39;d also realized
											in treating other processes and problems
											that sometimes you don&#39;t need to treat everything.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so the sense that I had
											was there was a giant gap here.
											The problem of violence was stuck,
											and this has historically been the case
											in many other issues.
											Diarrheal diseases had been stuck.
											Malaria had been stuck.
											Frequently, a strategy has to be rethought.
											It&#39;s not as if I had any idea what it would look like,
											but there was a sense that we would have to do
											something with new categories of workers
											and something having to do with behavior change
											and something having to do with public education.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But I began to ask questions
											and search out the usual things
											that I had been exploring before,
											like, what do the maps look like?
											What do the graphs look like?
											What does the data look like?
											And the maps of violence
											in most U.S. cities
											looked like this.
											There was clustering.
											This reminded me of clustering that we&#39;d seen also
											in infectious epidemics,
											for example cholera.
											And then we looked at the maps,
											and the maps showed this typical wave
											upon wave upon wave,
											because all epidemics
											are combinations of many epidemics.
											And it also looked like infectious epidemics.
											And then we asked the question,
											well what really predicts a case of violence?
											And it turns out that the greatest predictor
											of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.
											Which also sounds like, if there is a case of flu,
											someone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold,
											or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis
											is having been exposed to tuberculosis.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so we see that violence is, in a way,
											behaving like a contagious disease.
											We&#39;re aware of this anyway
											even in our common experiences
											or our newspaper stories
											of the spread of violence from fights
											or in gang wars or in civil wars
											or even in genocides.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so there&#39;s good news about this, though,
											because there&#39;s a way to reverse epidemics,
											and there&#39;s really only three things that are done
											to reverse epidemics,
											and the first of it is interrupting transmission.
											In order to interrupt transmission,
											you need to detect and find first cases.
											In other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody
											who has active T.B. who is infecting other people.
											Make sense?
											And there&#39;s special workers for doing that.
											For this particular problem,
											we designed a new category of worker
											who, like a SARS worker
											or someone looking for bird flu,
											might find first cases.
											In this case, it&#39;s someone who&#39;s very angry
											because someone looked at his girlfriend
											or owes him money,
											and you can find workers and train them
											into these specialized categories.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And the second thing to do, of course,
											is to prevent further spread,
											that means to find who else has been exposed,
											but may not be spreading so much right now
											like someone with a smaller case of T.B.,
											or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods,
											but in the same group,
											and then they need to be, in a way,
											managed as well,
											particular to the specific disease process.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then the third part, the shifting the norms,
											and that means a whole bunch of community activities,
											remodeling, public education,
											and then you&#39;ve got what you might call
											group immunity.
											And that combination of factors
											is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda
											was very successfully reversed.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so what we decided to do in the year 2000
											is kind of put this together in a way
											by hiring in new categories of workers,
											the first being violence interruptors.
											And then we would put all of this into place
											in one neighborhood
											in what was the worst police district
											in the United States at the time.
											So violence interruptors hired from the same group,
											credibility, trust, access,
											just like the health workers in Somalia,
											but designed for a different category,
											and trained in persuasion,
											cooling people down, buying time, reframing.
											And then another category of worker,
											the outreach workers, to keep people
											in a way on therapy for six to 24 months.
											Just like T.B., but the object is behavior change.
											And then a bunch of community activities
											for changing norms.

									<p>
											And this was a beautiful thing
											for the neighborhood itself,
											first 50 or 60 days, then 90 days,
											and then there was unfortunately another shooting
											in another 90 days,
											and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.
											They were using parks they weren&#39;t using before.

									<p>
											But of course, the funders said, &quot;Wait a second,
											do it again.&quot;
											And so we had to then, fortunately,
											get the funds to repeat this experience,
											and this is one of the next four neighborhoods
											that had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings.
											And since that time, this has been replicated
											20 times.
											There have been independent evaluations
											supported by the Justice Department
											and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins
											that have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent
											reductions in shootings and killings
											using this new method.
											In fact, there have been three independent

											Now we&#39;ve gotten a lot of attention as a result of this,
											including being featured on

									<p>
											However, not so fast,
											because a lot of people did not agree
											with this way of going about it.
											We got a lot of criticism,
											a lot of opposition,
											and a lot of opponents.
											In other words, what do you mean, health problem?
											What do you mean, epidemic?
											What do you mean, no bad guys?
											And there&#39;s whole industries designed
											for managing bad people.
											What do you mean, hiring people

											So anyway, additionally,
											there was still this problem,

											So what&#39;s actually happened is,
											although there is still some opposition,
											the movement is clearly growing.
											Many of the major cities in the U.S.,
											including New York City and Baltimore
											and Kansas City,
											their health departments are running this now.
											Chicago and New Orleans, the health departments
											are having a very large role in this.
											This is being embraced more by law enforcement
											than it had been years ago.
											Trauma centers and hospitals
											are doing their part in stepping up.
											And the U.S. Conference of Mayors
											has endorsed not only the approach
											but the specific model.
											Where there&#39;s really been uptake even faster
											is in the international environment,
											where there&#39;s a 55-percent drop
											in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico,
											where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras,
											where the strategy has been applied in Kenya
											for the recent elections,
											and where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq.

											So violence is responding as a disease
											even as it behaves as a disease.
											So the theory, in a way,
											is kind of being validated by the treatment.
											And recently, the Institute of Medicine
											came out with a workshop report
											which went through some of the data,
											including the neuroscience,
											on how this problem is really transmitted.

									<p>
											So I think this is good news,
											because it allows us an opportunity
											to come out of the Middle Ages,
											which is where I feel this field has been.
											It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility
											of replacing some of these prisons
											with playgrounds or parks,
											and to consider the possibility
											of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods,
											and to allow there to be a new strategy,
											a new set of methods, a new set of workers:
											science, in a way, replacing morality.
											And moving away from emotions
											is the most important part of the solution
											to science as a more important part of the solution.

											So I didn&#39;t mean to come up with this at all.
											It was a matter of,
											I wanted actually a break,
											and we looked at maps, we looked at graphs,
											we asked some questions
											and tried some tools
											that actually have been used many times before
											for other things.
											For myself, I tried to get away from

As the director of the initiative Cure Violence, Gary Slutkin approaches gunfire on neighborhood streets as a contagious disease, looking to science and public health for strategies to stop it.\r\n","whylisten":"<p>Gary Slutkin is an epidemiologist, an innovator in violence reduction, and the Founder/Executive Director of Cure Violence, formerly known as CeaseFire. As a physician, he began his career working in Somalian refugee camps, where tuberculosis and cholera epidemics flared up regularly. He went on to work for the World Health Organization on reversing epidemics, supporting Uganda&rsquo;s AIDS program which helped the country reversed the course of the disease. Upon returning to the United States, it occurred to him: could gun violence function like an epidemic? And could it be fought, and even stopped, using the principles of public health?</p> <p>Slutkin has applied the lessons learned over a decade of fighting epidemics to the creation of Cure Violence, a public health approach that has been statistically validated by two independent evaluations by the Department of Justice and Centers for Disease Control. Cure Violence has been called a &quot;pioneering violence reduction model&quot; and its methods have received nods from the Institute of Medicine and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The program is being replicated at more than 50 sites in 15 U.S. cities, as well as in many countries abroad.</p> <p>Dr. Sultkin is an Ashoka Fellow, a Professor of Epidemiology and International Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and a senior advisor to the World Health Organization.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Gary Slutkin","tags":["disease","health","medicine","violence"],"title":"Let's treat violence like a contagious disease","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":769326}]}
