											Today I want to tell you
											about a project being carried out
											by scientists all over the world
											to paint a neural portrait of the human mind.
											And the central idea of this work
											is that the human mind and brain
											is not a single, general-purpose processor,
											but a collection of highly specialized components,
											each solving a different specific problem,
											and yet collectively making up
											who we are as human beings and thinkers.
											To give you a feel for this idea,
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											imagine the following scenario:
											You walk into your child&#39;s day care center.
											As usual, there&#39;s a dozen kids there
											waiting to get picked up,
											but this time,
											the children&#39;s faces look weirdly similar,
											and you can&#39;t figure out which child is yours.
											Do you need new glasses?
											Are you losing your mind?
											You run through a quick mental checklist.
											No, you seem to be thinking clearly,
											and your vision is perfectly sharp.
											And everything looks normal
											except the children&#39;s faces.
											You can see the faces,
											but they don&#39;t look distinctive,
											and none of them looks familiar,
											and it&#39;s only by spotting an orange hair ribbon
											that you find your daughter.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces
											actually happens to people.
											It&#39;s called prosopagnosia,
											and it results from damage
											to a particular part of the brain.
											The striking thing about it
											is that only face recognition is impaired;
											everything else is just fine.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific
											mental deficits that can happen after brain damage.
											These syndromes collectively
											have suggested for a long time
											that the mind is divvied up into distinct components,
											but the effort to discover those components
											has jumped to warp speed
											with the invention of brain imaging technology,
											especially MRI.
											So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy
											at high resolution,
											so I&#39;m going to show you in a second
											a set of MRI cross-sectional images
											through a familiar object,
											and we&#39;re going to fly through them
											and you&#39;re going to try to figure out what the object is.
											Here we go.

											The really cool advance with functional imaging

											pictures that show not just anatomy but activity,
											that is, where neurons are firing.
											So here&#39;s how this works.
											Brains are like muscles.
											When they get active,
											they need increased blood flow to supply that activity,
											and lucky for us, blood flow
control to the brain is local,
											so if a bunch of neurons, say, right there
											get active and start firing,
											then blood flow increases just right there.
											So functional MRI picks up
on that blood flow increase,
											producing a higher MRI response
											where neural activity goes up.

									<p>
											So to give you a concrete feel
											for how a functional MRI experiment goes
											and what you can learn from it
											and what you can&#39;t,
											let me describe one of the first studies I ever did.
											We wanted to know if there was a special
part of the brain for recognizing faces,
											and there was already reason to
think there might be such a thing
											based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia
											that I described a moment ago,
											but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain
											in a normal person,
											so we set out to look for it.
											So I was the first subject.
											I went into the scanner, I lay on my back,
											I held my head as still as I could
											while staring at pictures of faces like these
											and objects like these
											and faces and objects for hours.
											So as somebody who has
pretty close to the world record
											of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner,
											I can tell you that one of the skills
											that&#39;s really important for MRI research
											is bladder control.
											(Laughter)
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											When I got out of the scanner,
											I did a quick analysis of the data,
											looking for any parts of my brain
											that produced a higher response
when I was looking at faces
											than when I was looking at objects,
											and here&#39;s what I saw.
											Now this image looks just awful by today&#39;s standards,
											but at the time I thought it was beautiful.
											What it shows is that region right there,
											that little blob,
											it&#39;s about the size of an olive
											and it&#39;s on the bottom surface of my brain
											about an inch straight in from right there.
											And what that part of my brain is doing
											is producing a higher MRI response,
											that is, higher neural activity,
											when I was looking at faces
											than when I was looking at objects.
											So that&#39;s pretty cool,
											but how do we know this isn&#39;t a fluke?
											Well, the easiest way
											is to just do the experiment again.
											So I got back in the scanner,
											I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects
											and I got a similar blob,
											and then I did it again
											and I did it again
											and again and again,
											and around about then
											I decided to believe it was for real.
											But still, maybe this is
something weird about my brain
											and no one else has one of these things in there,
											so to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people
											and found that pretty much everyone
											has that little face-processing region
											in a similar neighborhood of the brain.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the next question was,
											what does this thing really do?
											Is it really specialized just for face recognition?
											Well, maybe not, right?
											Maybe it responds not only to faces
											but to any body part.
											Maybe it responds to anything human
											or anything alive
											or anything round.
											The only way to be really sure that that region
											is specialized for face recognition
											is to rule out all of those hypotheses.
											So we spent much of the next couple of years
											scanning subjects while they looked at lots
											of different kinds of images,
											and we showed that that part of the brain
											responds strongly when you look at
											any images that are faces of any kind,
											and it responds much less strongly
											to any image you show that isn&#39;t a face,
											like some of these.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So have we finally nailed the case
											that this region is necessary for face recognition?
											No, we haven&#39;t.
											Brain imaging can never tell you
											if a region is necessary for anything.
											All you can do with brain imaging
											is watch regions turn on and off
											as people think different thoughts.
											To tell if a part of the brain is
necessary for a mental function,
											you need to mess with it and see what happens,
											and normally we don&#39;t get to do that.
											But an amazing opportunity came about
											very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine
											tested this man who has epilepsy
											and who is shown here in his hospital bed
											where he&#39;s just had electrodes placed
											on the surface of his brain
											to identify the source of his seizures.
											So it turned out by total chance
											that two of the electrodes
											happened to be right on top of his face area.
											So with the patient&#39;s consent,
											the doctors asked him what happened
											when they electrically stimulated
that part of his brain.
											Now, the patient doesn&#39;t know
											where those electrodes are,
											and he&#39;s never heard of the face area.
											So let&#39;s watch what happens.
											It&#39;s going to start with a control condition
											that will say &quot;Sham&quot; nearly invisibly
											in red in the lower left,
											when no current is delivered,
											and you&#39;ll hear the neurologist speaking
to the patient first. So let&#39;s watch.

											Nancy Kanwisher: So this experiment —
											(Applause) —
											this experiment finally nails the case
											that this region of the brain is not only
											selectively responsive to faces
											but causally involved in face perception.
											So I went through all of these details
											about the face region to show you what it takes
											to really establish that a part of the brain
											is selectively involved in a specific mental process.
											Next, I&#39;ll go through much more quickly
											some of the other specialized regions of the brain
											that we and others have found.
											So to do this, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time
											in the scanner over the last month
											so I can show you these things in my brain.

									<p>
											So let&#39;s get started. Here&#39;s my right hemisphere.
											So we&#39;re oriented like that.
You&#39;re looking at my head this way.
											Imagine taking the skull off
											and looking at the surface of the brain like that.
											Okay, now as you can see,
											the surface of the brain is all folded up.
											So that&#39;s not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.
											We want to see the whole thing,
											so let&#39;s inflate it so we can see the whole thing.
											Next, let&#39;s find that face area I&#39;ve been talking about
											that responds to images like these.
											To see that, let&#39;s turn the brain around
											and look on the inside surface on the bottom,
											and there it is, that&#39;s my face area.
											Just to the right of that is another region
											that is shown in purple
											that responds when you process color information,
											and near those regions are other regions
											that are involved in perceiving places,
											like right now, I&#39;m seeing
this layout of space around me
											and these regions in green right there
											are really active.
											There&#39;s another one out on the outside surface again
											where there&#39;s a couple more face regions as well.
											Also in this vicinity
											is a region that&#39;s selectively involved
											in processing visual motion,
											like these moving dots here,
											and that&#39;s in yellow at the bottom of the brain,
											and near that is a region that responds
											when you look at images of bodies and body parts
											like these, and that region is shown in lime green
											at the bottom of the brain.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now all these regions I&#39;ve shown you so far
											are involved in specific aspects of visual perception.
											Do we also have specialized brain regions
											for other senses, like hearing?
											Yes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit,
											here&#39;s a region in dark blue
											that we reported just a couple of months ago,
											and this region responds strongly
											when you hear sounds with pitch, like these.
											(Sirens)
											(Cello music)
											(Doorbell)
											In contrast, that same region
does not respond strongly
											when you hear perfectly familiar sounds
											that don&#39;t have a clear pitch, like these.

											(Drum roll)

are selectively responsive

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Okay, now let&#39;s look at these same regions.
											In my left hemisphere, there&#39;s a similar arrangement —
											not identical, but similar —
											and most of the same regions are in here,
											albeit sometimes different in size.

									<p>
											Now, everything I&#39;ve shown you so far
											are regions that are involved in
different aspects of perception,
											vision and hearing.
											Do we also have specialized brain regions
											for really fancy, complicated mental processes?
											Yes, we do.
											So here in pink are my language regions.
											So it&#39;s been known for a very long time
											that that general vicinity of the brain
											is involved in processing language,
											but we showed very recently
											that these pink regions
											respond extremely selectively.
											They respond when you understand
the meaning of a sentence,
											but not when you do other complex mental things,
											like mental arithmetic
											or holding information in memory
											or appreciating the complex structure
											in a piece of music.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The most amazing region that&#39;s been found yet
											is this one right here in turquoise.
											This region responds
											when you think about what another person is thinking.
											So that may seem crazy,
											but actually, we humans do this all the time.
											You&#39;re doing this when you realize
											that your partner is going to be worried
											if you don&#39;t call home to say you&#39;re running late.
											I&#39;m doing this with that region of my brain right now
											when I realize that you guys
											are probably now wondering about
											all that gray, uncharted territory in the brain,
											and what&#39;s up with that?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, I&#39;m wondering about that too,
											and we&#39;re running a bunch of
experiments in my lab right now
											to try to find a number of other
											possible specializations in the brain
											for other very specific mental functions.
											But importantly, I don&#39;t think we have
											specializations in the brain
											for every important mental function,
											even mental functions that may be critical for survival.
											In fact, a few years ago,
											there was a scientist in my lab
											who became quite convinced
											that he&#39;d found a brain region
											for detecting food,
											and it responded really strongly in the scanner
											when people looked at images like this.
											And further, he found a similar response
											in more or less the same location
											in 10 out of 12 subjects.
											So he was pretty stoked,
											and he was running around the lab
											telling everyone that he was going to go on &quot;Oprah&quot;
											with his big discovery.
											But then he devised the critical test:
											He showed subjects images of food like this
											and compared them to images with very similar
											color and shape, but that weren&#39;t food, like these.
											And his region responded the same
											to both sets of images.
											So it wasn&#39;t a food area,
											it was just a region that liked colors and shapes.
											So much for &quot;Oprah.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But then the question, of course, is,
											how do we process all this other stuff
											that we don&#39;t have specialized brain regions for?
											Well, I think the answer is that in addition
											to these highly specialized components
that I&#39;ve been describing,
											we also have a lot of very general-
purpose machinery in our heads
											that enables us to tackle
											whatever problem comes along.
											In fact, we&#39;ve shown recently that
											these regions here in white
											respond whenever you do any difficult mental task
											at all —
											well, of the seven that we&#39;ve tested.
											So each of the brain regions that I&#39;ve described
											to you today
											is present in approximately the same location
											in every normal subject.
											I could take any of you,
											pop you in the scanner,
											and find each of those regions in your brain,
											and it would look a lot like my brain,
											although the regions would be slightly different
											in their exact location and in their size.

									<p>
											What&#39;s important to me about this work
											is not the particular locations of these brain regions,
											but the simple fact that we have
											selective, specific components of mind and brain
											in the first place.
											I mean, it could have been otherwise.
											The brain could have been a single,
											general-purpose processor,
											more like a kitchen knife
											than a Swiss Army knife.
											Instead, what brain imaging has delivered
											is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind.
											So we have this picture of very general-purpose
											machinery in our heads
											in addition to this surprising array
											of very specialized components.

											It&#39;s early days in this enterprise.
											We&#39;ve painted only the first brushstrokes
											in our neural portrait of the human mind.
											The most fundamental questions remain unanswered.
											So for example, what does each
of these regions do exactly?
											Why do we need three face areas
											and three place areas,
											and what&#39;s the division of labor between them?
											Second, how are all these things
											connected in the brain?
											With diffusion imaging,
											you can trace bundles of neurons
											that connect to different parts of the brain,
											and with this method shown here,
											you can trace the connections of
individual neurons in the brain,
											potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram
											of the entire human brain.
											Third, how does all of this
											very systematic structure get built,
											both over development in childhood
											and over the evolution of our species?
											To address questions like that,
											scientists are now scanning
											other species of animals,
											and they&#39;re also scanning human infants.

											Many people justify the high
cost of neuroscience research
											by pointing out that it may help us someday
											to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s and autism.
											That&#39;s a hugely important goal,
											and I&#39;d be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it,
											but fixing things that are broken in the world
											is not the only thing that&#39;s worth doing.
											The effort to understand the human mind and brain
											is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment
											of a single disease.
											What could be more thrilling
											than to understand the fundamental mechanisms
											that underlie human experience,
											to understand, in essence, who we are?
											This is, I think, the greatest scientific quest

MIT researcher Nancy Kanwisher seeks to answer this question by discovering a &ldquo;parts list&rdquo; for the human mind and brain. &quot;Understanding the nature of the human mind,&quot; she <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/media/pdfs/Kanwisher.PNAS2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">says</a>, &quot;is arguably the greatest intellectual quest of all time.&quot;</p>  <p>Kanwisher and her colleagues have used fMRI to identify distinct sites in the brain for face recognition, knowing where you are, and thinking about other people&rsquo;s thoughts. Yet these discoveries are a prelude to bigger questions: How do these brain regions develop and function? What are the actual computations that go on in each region, and how are these computations implemented in circuits of neurons? And how do these work together to produce human intelligence?<br /><br />To learn more, see <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/nancysbraintalks/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Kanwisher&#39;s collection of short talks</a>   on how scientists actually study the human mind and brain and what they have learned so far.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Nancy Kanwisher","tags":["brain","neuroscience","visualizations"],"title":"A neural portrait of the human mind","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1141057}]}
