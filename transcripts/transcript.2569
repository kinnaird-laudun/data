<title>Gautam Bhan: A bold plan to house 100 million people | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata -- all the major cities across India have one great thing in common: they welcome people arriving in search of work. But what lies at the other end of such openness and acceptance? Sadly, a shortage of housing for an estimated 100 million people, many of whom end up living in informal settlements. Gautam Bhan, a human settlement expert and researcher, is boldly reimagining a solution to this problem. He shares a new vision of urban India where everyone has a safe, sturdy home.

<meta content='Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata — all the major cities across India have one great thing in common: they welcome people arriving in search of work. But what lies at the other end of such openness and acceptance? Sadly, a shortage of housing for an estimated 100 million people, many of whom end up living in informal settlements. Gautam Bhan, a human settlement expert and researcher, is boldly reimagining a solution to this problem. He shares a new vision of urban India where everyone has a safe, sturdy home.

											I know you are thinking
											that settlements are made
on illegally captured land,
											but capturing of land never happens
in the dead of the night.
											Whether the land belongs
to the government or not,
											a settlement is never formed secretly.
											It is inhabited over time.
											The government also agrees that
											the settlements in our cities have been
there for over 10, 20, 30, even 40 years.
											What kind of
illegally captured land is this,
											which was ignored for 30 years
											and suddenly a day before eviction
is declared illegal?
											A settlement can easily accommodate
15 to 60 percent of a city&#39;s population
											by using just one, two
or maximum ten percent of the land.
											Can such a huge number of people not have
a right over this small bit of land?

											A city&#39;s progress is often measured
by the cost of its land.
											How do you ascribe a cost to the life
of a person living on a piece of land?
											A settlement is not asking you
for shiny homes;
											all it&#39;s asking for is basic necessities:
											electricity, roads, water,
toilets and drainage.
											We call this <i>upgradation.</i>
											Here&#39;s an example of upgradation.
											In Ahmedabad, they started a program
											where for ten years, 44 settlements were
promised there wouldn&#39;t be any eviction.
											Only a promise.
											Nothing written, no documents.
											And basic necessities
were provided to them.
											In ten years that slum changed into
a locality, a place, a world of its own.
											The government didn&#39;t have to build
even a single new home.

											Thailand launched this program

to live over that land.
											But pay attention here.
											Not the right to sell,

											use it, settle on it.
											The whole world knows now
that to move forward,
											we cannot remove settlements.

											To apply this new thinking to settlements,
											we, that is you and me,
need to look deep within
											and get rid of the disgust, disrespect
and apprehensions that we have.
											Actually I should not be standing
here in front of you today.
											A person from the settlement who lives
there should be standing here.
											But if someone like that came here,
you wouldn&#39;t have listened to him.
											You are listening to me, because you think
I am not from a settlement.

For too long, he says, &quot;Southern cities have been places for others to come and fix, rather than places with their own ways of getting things done that work for us.&quot;</p><p>Bhan believes that urbanization in the global south is one of the most profound challenges of the 21st century. It&#39;s in these cities that many of the battles of sustainability and equity will either be won or lost. He found his way to these questions in his own city -- New Delhi -- through forced evictions, the brutal demolition of the homes of the city&#39;s poorest who lived in informal settlements that brought him to his work on housing and the right to the city. His research is informed by his own political engagement both as an anti-eviction activist as well as someone working with the government to prevent evictions from occurring in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhan teaches as the Indian Institute for Human Settlements in Bangalore, a new educational institution that shares his intent of bringing together teaching, research and practice on the city as well as producing knowledge from the south.

For too long, he says, &quot;Southern cities have been places for others to come and fix, rather than places with their own ways of getting things done that work for us.&quot;</p><p>Bhan believes that urbanization in the global south is one of the most profound challenges of the 21st century. It&#39;s in these cities that many of the battles of sustainability and equity will either be won or lost. He found his way to these questions in his own city -- New Delhi -- through forced evictions, the brutal demolition of the homes of the city&#39;s poorest who lived in informal settlements that brought him to his work on housing and the right to the city. His research is informed by his own political engagement both as an anti-eviction activist as well as someone working with the government to prevent evictions from occurring in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhan teaches as the Indian Institute for Human Settlements in Bangalore, a new educational institution that shares his intent of bringing together teaching, research and practice on the city as well as producing knowledge from the south. In 2017, he authored&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/Ikvmb\" target=\"_blank\"><em>In the Public&rsquo;s Interest: Evictions, Citizenship and Inequality in Contemporary Delhi</em></a>&nbsp;(Orient Blackswan/University of Georgia Press), as well as co-edited the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/1y0FW\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Routledge Companion to Planning in the Global South</em></a>&nbsp;(Routledge). He writes as much publicly as academically and is a frequent columnist in Indian newspapers, blogs and online. He is also the co-founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://newtext.in/\" target=\"_blank\">New Text</a>, and he&#39;s deeply involved in sexuality rights movements in India.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Gautam Bhan","tags":["india","infrastructure","engineering","cities","poverty","social change"],"title":"A bold plan to house 100 million people","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":358745}]}
