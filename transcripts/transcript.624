											You know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slavery
											started with a leaflet that I picked up in London.
											It was the early &#39;90s,
											and I was at a public event.
											I saw this leaflet and it said,
											&quot;There are millions of slaves in the world today.&quot;
											And I thought, &quot;No way, no way.&quot;
											And I&#39;m going to admit to hubris.
											Because I also, I&#39;m going to admit to you,
											I also thought, &quot;How can I be like
											a hot-shot young full professor
											who teaches human rights and not know this?
											So it can&#39;t be true.&quot;
									</p>

											Well, if you teach, if you worship
											in the temple of learning,
											do not mock the gods,
											because they will take you,
											fill you with curiosity and desire,
											and drive you. Drive you with a passion
											to change things.
											I went out and did a lit review,
											3,000 articles on the key word &quot;slavery.&quot;
											Two turned out to be about contemporary — only two.
											All the rest were historical.
											They were press pieces and they were full of outrage,
											they were full of speculation, they were anecdotal —
											no solid information.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, I began to do a research project of my own.
											I went to five countries around the world.
											I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders,
											and I looked very deeply
											into slave-based businesses
											because this is an economic crime.
											People do not enslave people to be mean to them.
											They do it to make a profit.
											And I&#39;ve got to tell you, what I found out in the world
											in four different continents,
											was depressingly familiar.
											Like this:
											Agricultural workers in Africa,
											whipped and beaten,
											showing us how they were beaten in the fields
											before they escaped from slavery
											and met up with our film crew.
											It was mind-blowing.

											And I want to be very clear.
											I&#39;m talking about real slavery.
											This is not about lousy marriages,
											this is not about jobs that suck.
											This is about people who can not walk away,
											people who are forced to work without pay,
											people who are operating 24/7
											under a threat of violence
											and have no pay.
											It&#39;s real slavery in exactly the same way
											that slavery would be recognized
											throughout all of human history.

									<p>
											Now, where is it?
											Well, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors
											are the places with the highest densities of slavery.
											But in fact that kind of bluey color
											are the countries where we can&#39;t find any cases of slavery.
											And you might notice that it&#39;s only Iceland and Greenland
											where we can&#39;t find any cases of enslavement
											around the world.

									<p>
											We&#39;re also particularly interested
											and looking very carefully
											at places where
											slaves are being used to perpetrate
											extreme environmental destruction.
											Around the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment,
											cutting down trees in the Amazon; destroying
											forest areas in West Africa;
											mining and spreading mercury around
											in places like Ghana and the Congo;
											destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia.
											It&#39;s a pretty harrowing linkage
											between what&#39;s happening to our environment
											and what&#39;s happening to our human rights.

									<p>
											Now, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this,
											where we have 27 million people
											in slavery in the year 2010?
											That&#39;s double the number that came out of Africa
											in the entire transatlantic slave trade.
											Well, it builds up with these factors.
											They are not causal, they are actually supporting factors.
											One we all know about, the population explosion:
											the world goes from two billion people to almost
											seven billion people in the last 50 years.
											Being numerous does not make you a slave.
											Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people
											in the developing world,
											caused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts,
											kleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We understand how that works. In some countries
											all of those things happen at once,
											like Sierra Leone a few years ago,
											and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact,
											as we know, live on the edge,
											live in situations where
											they don&#39;t have any opportunity and are usually even destitute.
											But that doesn&#39;t make you a slave either.
											What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable
											into a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.
											If the rule of law is sound, it protects
											the poor and it protects the vulnerable.
											But if corruption creeps in
											and people don&#39;t have the opportunity
											to have that protection of the rule of law,
											then if you can use violence,
											if you can use violence with impunity,
											you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable
											into slavery.

											there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery
											to work for themselves,
											are they motivated?
											They take their kids out of the workplace,
											they build a school, they say,
											&quot;We&#39;re going to have stuff we&#39;ve never had before like three squares,
