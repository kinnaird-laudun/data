<title>Mary Bassett: Why your doctor should care about social justice | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In Zimbabwe in the 1980s, Mary Bassett witnessed the AIDS epidemic firsthand, and she helped set up a clinic to treat and educate local people about the deadly virus. But looking back, she regrets not sounding the alarm for the real problem: the structural inequities embedded in the world&#39;s political and economic organizations, inequities that make marginalized people more vulnerable. These same structural problems exist in the United States today, and as New York City&#39;s Health Commissioner, Bassett is using every chance she has to rally support for health equity and speak out against racism. &quot;We don&#39;t have to have all the answers to call for change,&quot; she says. &quot;We just need courage.&quot;" />

<meta content='In Zimbabwe in the 1980s, Mary Bassett witnessed the AIDS epidemic firsthand, and she helped set up a clinic to treat and educate local people about the deadly virus. But looking back, she regrets not sounding the alarm for the real problem: the structural inequities embedded in the world&#x0027;s political and economic organizations, inequities that make marginalized people more vulnerable. These same structural problems exist in the United States today, and as New York City&#x0027;s Health Commissioner, Bassett is using every chance she has to rally support for health equity and speak out against racism. "We don&#x0027;t have to have all the answers to call for change," she says. "We just need courage."' itemprop='description'>

											When I moved to Harare in 1985,
											social justice was at the core
of Zimbabwe&#39;s national health policy.
											The new government emerged
from a long war of independence
											and immediately proclaimed
a socialist agenda:
											health care services, primary education
											became essentially free.
											A massive expansion
of rural health centers
											placed roughly 80 percent
of the population
											less than a two-hour walk
from these facilities,
											a truly remarkable accomplishment.
											In 1980, the year of independence,
											25 percent of Zimbabwean children
were fully immunized.
											By 1990, a mere decade later,
											this proportion stood at 80 percent.

											I felt tremendously privileged
to be part of this transformation,
											a revolution.
											The excitement,
the camaraderie, was palpable.
											Working side by side
with brilliant Zimbabweans —
											scientists, doctors, activists —
											I felt connected not only
to an African independence movement,
											but to a global progressive
public health movement.

											But there were daunting challenges.
											Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case
in 1985, the year I arrived.
											I had taken care of a few patients
with AIDS in the early 1980s,
											when I did my medical training
at Harlem Hospital, but —
											we had no idea
what lay in store for Africa.
											Infection rate stood at about
two percent in my early days there.
											These would soar
											to one out of every four adults
											by the time I left Harare 17 years later.
											By the mid-1990s,
											I&#39;d told hundreds of people
in the prime of life
											that they were HIV-positive.
											I saw colleagues and friends die,
											my students, hospital patients, die.

											In response, my colleagues and I
set up a clinic.
											We did condom demonstrations.
											We launched school education
and workplace interventions.
											We did research. We counseled
the partners of infected men
											about how to protect themselves.
											We worked hard, and at the time,
I believed that I was doing my best.
											I was providing excellent treatment,
											such as it was.
											But I was not talking
about structural change.

											Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan
has spoken candidly

											In 1994, he was head
of the UN peacekeeping department.
											At a 10-year memorial for the genocide,

I was doing my best,

											that there was more
I could and should have done

the health community unprepared,

											But while living in Zimbabwe,
											I didn&#39;t see my role
as an advocacy or a political one.
											I was there for my technical skills,
											both my clinical and my research
epidemiology skills.
											And in my mind, my job
was to take care of patients
											and to do research to better understand
the population patterns of transmission,
											and I hoped that we&#39;d slow
the spread of the virus.
											I was aware that socially marginalized

											But I knew
											that epidemics emerge
along the fissures of our society,
											reflecting not only biology,
											but more importantly
patterns of marginalization, exclusion,
											discrimination related to race,
gender, sexuality, class and more.
											It was true of AIDS.
											It was true just recently of Ebola.
											Medical anthropologists
such as Paul Farmer,
											who worked on AIDS in Haiti,
											call this structural violence:
											structural because inequities are embedded
											in the political and economic
organization of our social world,
											often in ways that are invisible
to those with privilege and power;
											and violence because its impact —
											premature deaths,
suffering, illness — is violent.
											We do little for our patients

											Sounding the alarm is the first step
towards doing public health right,

											So these days, I&#39;m not staying quiet.
											I&#39;m speaking up about a lot of things,
											even when it makes listeners
uncomfortable,
											even when it makes me uncomfortable.
											And a lot of this
is about racial disparities
											and institutionalized racism,
											things that we&#39;re not supposed
to have in this country anymore,
											certainly not in the practice of medicine
											or public health.
											But we have them,
											and we pay for them in lives cut short.
											That&#39;s why sounding the alarm
											about the impact of racism on health
in the United States,
											the ongoing institutional
and interpersonal violence
											that people of color face,
											compounded by our tragic legacy
											of 250 years of slavery,
											90 years of Jim Crow
											and 60 years of imperfect equality,
											sounding the alarm about this
											is central to doing my job right
											as New York City&#39;s Health Commissioner.
											In New York City, premature mortality —
that&#39;s death before the age of 65 —
											is 50 percent higher
for black men than white ones.
											A black woman in 2012
											faced more than 10 times
the risk of dying related to childbirth
											as a white woman.
											And though we&#39;ve made enormous strides
											in reducing infant mortality rates,
											a black baby still faces
											nearly three times the risk
of death in its first year of life
											as compared to a white baby.

											New York City&#39;s not exceptional.
											These statistics are paralleled
											by statistics found
across the United States.
											A recent New York Times analysis
											reported that there are 1.5 million
missing black men across the country.
											They noted that more than one
											out of every six black men
											who today should be
between the ages of 25 and 54 years
											have disappeared from daily life,
											lost either to prison or premature death.
											There is great injustice
											in the daily and disproportionate violence
faced by young black men,
											the focus of recent protests
under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.
											But we have to remember
											that enduring and disparate rates
											and the occurrence and outcome
of common medical conditions —
											heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV —
											diseases that may kill slowly and quietly
											and take even more
black lives prematurely.

											As the #BlackLivesMatter
movement unfolded,
											I felt frustrated and angry
											that the medical community
											has been reluctant
to even use the word &quot;racism&quot;
											in our research and our work.
											You&#39;ve probably felt something
every time I&#39;ve said it.
											Our medical students
held die-ins in their white coats,
											but the medical community
has largely stood by passively
											as ongoing discrimination
continues to affect
											the disease profile and mortality.
											And I worry
											that the trend towards personalized
and precision medicine,
											looking for biological or genetic targets
to better tailor treatment,
											may inadvertently cause us
to lose sight of the big picture,
											that it is the daily context,
											where a person lives, grows,
											works, loves,
											that most importantly
determines population health,
											and for too many of us, poor health.
