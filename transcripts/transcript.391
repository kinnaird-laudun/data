											Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery
											because of their tall stature, their complex structure,
											the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.
											I used to climb trees for fun all the time
											and now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees
											and forests, through the medium of science.

											The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.
											And Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983,
											called the canopy, &quot;the last biotic frontier.&quot;
											I&#39;d like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy,
											and share with you what canopy researchers are asking
											and also how they&#39;re communicating with other people outside of science.

											Let&#39;s start our journey on the forest floor
											of one of my study sites in Costa Rica.
											Because of the overhanging leaves and branches,
											you&#39;ll notice that the understory is very dark,
											it&#39;s very still.
											And what I&#39;d like to do is take you up to the canopy,
											not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses,
											but rather showing you a very short clip
											from a National Geographic film called &quot;Heroes of the High Frontier.&quot;
											This was filmed in Monteverde, Costa Rica
											and I think it gives us the best impression of what it&#39;s like
											to climb a giant strangler fig.

											So what you&#39;ll see up there is that it&#39;s really like the atmosphere of an open field,
											and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted
											to make their way and their life in the canopy.
											Common groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptations
											for forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws.
											But I&#39;d like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity
											and tell you about the ants.
											There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists —
											people who describe and name animals — have named.
											4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy.

									<p>
											One of the reasons I tell you about ants
											is because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomist
											and when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did —
											Procryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.
											We&#39;ve had two children, August Andrew and Erika
											and actually, he named ants after them.
											So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us.

											But my passion — in addition to Jack and my children —
											are the plants, the so-called epiphytes,
											those plants that grow up on trees.
											They don&#39;t have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor.
											But rather, it is their leaves that are adapted
											to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog.
											These plants occur in great diversity,
											over 28,000 species around the world.
											They grow in tropical forests like this one
											and they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses.
											One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes,
											as they die and decompose, they actually construct an arboreal soil,
											both in the temperate zone and in the tropics.
											And these mosses, generated by decomposing,
											are like peat moss in your garden.
											They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											One of the surprising things I discovered
											is that, if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes,
											what you&#39;ll find underneath them are connections, networks
											of what we call canopy roots.
											These are not epiphyte roots:
											these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves.
											And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent
											in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I was interested, and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested
											in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest.
											We&#39;ve done stripping experiments
											where we&#39;ve removed mats of epiphytes
											and looked at the rates of recolonization.
											We had predicted that they would grow back very quickly
											and that they would come in encroaching from the side.
											What we found, however, was that they took an extremely long time —
											over 20 years — to regenerate,
											starting from the bottom and growing up.
											And even now, after 25 years,
											they&#39;re not up there, they have not recolonized completely.
											And I use this little image to say
											this is what happens to mosses.
											If it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone,
											and if you&#39;re really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom.

											So, recolonization is really very slow.
											These canopy communities are fragile.
											Well, when we look out, you and I, over that canopy
											of the intact primary forest,
											what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon.
											One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today
											is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.
											We know it&#39;s a lot,
											but we do not yet know the answers to how much,
											and by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere,
											held in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem.

											are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy

											Here in 2009, you know, it&#39;s not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist,

											I know that as a scientist, I have information
											and as a human being, I can communicate with anybody,
											inside or outside of academia.
											And so, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve begin doing,
											and so I&#39;d like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.
											We consult to the media about canopy questions;
											we have a canopy newsletter;
											we have an email LISTSERV.
											And so we&#39;re trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy,
											the beauty of the canopy,
											the necessity of intact canopies,
											to people outside of academia.
											We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make —
											those videos and so forth —
											you know, they don&#39;t reach everybody,

											and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to.

											This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao
											who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department
											at Rhode Island School of Design.
											He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences
											in the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.
											We&#39;ve had dance people up in the canopy.
											Jodi Lomask, and her wonderful troupe Capacitor,
											joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.
											They made a fabulous dance called &quot;Biome.&quot;

											and we are taking this dance, my scientific outreach communications,
											and also linking up with environmental groups,
											to go to different cities and to perform
											the science, the dance and the environmental outreach
											that we hope will make a difference.
											We brought musicians to the canopy,
											and they made their music — and it&#39;s fantastic music.
											We had wooden flutists, we had oboists,
											we had opera singers, we had guitar players,
											and we had rap singers.

											This experience of working with Duke
											also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.
											I saw the power of Duke&#39;s song with urban youth —
											an audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor,
											I don&#39;t have a hope of getting to —
											in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.
											So I engaged Caution, this rap singer,
											with a group of young people from inner-city Tacoma.
											We went out to the forest, I would pick up a branch,
											Caution would rap on it,
											and suddenly that branch was really cool.
											And then the students would come into our sound studios,
											they would make their own rap songs with their own beats.
											They ended up making a CD
											which they took home to their family and friends,
											thereby expressing their own experiences with nature
											in their own medium.

											The final project I&#39;ll talk about is one that&#39;s very close to my heart,
											and it involves an economic and social value
											that is associated with epiphytic plants.
											In the Pacific Northwest,
											there&#39;s a whole industry of moss-harvesting
											from old-growth forests.
											These mosses are taken from the forest;
											they&#39;re used by the floriculture industry, by florists,
											to make arrangements and make hanging baskets.
											It&#39;s a 265 million dollar industry
											and it&#39;s increasing rapidly.
											If you remember that bald guy,
											you&#39;ll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks
											in the Pacific Northwest old-growth forest
											is going to take decades and decades to come back.
											So this whole industry is unsustainable.
											What can I, as an ecologist, do about that?

									<p>
											Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses,
											and that way we wouldn&#39;t have to take them out of the wild.
											And I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this,
											that would be great.
											And so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women —
											who don&#39;t have access to nature,
											who often have a lot of time, they often have space,
											and you don&#39;t need any sharp tools to work with mosses —
											would be great partners.
											And they have become excellent partners.
											The best I can imagine.
											They were very enthusiastic.

											They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.
											They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses,
											which, to tell you the truth,
											is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do.
											And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design
											in order to grow these mosses.
											We&#39;ve been successful as partners
											in figuring out which species grow the fastest,
											and I&#39;ve just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been.
											Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well,
											I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons.
											I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison.
											We gave talks once a month,
											and that actually ended up implementing
											some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons —
											organic gardens, worm culture, recycling,
											water catchment and beekeeping. (Applause)

											from the Department of Corrections at Washington state,
											they&#39;ve asked us to expand this program to three more prisons.
											And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves
											learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog
											which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.
											So they will raise them — in captivity, of course —
											from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs.
											And they will have the pleasure, many of them,
											of seeing those frogs that they&#39;ve raised from eggs and helped develop,

											And so I&#39;m hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist,
											can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.
											Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together

											So, although it&#39;s a little bit of a fantasy, I think it&#39;s also a reality.
											Given the duress that we&#39;re feeling environmentally in these times,
											it is time for scientists to reach outward,
											and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.
											I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests
											with the tools of science.
											By making these partnerships that I described to you,

											When I look into my heart, I see trees —

											there are trees in our hearts,
											there are trees in your hearts.
											When we come to understand nature,
											we are touching the most deep, the most important parts of our self.
											In these partnerships, I have also learned
											that people tend to compartmentalize themselves
											into IT people, and movie star people, and scientists,
											but when we share nature,
											when we share our perspectives about nature,
											we find a common denominator.

A pioneering researcher in this area, Nadkarni created the <a href=\"http://canopy.evergreen.edu/bcd/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Canopy Database</a>  to help researchers store and understand the rich trove of data she and others are uncovering.</p><p>Nadkarni teaches at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, but her work outside the academy is equally fascinating -- using nontraditional vectors to teach the general public about trees and the ecosystem. For instance, <strong>she recently collaborated with the dance troupe Capacitor to explore the process of growth through the medium of the human body.</strong> In another project, she worked with prison inmates to grow moss for the horticulture trade, to relieve the collecting pressure on wild mosses. The project inspired in her students a new reverence for nature -- and some larger ecochanges at the prison.</p><p>She&#39;s the author of <a href=\"http://www.powells.com/biblio/9780520248564?&amp;PID=30290\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Between Earth and Sky: Our Intimate Connections to Trees</em></a>. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Nalini Nadkarni","tags":["activism","animals","biodiversity","biology","children","environment","insects","trees","plants","ecology"],"title":"Conserving the canopy","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":434739}]}
