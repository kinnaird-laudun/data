											So, why was psychology good?
											Well, for more than 60 years, psychology
worked within the disease model.
											Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane
											and I introduced myself to my seatmate,
and told them what I did,
											they&#39;d move away from me,
											because, quite rightly, they were saying
											psychology is about finding
what&#39;s wrong with you.

											about working in the disease model,
											about what you mean by psychology —
											is that, 60 years ago,
none of the disorders were treatable;
											it was entirely smoke and mirrors.

are treatable,

											And the other thing that happened
is that a science developed,

											We found out we could take fuzzy concepts
											like depression, alcoholism,
											and measure them with rigor;
											that we could create a classification
of the mental illnesses;
											that we could understand
the causality of the mental illnesses.
											We could look across time
at the same people —
											people, for example, who were genetically
vulnerable to schizophrenia —

of mothering, of genetics are,

											The first is that psychology
should be just as concerned

											It should be just as concerned
with building strength

of tests of happiness.
											You can ask, how do you stack
up for positive emotion, for meaning,

manual of the insanities:
											a classification of the strengths
and virtues that looks at the sex ratio,

that&#39;s not nearly enough,

											We found we could begin to look
at interventions over the centuries,

											About 120 interventions have been proposed
that allegedly make people happy.
											And we find that we&#39;ve been able
to manualize many of them,

											random-assignment efficacy
and effectiveness studies.

make people lastingly happier?

											But the upshot of this is that the mission
I want psychology to have,
											in addition to its mission
of curing the mentally ill,
											and in addition to its mission of making
miserable people less miserable,
											is, can psychology actually
make people happier?
											And to ask that question — &quot;happy&quot;
is not a word I use very much —
											we&#39;ve had to break it down
											into what I think
is askable about &quot;happy.&quot;
											And I believe there are three different —
											I call them &quot;different&quot; because different
interventions build them,
											it&#39;s possible to have one
rather than the other —
											three different happy lives.
											The first happy life is the pleasant life.
											This is a life in which you have
as much positive emotion
											as you possibly can,
											and the skills to amplify it.
											The second is a life of engagement:
											a life in your work, your parenting,
your love, your leisure;
											time stops for you.
											That&#39;s what Aristotle was talking about.
											And third, the meaningful life.
											I want to say a little bit
about each of those lives
											and what we know about them.

											The first life is the pleasant life,
and it&#39;s simply, as best we can find it,
											it&#39;s having as many
of the pleasures as you can,
											as much positive emotion as you can,
											and learning the skills — savoring,
mindfulness — that amplify them,
											that stretch them over time and space.
											But the pleasant life has three drawbacks,
											and it&#39;s why positive psychology
is not happy-ology,

											The first drawback is,
it turns out the pleasant life,
											your experience of positive emotion,
											is about 50 percent heritable,
											and, in fact, not very modifiable.
											So the different tricks
that Matthieu and I and others know
											about increasing the amount
of positive emotion in your life
											are 15 to 20 percent tricks,
getting more of it.
											Second is that positive
emotion habituates.
											It habituates rapidly, indeed.
											It&#39;s all like French vanilla ice cream:
											the first taste is 100 percent;
											by the time you&#39;re down
to the sixth taste,
											it&#39;s gone.

it&#39;s not particularly malleable.

											In two of the three great arenas
of life, by the time Len was 30,
											Len was enormously successful.
											The first arena was work.
											By the time he was 20,
he was an options trader.
											By the time he was 25,

											and the head of an options
trading company.
											Second, in play, he&#39;s a national

											And Len was wealthy enough to be able
to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,
											who for five years tried
to find the sexual trauma
											that had somehow locked
positive emotion inside of him.
											But it turned out there wasn&#39;t
any sexual trauma.

											And our results surprised us;
they were backward of what we thought.
											It turns out the pursuit of pleasure
has almost no contribution
											to life satisfaction.
											The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.
											The pursuit of engagement
is also very strong.
											Where pleasure matters
is if you have both engagement
											and you have meaning,
											then pleasure&#39;s the whipped
cream and the cherry.
											Which is to say, the full life —
the sum is greater than the parts,
											if you&#39;ve got all three.
											Conversely, if you have none
of the three, the empty life,
											the sum is less than the parts.

											And what we&#39;re asking now is:
Does the very same relationship —
											physical health, morbidity,
how long you live and productivity —
											follow the same relationship?
											That is, in a corporation,
											is productivity a function of positive
emotion, engagement and meaning?
											Is health a function
of positive engagement,
											of pleasure, and of meaning in life?
											And there is reason to think the answer
to both of those may well be yes.

											So, Chris said that the last
speaker had a chance
											to try to integrate what he heard,
											and so this was amazing for me.
											I&#39;ve never been in a gathering like this.
											I&#39;ve never seen speakers stretch
beyond themselves so much,
											which was one of the remarkable things.
											But I found that the problems
of psychology seemed to be parallel
											to the problems of technology,
entertainment and design
											in the following way:
											we all know that technology,
entertainment and design
											have been and can be used
for destructive purposes.
											We also know that technology,
entertainment and design
											can be used to relieve misery.
											And by the way, the distinction
between relieving misery
											and building happiness
is extremely important.
											I thought, when I first became
a therapist 30 years ago,
											that if I was good enough
to make someone not depressed,
											not anxious, not angry,
											that I&#39;d make them happy.
											And I never found that;
											I found the best you could ever do
											was to get to zero;
											that they were empty.

									<p>
											And it turns out the skills of happiness,
the skills of the pleasant life,
											the skills of engagement,
the skills of meaning,
											are different from the skills
of relieving misery.
											And so, the parallel thing holds
with technology, entertainment
											and design, I believe.
											That is, it is possible
for these three drivers of our world
											to increase happiness,
											to increase positive emotion.
											And that&#39;s typically
how they&#39;ve been used.
											But once you fractionate
happiness the way I do —
											not just positive emotion,
that&#39;s not nearly enough —
											there&#39;s flow in life,
and there&#39;s meaning in life.
											As Laura Lee told us,
											design and, I believe,
entertainment and technology,
											can be used to increase meaning
engagement in life as well.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So in conclusion,
											the eleventh reason for optimism,
											in addition to the space elevator,
											is that I think with technology,
entertainment and design,
											we can actually increase
the amount of tonnage
											of human happiness on the planet.
											And if technology can,
in the next decade or two,
											increase the pleasant life,
the good life and the meaningful life,
											it will be good enough.
											If entertainment can be diverted
to also increase positive emotion,
											meaning eudaemonia,
											it will be good enough.
											And if design can increase
positive emotion,
											eudaemonia, and flow and meaning,
											what we&#39;re all doing together
will become good enough.

It&#39;s a fascinating field of study that had few empirical, scientific measures -- traditional clinical psychology focusing more on the repair of unhappy states than the propagation and nurturing of happy ones.

It&#39;s a fascinating field of study that had few empirical, scientific measures -- traditional clinical psychology focusing more on the repair of unhappy states than the propagation and nurturing of happy ones. In his pioneering work, Seligman directs the <a href=\"http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Positive Psychology Center</a>  at the University of Pennsylvania, developing clinical tools and training the next generation of positive psychologists.</p><p>His earlier work focused on perhaps the opposite state: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness\" target=\"_blank\">learned helplessness</a>, in which a person feels he or she is powerless to change a situation that is, in fact, changeable. Seligman is an often-cited authority in this field as well -- in fact, his is the 13th most likely name to pop up in a general psych textbook. He was the leading consultant on a <em>Consumer Reports</em> study on long-term psychotherapy, and has developed several common pre-employment tests, including the <a href=\"http://www.foresightonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seligman Attributional Style Questionnaire (SASQ)</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Martin Seligman","tags":["brain","education","happiness","psychology","science","technology","personality","introvert","evolutionary psychology","emotions"],"title":"The new era of positive psychology","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":4546264}]}
