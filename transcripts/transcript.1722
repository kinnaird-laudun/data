<title>Simon Anholt: Which country does the most good for the world? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: It&#39;s an unexpected side effect of globalization: problems that once would have stayed local—say, a bank lending out too much money—now have consequences worldwide. But still, countries operate independently, as if alone on the planet. Policy advisor Simon Anholt has dreamed up an unusual scale to get governments thinking outwardly: The Good Country Index. In a riveting and funny talk, he answers the question, &quot;Which country does the most good?&quot; The answer may surprise you (especially if you live in the US or China)." />

<meta content='It&#x0027;s an unexpected side effect of globalization: problems that once would have stayed local—say, a bank lending out too much money—now have consequences worldwide. But still, countries operate independently, as if alone on the planet. Policy advisor Simon Anholt has dreamed up an unusual scale to get governments thinking outwardly: The Good Country Index. In a riveting and funny talk, he answers the question, "Which country does the most good?" The answer may surprise you (especially if you live in the US or China).' itemprop='description'>

											I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the world recently
											and how it&#39;s changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.
											Twenty or 30 years ago,
											if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died
											in a remote village in East Asia,
											it would have been a tragedy for the chicken
											and its closest relatives,
											but I don&#39;t think there was much possibility
											of us fearing a global pandemic
											and the deaths of millions.
											Twenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America
											lent too much money to some people
											who couldn&#39;t afford to pay it back
											and the bank went bust,
											that was bad for the lender
											and bad for the borrower,
											but we didn&#39;t imagine it would bring
											the global economic system to its knees
											for nearly a decade.

											This is globalization.
											This is the miracle that has enabled us
											to transship our bodies and our minds
											and our words and our pictures and our ideas
											and our teaching and our learning around the planet
											ever faster and ever cheaper.
											It&#39;s brought a lot of bad stuff,
											like the stuff that I just described,
											but it&#39;s also brought a lot of good stuff.
											A lot of us are not aware
											of the extraordinary successes of
the Millennium Development Goals,
											several of which have achieved their targets
											long before the due date.
											That proves that this species of humanity
											is capable of achieving extraordinary progress
											if it really acts together and it really tries hard.
											But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days,
											I sort of feel that globalization
											has taken us by surprise,
											and we&#39;ve been slow to respond to it.
											If you look at the downside of globalization,
											it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming.
											All of the grand challenges that we face today,
											like climate change and human rights
											and demographics and terrorism and pandemics
											and narco-trafficking and human slavery
											and species loss, I could go on,
											we&#39;re not making an awful lot of progress
											against an awful lot of those challenges.

									<p>
											So in a nutshell, that&#39;s the challenge
											that we all face today
											at this interesting point in history.
											That&#39;s clearly what we&#39;ve got to do next.
											We&#39;ve somehow got to get our act together
											and we&#39;ve got to figure out how to globalize
											the solutions better
											so that we don&#39;t simply become a species
											which is the victim of the globalization of problems.

									<p>
											Why are we so slow at achieving these advances?
											What&#39;s the reason for it?
											Well, there are, of course, a number of reasons,
											but perhaps the primary reason
											is because we&#39;re still organized as a species
											in the same way that we were organized
											200 or 300 years ago.
											There&#39;s one superpower left on the planet
											and that is the seven billion people,
											the seven billion of us who cause all these problems,
											the same seven billion, by the way,
											who will resolve them all.
											But how are those seven billion organized?
											They&#39;re still organized in 200 or so nation-states,
											and the nations have governments
											that make rules
											and cause us to behave in certain ways.
											And that&#39;s a pretty efficient system,
											but the problem is that the
way that those laws are made
											and the way those governments think
											is absolutely wrong for the
solution of global problems,
											because it all looks inwards.
											The politicians that we elect
											and the politicians we don&#39;t elect, on the whole,
											have minds that microscope.
											They don&#39;t have minds that telescope.
											They look in. They pretend, they behave,
											as if they believed that every country was an island
											that existed quite happily, independently
											of all the others
											on its own little planet
											in its own little solar system.
											This is the problem:
											countries competing against each other,
											countries fighting against each other.
											This week, as any week you care to look at,
											you&#39;ll find people actually trying to kill
each other from country to country,
											but even when that&#39;s not going on,
											there&#39;s competition between countries,
											each one trying to shaft the next.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This is clearly not a good arrangement.
											We clearly need to change it.
											We clearly need to find ways
											of encouraging countries to start working together
											a little bit better.
											And why won&#39;t they do that?
											Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, the first and most obvious reason
											is because that&#39;s what we ask them to do.
											That&#39;s what we tell them to do.
											When we elect governments
											or when we tolerate unelected governments,
											we&#39;re effectively telling them that what we want
											is for them to deliver us in our country
											a certain number of things.
											We want them to deliver prosperity,
											growth, competitiveness, transparency, justice
											and all of those things.
											So unless we start asking our governments
											to think outside a little bit,
											to consider the global problems that will finish us all
											if we don&#39;t start considering them,
											then we can hardly blame them
											if what they carry on doing is looking inwards,
											if they still have minds that microscope
											rather than minds that telescope.
											That&#39;s the first reason why
things tend not to change.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The second reason is that these governments,
											just like all the rest of us,
											are cultural psychopaths.
											I don&#39;t mean to be rude,
											but you know what a psychopath is.
											A psychopath is a person who,
											unfortunately for him or her,
											lacks the ability to really empathize
											with other human beings.
											When they look around,
											they don&#39;t see other human beings
											with deep, rich, three-dimensional personal lives
											and aims and ambitions.
											What they see is cardboard cutouts,
											and it&#39;s very sad and it&#39;s very lonely,
											and it&#39;s very rare, fortunately.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But actually, aren&#39;t most of us
											not really so very good at empathy?
											Oh sure, we&#39;re very good at empathy
											when it&#39;s a question of dealing with people
											who kind of look like us
											and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray
											and wear like us,
											but when it comes to people who don&#39;t do that,
											who don&#39;t quite dress like us
											and don&#39;t quite pray like us
											and don&#39;t quite talk like us,
											do we not also have a tendency to see them
											ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too?
											And this is a question we need to ask ourselves.
											I think constantly we have to monitor it.
											Are we and our politicians to a degree
											cultural psychopaths?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The third reason is hardly worth mentioning
											because it&#39;s so silly,
											but there&#39;s a belief amongst governments
											that the domestic agenda
											and the international agenda
											are incompatible and always will be.
											This is just nonsense.
											In my day job, I&#39;m a policy adviser.
											I&#39;ve spent the last 15 years or so
											advising governments around the world,
											and in all of that time I have never once seen
											a single domestic policy issue
											that could not be more imaginatively,
											effectively and rapidly resolved
											than by treating it as an international problem,
											looking at the international context,
											comparing what others have done,
											bringing in others, working externally
											instead of working internally.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so you may say, well, given all of that,
											why then doesn&#39;t it work?
											Why can we not make our politicians change?
											Why can&#39;t we demand them?
											Well I, like a lot of us, spend
a lot of time complaining
											about how hard it is to make people change,
											and I don&#39;t think we should fuss about it.
											I think we should just accept
											that we are an inherently conservative species.
											We don&#39;t like to change.
											It exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons.
											We probably wouldn&#39;t still be here today
											if we weren&#39;t so resistant to change.
											It&#39;s very simple: Many thousands of years ago,
											we discovered that if we carried on
											doing the same things, we wouldn&#39;t die,
											because the things that we&#39;ve done before
											by definition didn&#39;t kill us,
											and therefore as long as we carry on doing them,
											we&#39;ll be okay,
											and it&#39;s very sensible not to do anything new,
											because it might kill you.
											But of course, there are exceptions to that.
											Otherwise, we&#39;d never get anywhere.
											And one of the exceptions, the interesting exception,
											is when you can show to people
											that there might be some self-interest
											in them making that leap of faith
											and changing a little bit.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I&#39;ve spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years
											trying to find out what could be that self-interest
											that would encourage not just politicians
											but also businesses and general populations,
											all of us, to start to think a little more outwardly,
											to think in a bigger picture,
											not always to look inwards,
sometimes to look outwards.
											And this is where I discovered
											something quite important.
											In 2005, I launched a study
											called the Nation Brands Index.
											What it is, it&#39;s a very large-scale study that polls
											a very large sample of the world&#39;s population,
											a sample that represents about 70 percent
											of the planet&#39;s population,
											and I started asking them a series of questions
											about how they perceive other countries.
											And the Nation Brands Index over the years
											has grown to be a very, very large database.
											It&#39;s about 200 billion data points
											tracking what ordinary people
think about other countries
											and why.
											Why did I do this? Well, because
the governments that I advise
											are very, very keen on knowing
											how they are regarded.
											They&#39;ve known, partly because
											I&#39;ve encouraged them to realize it,
											that countries depend
											enormously on their reputations
											in order to survive and prosper in the world.
											If a country has a great, positive image,
											like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland,
											everything is easy and everything is cheap.
											You get more tourists. You get more investors.
											You sell your products more expensively.
											If, on the other hand, you have a country
											with a very weak or a very negative image,
											everything is difficult and everything is expensive.
											So governments care desperately
											about the image of their country,
											because it makes a direct difference
											to how much money they can make,
											and that&#39;s what they&#39;ve promised their populations
											they&#39;re going to deliver.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So a couple of years ago, I thought I would take
											some time out and speak to that gigantic database
											and ask it,
											why do some people prefer one country
											more than another?
											And the answer that the database gave me
											completely staggered me.
											It was 6.8.
											I haven&#39;t got time to explain in detail.
											Basically what it told me was —
											(Laughter) (Applause) —
											the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries.
											We don&#39;t admire countries
primarily because they&#39;re rich,
											because they&#39;re powerful,
because they&#39;re successful,
											because they&#39;re modern, because
they&#39;re technologically advanced.
											We primarily admire countries that are good.
											What do we mean by good?
											We mean countries that seem to contribute
											something to the world in which we live,
											countries that actually make the world safer
											or better or richer or fairer.
											Those are the countries we like.
											This is a discovery of significant importance —
											you see where I&#39;m going —
											because it squares the circle.
											I can now say, and often do, to any government,
											in order to do well, you need to do good.
											If you want to sell more products,
											if you want to get more investment,
											if you want to become more competitive,
											then you need to start behaving,
											because that&#39;s why people will respect you
											and do business with you,
											and therefore, the more you collaborate,
											the more competitive you become.

									<p>
											This is quite an important discovery,
											and as soon as I discovered this,
											I felt another index coming on.
											I swear that as I get older, my ideas become simpler
											and more and more childish.
											This one is called the Good Country Index,
											and it does exactly what it says on the tin.
											It measures, or at least it tries to measure,
											exactly how much each country on Earth contributes
											not to its own population but to the rest of humanity.
											Bizarrely, nobody had ever thought
											of measuring this before.
											So my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent
											the best part of the last two years,
											with the help of a large number
of very serious and clever people,
											cramming together all the reliable data in the world
											we could find about what countries give
											to the world.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And you&#39;re waiting for me to
tell you which one comes top.
											And I&#39;m going to tell you,
											but first of all I want to tell you
											precisely what I mean
											when I say a good country.
											I do not mean morally good.
											When I say that Country X
											is the goodest country on Earth,
											and I mean goodest, I don&#39;t mean best.
											Best is something different.
											When you&#39;re talking about a good country,
											you can be good, gooder and goodest.
											It&#39;s not the same thing as good, better and best.
											This is a country which simply gives more
											to humanity than any other country.
											I don&#39;t talk about how they behave at home
											because that&#39;s measured elsewhere.
											And the winner is
											Ireland.
											(Applause)
											According to the data here,
											no country on Earth, per head of population,
											per dollar of GDP, contributes more
											to the world that we live in than Ireland.
											What does this mean?
											This means that as we go to sleep at night,
											all of us in the last 15 seconds
before we drift off to sleep,
											our final thought should be,
											godammit, I&#39;m glad that Ireland exists.
											(Laughter)
											And that — (Applause) —
											In the depths of a very severe economic recession,
											I think that there&#39;s a really important lesson there,
											that if you can remember
your international obligations
											whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy,
											that&#39;s really something.
											Finland ranks pretty much the same.
											The only reason why it&#39;s below Ireland
											is because its lowest score is
lower than Ireland&#39;s lowest score.

									<p>
											Now the other thing you&#39;ll
notice about the top 10 there
											is, of course, they&#39;re all, apart from New Zealand,
											Western European nations.
											They&#39;re also all rich.
											This depressed me,
											because one of the things that I did not want
											to discover with this index
											is that it&#39;s purely the province of rich countries
											to help poor countries.
											This is not what it&#39;s all about.
											And indeed, if you look further down the list,
											I don&#39;t have the slide here, you will see
											something that made me very happy indeed,
											that Kenya is in the top 30,
											and that demonstrates one
very, very important thing.
											This is not about money.
											This is about attitude.
											This is about culture.
											This is about a government and a people that care
											about the rest of the world
											and have the imagination and the courage
											to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly.

											I&#39;m going to whip through the other slides
											just so you can see some
of the lower-lying countries.
											There&#39;s Germany at 13th, the U.S. comes 21st,
											Mexico comes 66th,
											and then we have some of
the big developing countries,
											like Russia at 95th, China at 107th.
											Countries like China and Russia and India,
											which is down in the same part of the index,
											well, in some ways, it&#39;s not surprising.
											They&#39;ve spent a great deal of time
											over the last decades building their own economy,
											building their own society and their own polity,
											but it is to be hoped
											that the second phase of their growth
											will be somewhat more outward-looking
											than the first phase has been so far.

											Now that&#39;s the Good Country Index.
											What&#39;s it there for?
											Well, it&#39;s there really because I want to try
											to introduce this word,
											or reintroduce this word, into the discourse.
											I&#39;ve had enough hearing about competitive countries.
											I&#39;ve had enough hearing about
											prosperous, wealthy, fast-growing countries.
											I&#39;ve even had enough hearing about happy countries
											because in the end that&#39;s still selfish.
											That&#39;s still about us,
											and if we carry on thinking about us,
											we are in deep, deep trouble.
											I think we all know what it is
											that we want to hear about.
											We want to hear about good countries,
											and so I want to ask you all a favor.
											I&#39;m not asking a lot.
											It&#39;s something that you might find easy to do
											and you might even find enjoyable
											and even helpful to do,
											and that&#39;s simply to start using the word &quot;good&quot;
											in this context.
											When you think about your own country,
											when you think about other people&#39;s countries,
											when you think about companies,
											when you talk about the world that we live in today,
											start using that word
											in the way that I&#39;ve talked about this evening.
											Not good, the opposite of bad,
											because that&#39;s an argument that never finishes.
											Good, the opposite of selfish,
											good being a country that thinks about all of us.
											That&#39;s what I would like you to do,
											and I&#39;d like you to use it as a stick
											with which to beat your politicians.
											When you elect them, when you reelect them,
											when you vote for them, when you listen
											to what they&#39;re offering you,
											use that word, &quot;good,&quot;
											and ask yourself,
											&quot;Is that what a good country would do?&quot;
											And if the answer is no, be very suspicious.
											Ask yourself, is that the behavior
											of my country?
											Do I want to come from a country
											where the government, in my name,
											is doing things like that?
											Or do I, on the other hand,
											prefer the idea of walking around the world
											with my head held high thinking, &quot;Yeah,
											I&#39;m proud to come from a good country&quot;?
											And everybody will welcome you.
											And everybody in the last 15 seconds
											before they drift off to sleep at night will say,
											&quot;Gosh, I&#39;m glad that person&#39;s country exists.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Ultimately, that, I think,
											is what will make the change.
											That word, &quot;good,&quot;
											and the number 6.8
											and the discovery that&#39;s behind it
											have changed my life.
											I think they can change your life,
											and I think we can use it to change
											the way that our politicians
and our companies behave,
											and in doing so, we can change the world.
											I&#39;ve started thinking very differently about
											my own country since I&#39;ve been
thinking about these things.
											I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country,
											and then I started thinking I
wanted to live in a happy country,
											but I began to realize, it&#39;s not enough.
											I don&#39;t want to live in a rich country.
											I don&#39;t want to live in a fast-growing
											or competitive country.
											I want to live in a good country,
											and I so, so hope that you do too.

founded the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.goodcountry.org\" target=\"_blank\">Good Country</a>, a project aimed at helping countries work together to tackle global challenges like climate change, poverty,
