											So a few weeks ago, a friend
											of mine gave this toy car to his
											8-year-old son.
											But instead of going into a store and buying one,
											like we do normally, he went to this
											website and he downloaded
											a file, and then he printed it
											on this printer.
											So this idea that you can
											manufacture objects
											digitally using these machines
											is something that The Economist magazine
											defined as the Third Industrial Revolution.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Actually, I argue that there is another revolution
											going on, and it&#39;s the one that has to do with
											open-source hardware and the maker&#39;s movement,
											because the printer that my friend used
											to print the toy is actually open-source.
											So you go to the same website, you can download all the files
											that you need in order to make that printer:
											the construction files, the hardware, the software,
											all the instruction is there.
											And also this is part of a large
											community where there are thousands of people
											around the world that are actually
											making these kinds of printers,
											and there&#39;s a lot of innovation
											happening because it&#39;s all open-source.
											You don&#39;t need anybody&#39;s permission to create something great.
											And that space is like
											the personal computer in 1976,
											like the Apples with the other companies are fighting,
											and we will see in a few years,
											there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, there&#39;s also another interesting thing.
											I said the electronics are open-source, because at the heart
											of this printer there is something I&#39;m really attached to:
											these Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of
											powers this printer, is a project
											I&#39;ve been working on for the past seven years.
											It&#39;s an open-source project.
											I worked with these friends of mine that I have here.
											So the five of us, two Americans, two Italians
											and a Spaniard, we — (Laughter)
											You know, it&#39;s a worldwide project. (Laughter)
											So we came together in this
											design institute called the Interaction Design Institute
											Ivrea, which was teaching
											interaction design, this idea that you can take
											design from the simple shape
											of an object and you can move it
											forward to design the way you interact with things.
											Well, when you design an object that&#39;s supposed to interact
											with a human being, if you make a foam model
											of a mobile phone, it doesn&#39;t make any sense.
											You have to have something that
											actually interacts with people.
											So, we worked on Arduino and
											a lot of other projects there to
											create platforms that would be
											simple for our students to use,
											so that our students could just build things that worked,
											but they don&#39;t have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So how do I make something that even a kid can use?
											And actually, with Arduino,
											we have kids like Sylvia that you see here,
											that actually make projects with Arduino.
											I have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me
											stuff they built for Arduino that&#39;s really
											scary to see the capabilities
											that kids have when you give them the tools.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let&#39;s look at what happens when you make a tool
											that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly,
											so one of the examples that I like to sort of
											kick off this discussion is this
											example of this cat feeder.
											The gentleman who made this project had two cats.
											One was sick and the other one
											was healthy, so he had to make
											sure they ate the proper food.
											So he made this thing that recognizes the cat
											from a chip mounted inside
											on the collar of the cat, and opens the door
											and the cat can eat the food.
											This is made by recycling an old CD player
											that you can get from an old computer,
											some cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs,
											and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something
											that you cannot find on the market.
											And I like this phrase: &quot;Scratch your own itch.&quot;
											If you have an idea, you just go and you make it.
											This is the equivalent of sketching on paper
											done with electronics.

											So one of the features that I
											think is important about our work
											is that our hardware, on top of
											being made with love in Italy —
											as you can see from the
											back of the circuit — (Laughter)
											is that it&#39;s open,
											so we publish all the design
											files for the circuit online,
											so you can download it and
											you can actually use it to
											make something, or to modify, to learn.
											You know, when I was learning about programming,
											I learned by looking at other people&#39;s code,
											or looking at other people&#39;s circuits in magazines.
											And this is a good way to learn,
											by looking at other people&#39;s work.
											So the different elements of the project are all open,
											so the hardware is released
											with a Creative Commons license.
											So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes
											like a piece of culture that you share
											and you build upon, like it was
											a song or a poem with Creative Commons.
											Or, the software is GPL, so it&#39;s open-source as well.
											The documentation and the hands-on teaching
											methodology is also open-source and released as the Creative Commons.
											Just the name is protected so
											that we can make sure that we can tell people
											what is Arduino and what isn&#39;t.

											Now, Arduino itself is made of
											a lot of different open-source components
											that maybe individually are hard to use for
											a 12-year-old kid, so Arduino
											wraps everything together into
											a mashup of open-source technologies
											where we try to give them the
											best user experience to get something done quickly.

											So you have situations like this,
											where some people in Chile
											decided to make their own boards instead of buying them,
											to organize a workshop and
											to save money. Or there are
											companies that make their own
											variations of Arduino that fit
											in a certain market, and there&#39;s
											probably, maybe like a 150 of them
											or something at the moment.
											This one is made by a company
											called Adafruit, which is run by
											this woman called Limor Fried,
											also known as Ladyada, who is
											one of the heroes of the open-source hardware movement
											and the maker movement.
											So, this idea that you have a new, sort of
											turbo-charged DIY community
											that believes in open-source,
											in collaboration, collaborates
											online, collaborates in different spaces.
											There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered
											all these people and sort of put them together
											as a community, and you see
											a very technical project explained in a
											very simple language, beautifully typeset.
											Or you have websites,
											like this one, like Instructables,
											where people actually teach each other about anything.
											So this one is about Arduino projects,
											the page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can
											learn how to make a cake and everything else.
											So let&#39;s look at some projects.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So this one is a quadcopter.
											It&#39;s a small model helicopter.
											In a way, it&#39;s a toy, no?
											And so this one was military technology
											a few years ago, and now it&#39;s
											open-source, easy to use, you can buy it online.
											DIY Drones is the community; they do this thing called ArduCopter.
											But then somebody actually launched this start-up called
											Matternet, where they figured out that you could
											use this to actually transport
											things from one village to another in Africa,
											and the fact that this was easy to find,
											open-source, easy to hack, enabled them
											to prototype their company really quickly.
											Or, other projects. Matt Richardson: I&#39;m getting a little sick
											of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over
											again, so I decided to do something about it.
											This Arduino project,
											which I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime
											any of these over-exposed
											personalities is mentioned. (Laughter)
											I&#39;ll show you how I made it. (Applause)
											MB: Check this out.
											MR: Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier
											today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her —
											MB: Eh? (Laughter)
											MR: It should do a pretty good
											job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details
											of Kim Kardashian&#39;s wedding.
											MB: Okay. So, you know, again, what is interesting here
											is that Matt found this module
											that lets Arduino process
											TV signals, he found some code
											written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV,
											put it together and then created this great project.

											It&#39;s also used, Arduino&#39;s used,
											in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider.
											There&#39;s some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of
											measuring some parameters.
											Or it&#39;s used for —
											(Music)
											So this is a musical interface
											built by a student from Italy,
											and he&#39;s now turning this into
											a product. Because it was a
											student project becoming a product.
											Or it can be used to make an assistive device.
											This is a glove that understands
											the sign language and transforms
											the gestures you make into sounds
											and writes the words that you&#39;re signing on a display
											And again, this is made of all different parts you can find
											on all the websites that sell Arduino-compatible parts,
											and you assemble it into a project.
											Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU,
											where they met with this boy
											who has a severe disability, cannot play with the PS3,
											so they built this device that
											allows the kid to play baseball
											although he has limited
											movement capability.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Or you can find it in arts projects.
											So this is the txtBomber.
											So you put a message into this device
											and then you roll it on the wall, and it basically
											has all these solenoids
											pressing the buttons on spray cans,
											so you just pull it over a wall
											and it just writes on the wall
											all the political messages.
											So, yeah. (Applause)
											Then we have this plant here.
											This is called Botanicalls,
											because there&#39;s an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module
											in the plant, and it&#39;s measuring
											the well-being of the plant,
											and it&#39;s creating a Twitter account
											where you can actually interact with the plant. (Laughter)
											So, you know, this plant
											will start to say, &quot;This is really hot,&quot; or
											there&#39;s a lot of, you know, &quot;I need water right now.&quot; (Laughter)
											So it just gives a personality to your plant.
											Or this is something that twitters when the
											baby inside the belly of a
											pregnant woman kicks. (Laughter)
											Or this is a 14-year-old kid in
											Chile who made a system that
											detects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter.
											He has 280,000 followers.
											He&#39;s 14 and he anticipated
											a governmental project by one year. (Applause)
											Or again, another project where,
											by analyzing the Twitter feed
											of a family, you can basically
											point where they are, like in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movie.
											So you can find out everything about this project on the website.
											Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts. (Laughter)
											It&#39;s interesting how, in 2009,
											Gizmodo basically defined,
											said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter,
											so it was — a lot changed in between. (Laughter)

									<p>
											So very serious project.
											When the Fukushima disaster happened,
											a bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information
											that the government was giving wasn&#39;t really open
											and really reliable, so they built
											this Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network
											interface. They made 100
											of them and gave them to people around Japan, and essentially
											the data that they gathered gets published on this website
											called Cosm, another website
											they built, so you can actually get reliable real-time
											information from the field,
											and you can get unbiased information.
											Or this machine here, it&#39;s from
											the DIY bio movement,
											and it&#39;s one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA,
											and again, it&#39;s completely open-source from the ground up.
											Or you have students in developing countries making
											replicas of scientific instruments that cost
											a lot of money to make.
											Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less
											using Arduino and a few parts.
											This is a pH probe.
											Or you get kids, like these kids, they&#39;re from Spain.
											They learned how to program and to make robots when they
											were probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino
											to make these robots that play football. They became
											world champions by making an Arduino-based robot.
											And so when we had to make
											our own educational robot, we just went to them and said,
											you know, &quot;You design it, because you know exactly
											what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids.&quot;
											Not me. I&#39;m an old guy.
											What am I supposed to excite, huh? (Laughter)
											But as I — in terms of educational assets. (Laughter)

											There&#39;s also companies like Google
											that are using the technology
											to create interfaces between
											mobile phones, tablets and the real world.
											So the Accessory Development Kit
											from Google is open-source
											and based on Arduino, as opposed
											to the one from Apple which is
											closed-source, NDA, sign your
											life to Apple. Here you are.
											There&#39;s a giant maze, and Joey&#39;s sitting there, and the

									<p>
											Also, I come from Italy, and the design is important
											in Italy, and yet very conservative.
											So we worked with a design
											studio called Habits, in Milan,
											to make this mirror, which is completely open-source.
											This doubles also as an iPod speaker.
											So the idea is that the hardware, the software,
											the design of the object, the fabrication,
											everything about this project is open-source
											and you can make it yourself.
											So we want other designers to pick this up and learn how
											to make great devices, to learn
											how to make interactive products
											by starting from something real.

											But when you have this idea,
											you know, what happens to all these ideas?
											There&#39;s, like, thousands of ideas that I —
											You know, it would take seven hours for me to do
											all the presentations.
											I will not take all the seven hours. Thank you.
											But let&#39;s start from this example:
											So, the group of people
											that started this company called Pebble, they prototyped
											a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone,
											and you can display information
											on it. And they prototyped with
											an old LCD screen from a Nokia
											mobile phone and an Arduino.
											And then, when they had a final
											project, they actually went to Kickstarter
											and they were asking for 100,000 dollars to make
											a few of them to sell.
											They got 10 million dollars.
											They got a completely
											fully funded start-up, and they don&#39;t have to,
											you know, get VCs involved or anything,
											just excite the people with their great project.

											The last project I want to show you is this:
											It&#39;s called ArduSat. It&#39;s currently on Kickstarter,
											so if you want to contribute, please do it.
											It&#39;s a satellite that goes into space, which is probably
											the least open-source thing you can imagine,
											and it contains an Arduino
											connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino,
											you can actually upload your experiments
											into this satellite and run them.
											So imagine, if you as a high school can have the satellite
											for a week and do satellite
											space experiments like that.
