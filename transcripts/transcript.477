											Because of what I&#39;m about to say,

											When I was a small boy, I took my pledge
											as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste
											the natural resources of my country,
											its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.
											And I&#39;ve stuck to that.
											Stanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.
											1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was &quot;mister natural&quot; for a while.

											And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.
											The Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,
											basically leveled the energy efficiency of California,
											so it&#39;s the same now, 30 years later,
											even though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.
											And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.
											California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.

											This year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I&#39;ll preview today,
											called Whole Earth Discipline.
											The dominant demographic event of our time
											is this screamingly rapid urbanization
											that we have going on.
											By mid-century we&#39;ll be about 80 percent urban,
											and that&#39;s mostly in the developing world,
											where that&#39;s happening.
											It&#39;s interesting, because history is driven to a large degree
											by the size of cities.
											The developing world now has all of the biggest cities,
											and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,
											and nine times bigger.
											It&#39;s qualitatively different.
											They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.

											1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.
											Well we now have a distribution of urban power
											similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
											In other words, the rise of the West,
											dramatic as it was, is over.
											The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:
											1.3 million people a week coming to town,
											decade after decade.
											What&#39;s really going on?
											Well, what&#39;s going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.
											Subsistence farming is drying up basically.

											(Laughter)
											Because in town —
											this is the bustling squatter city
											of Kibera, near Nairobi —

											It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,

											So in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,

											Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.

											The answer is, &quot;Everything.&quot;
											This is better than a mall. It&#39;s much denser.
											It&#39;s much more interactive.
											And the scale is terrific.
											The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.
											These are people busy getting out of poverty
											just as fast as they can.
											They&#39;re helping each other do it.
											They&#39;re doing it through an outlaw thing,
											the informal economy.
											The informal economy, it&#39;s sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:
											it&#39;s not supposed to be there, but it&#39;s huge.
											We don&#39;t understand how it works yet, but we have to.

											Furthermore, people in the informal economy,
											the gray economy —

											or they can join the legitimate world.
											We should be able to make that choice

											In Dharavi the slum performs not only
											a lot of services for itself,

											And one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.
											Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers

											Because people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster

											And when they&#39;re gone the natural environment
											starts to come back very rapidly.
											And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops

											As we have more and more old people, like me,

											What you&#39;re getting is a world which is

											Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate.
											The climate news, I&#39;m sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse
											than we think, faster than we think.
											Climate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system,
											full of runaway positive feedbacks,
											hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.
											Here&#39;s just a few samples.
											We&#39;re going to keep being surprised. And almost all

											From your standpoint this means

											as we&#39;re seeing in Darfur.
											That&#39;s what drought does.

											Shift to the power situation.
											Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,
											or a city planet.
											So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:
											coal, some gas,
											nuclear and hydro.
											Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.
											Coal is what is causing the climate problems.
											And everyone will keep burning it
											because it&#39;s so cheap, until governments make it expensive.
											Wind and solar can&#39;t help, because so far we don&#39;t have a way to store that energy.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So with hydro maxed out,
											coal and lose the climate,
											or nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,
											and maybe save the climate.
											And if we can eventually get good solar in space,
											that also could help.
											Because remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world
											in the villages and in the cities.

									<p>
											So, between coal and nuclear,
											compare their waste products.
											If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,
											the amount of waste that would be added up
											would fit in a Coke can.
											Whereas a coal-burning plant,
											a normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,
											each car having 100 tons.
											And it puts 18 thousand tons
											of carbon dioxide in the air.
											So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions
											of these various energy forms,
											nuclear is about even with solar and wind,
											and ahead of solar —
											oh, I&#39;m sorry — with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.

											And does nuclear really compete with coal?
											Just ask the coal miners in Australia.
											That&#39;s where you see some of the source,

											Well the good news is that
											the developing world, but frankly, the whole world,

											I want to point out one interesting thing,
											which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.
											It&#39;s supposed to be, I don&#39;t know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,

											The Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors,
											for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.
											And they&#39;re selling these floating reactors,
											only 35 megawatts, to developing countries.
											Here&#39;s the design of an early one from Toshiba.
											It&#39;s interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt,
											25 million watts,
											and you compare it to the standard big iron
											of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva,
											which is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.
											These things are way smaller. They&#39;re much more adaptable.
											Here&#39;s an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.
											Here&#39;s another American design that came out

											Almost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.
											They&#39;re typically buried in the ground.
											And the innovation is moving very rapidly.
											So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.
											In terms of proliferation,
											nuclear energy has done more
											to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.
											And that&#39;s why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,
											20 percent of electricity
											in this room is probably nuclear.
											Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,
											soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.
											And so I would like to see the GNEP program,
											that was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.
											And I was glad to see that president Obama
											supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy
											when he spoke in Prague the other week.

											One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops,
											in my view, as a biologist,
											have no reason to be controversial.
											My fellow environmentalists, on this subject,
											have been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.
											Despite their best efforts,
											genetically engineered crops are the most
											rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.
											They&#39;re good for the environment because they enable no-till farming,
											which leaves the soil in place,
											getting healthier from year to year —
											slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil
											into the atmosphere.
											They reduce pesticide use.
											And they increase yield, which allows you to have your
											agricultural area be smaller,
											and therefore more wild area is freed up.

											Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary.
											There will be events,
											like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave,
											which happened a while back.
											Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.
											Like wars over water,

											But there&#39;s this little problem with geoengineering:
											what body is going to decide
											who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?
											Because everybody is downstream,
											downwind of whatever is done.
											And if we just taboo it completely
											we could lose civilization.
											But if we just say &quot;OK,
											China, you&#39;re worried, you go ahead.
											You geoengineer your way. We&#39;ll geoengineer our way.&quot;

											Here is an example that climatologists like a lot,

											This one came from the sulfur dioxide

											cooled the earth by half a degree.
											There was so much ice in 1992, the following year,
											that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs
											who were known as the Pinatubo cubs.
											To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere

									<p>
											Just to run by another one:
											this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds,
											by atomizing seawater;
											that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.
											A nice one, because it can happen
											lots of little ways in lots of little places,
											is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians
											who made good agricultural soil

											So here is where we are.
											Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen
