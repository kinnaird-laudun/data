											How would you like to be better than you are?
											Suppose I said
											that, with just a few changes in your genes,
											you could get a better memory —
											more precise,
											more accurate and quicker.
											Or maybe you&#39;d like to be more fit, stronger,
											with more stamina.
											Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?
											How about living longer with good health?
											Or perhaps you&#39;re one of those
											who&#39;s always yearned for more creativity.
											Which one would you like the most?
											Which would you like, if you could have just one?
											(Audience Member: Creativity.)
											Creativity.
											How many people would choose creativity?
											Raise your hands. Let me see.
											A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.
											(Laughter) That&#39;s very good.
											How many would opt for memory?
											Quite a few more.
											How about fitness?
											A few less.
											What about longevity?
											Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
											If you could have any one of these,
											it would be a very different world.
											Is it just imaginary?
											Or, is it, perhaps, possible?

											Evolution has been a perennial topic
											here at the TED Conference,
											but I want to give you today
											one doctor&#39;s take on the subject.
											The great 20th-century geneticist,
											T.G. Dobzhansky,
											who was also a communicant
											in the Russian Orthodox Church,
											once wrote an essay that he titled
											&quot;Nothing in Biology Makes Sense
											Except in the Light of Evolution.&quot;
											Now if you are one of those
											who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution,
											this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid,
											take out your personal communications device —
											I give you permission —
											and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz&#39;s book on being wrong,
											because nothing in the rest of this talk
											is going to make any sense whatsoever to you.
											(Laughter)
											But if you do accept
											biological evolution,
											consider this:
											is it just about the past,
											or is it about the future?
											Does it apply to others,
											or does it apply to us?

											This is another look at the tree of life.
											In this picture,
											I&#39;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions,
											because if you look at the edges
											of the tree of life,
											every existing species
											at the tips of those branches
											has succeeded in evolutionary terms:
											it has survived;
											it has demonstrated a fitness
											to its environment.
											The human part of this branch,
											way out on one end,
											is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.
											We branch off of a common ancestor
											to modern chimpanzees
											about six or eight million years ago.
											In the interval,
											there have been perhaps 20 or 25
											different species of hominids.
											Some have come and gone.
											We have been here for about 130,000 years.
											It may seem like we&#39;re quite remote
											from other parts of this tree of life,
											but actually, for the most part,
											the basic machinery of our cells
											is pretty much the same.

											Do you realize that we can take advantage
											and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium
											to produce the protein of human insulin
											used to treat diabetics?
											This is not like human insulin;
											this is the same protein
											that is chemically indistinguishable
											from what comes out of your pancreas.
											And speaking of bacteria,
											do you realize that each of us carries in our gut
											more bacteria
											than there are cells in the rest of our body?
											Maybe 10 times more.
											I mean think of it,
											when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,
											do you think about the bacteria?
											Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment
											for those bacteria.
											It&#39;s warm, it&#39;s dark, it&#39;s moist,
											it&#39;s very cozy.
											And you&#39;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want
											with no effort on their part.
											It&#39;s really like an Easy Street for bacteria,
											with the occasional interruption
											of the unintended forced rush to the exit.
											But otherwise,
											you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,
											just as they are essential to your life.
											They help in the digestion of essential nutrients,
											and they protect you against certain diseases.

											But what will come in the future?
											Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise
											as a species?
											Or, are we destined
											to become something different —
											something, perhaps, even better adapted
											to the environment?
											Now let&#39;s take a step back in time
											to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago —
											the Earth, the solar system,
											about four and a half billion years —
											the first signs of proto-life,
											maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth —
											the first multi-celled organisms,
											perhaps as much
											as 800 or a billion years ago —
											and then the human species,
											finally emerging
											in the last 130,000 years.
											In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,
											life on Earth is like a brief measure;
											the animal kingdom,
											like a single measure;
											and human life,
											a small grace note.
											That was us.
											That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,
											so I hope you enjoyed it.

											Now when I was a freshman in college,
											I took my first biology class.
											I was fascinated
											by the elegance and beauty of biology.
											I became enamored of the power of evolution,
											and I realized something very fundamental:
											in most of the existence of life
											in single-celled organisms,
											each cell simply divides,
											and all of the genetic energy of that cell
											is carried on in both daughter cells.
											But at the time multi-celled organisms come online,
											things start to change.
											Sexual reproduction enters the picture.
											And very importantly,
											with the introduction of sexual reproduction
											that passes on the genome,
											the rest of the body
											becomes expendable.
											In fact, you could say
											that the inevitability of the death of our bodies
											enters in evolutionary time
											at the same moment
											as sexual reproduction.

											Now I have to confess,
											when I was a college undergraduate,
											I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex —
											it seemed pretty reasonable at the time,
											but with each passing year,
											I&#39;ve come to have increasing doubts.
											I&#39;ve come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,
											who was performing still in Las Vegas
											well into his 90s.
											And one night, there&#39;s a knock at his hotel room door.
											He answers the door.
											Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.
											She looks at him and says,
											&quot;I&#39;m here for super sex.&quot;
											&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; says George, &quot;I&#39;ll take the soup.&quot;

											I came to realize,
											as a physician,
											that I was working toward a goal
											which was different from the goal of evolution —
											not necessarily contradictory, just different.
											I was trying to preserve the body.
											I wanted to keep us healthy.
											I wanted to restore health from disease.
											I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.
											Evolution is all about passing on the genome
											to the next generation,
											adapting and surviving
											through generation after generation.
											From an evolutionary point of view,
											you and I are like the booster rockets
											designed to send the genetic payload
											into the next level of orbit
											and then drop off into the sea.
											I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed

											I want to achieve it through not dying.&quot;

											Evolution does not necessarily
											favor the longest-lived.
											It doesn&#39;t necessarily favor the biggest
											or the strongest or the fastest,
											and not even the smartest.
											Evolution favors
											those creatures best adapted
											to their environment.
											That is the sole test
											of survival and success.
											At the bottom of the ocean,
											bacteria that are thermophilic
											and can survive at the steam vent heat
											that would otherwise produce, if fish were there,
											sous-vide cooked fish,
											nevertheless, have managed
											to make that a hospitable environment for them.

											So what does this mean,
											as we look back at what has happened in evolution,
											and as we think about the place again
											of humans in evolution,
											and particularly as we look ahead
											to the next phase,
											I would say
											that there are a number of possibilities.
											The first is that we will not evolve.
											We have reached
											a kind of equipoise.
											And the reasoning behind that would be,
											first, we have, through medicine,
											managed to preserve a lot of genes
											that would otherwise be selected out
											and be removed from the population.
											And secondly, we as a species
											have so configured our environment
											that we have managed to make it adapt to us
											as well as we adapt to it.
											And by the way, we immigrate and circulate
											and intermix so much
											that you can&#39;t any longer
											have the isolation that is necessary
											for evolution to take place.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											A second possibility
											is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,
											natural, imposed by the forces of nature.
											And the argument here would be
											that the wheels of evolution grind slowly,
											but they are inexorable.
											And as far as isolation goes,
											when we as a species
											do colonize distant planets,
											there will be the isolation and the environmental changes
											that could produce evolution
											in the natural way.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But there&#39;s a third possibility,
											an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.
											I call it neo-evolution —
											the new evolution
											that is not simply natural,
											but guided and chosen
											by us as individuals
											in the choices that we will make.
											Now how could this come about?
											How could it be possible that we would do this?
											Consider, first, the reality
											that people today, in some cultures,
											are making choices about their offspring.
											They&#39;re, in some cultures,
											choosing to have more males than females.
											It&#39;s not necessarily good for the society,
											but it&#39;s what the individual and the family are choosing.

									<p>
											Think also,
											if it were possible ever
											for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,
											but for you in your body
											to make the genetic adjustments
											that would cure or prevent diseases.
											What if you could make the genetic changes
											to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer&#39;s
											or reduce the risk of cancer
											or eliminate stroke?
											Wouldn&#39;t you want
											to make those changes
											in your genes?
											If we look ahead,
											these kind of changes
											are going to be increasingly possible.

											The Human Genome Project
											started in 1990,
											and it took 13 years.
											It cost 2.7 billion dollars.
											The year after it was finished in 2004,
											you could do the same job
											for 20 million dollars in three to four months.
											Today, you can have a complete sequence
											of the three billion base pairs in the human genome
											at a cost of about 20,000 dollars
											and in the space of about a week.
											It won&#39;t be very long
											before the reality will be
											the 1,000-dollar human genome,
											and it will be increasingly available for everyone.
											Just a week ago,
											the National Academy of Engineering
											awarded its Draper Prize
											to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer,
											two scientists who independently developed techniques
											to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster
											and to lead to desirable proteins
											in a more efficient way —
											what Frances Arnold calls &quot;directed evolution.&quot;
											A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize
											was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka
											for his research
											in which he took an adult skin cell,
											a fibroblast,
											and by manipulating just four genes,
											he induced that cell
											to revert to a pluripotential stem cell —
											a cell potentially capable
											of becoming any cell in your body.

											These changes are coming.
											The same technology

											can make viruses
											that will not only protect you against themselves,
											but induce immunity against other viruses.
											Believe it or not,
											there&#39;s an experimental trial going on

											These are all reality today,
											and [in] the future, will be evermore possible.
											Imagine then
											just two other little changes.
											You can change the cells in your body,
											but what if you could change the cells in your offspring?
											What if you could change the sperm and the ova,
											or change the newly fertilized egg,
											and give your offspring a better chance
											at a healthier life —
											eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,
											reduce the risk of cancer?
											Who doesn&#39;t want healthier children?
											And then, that same analytic technology,
											that same engine of science
											that can produce
											the changes to prevent disease,
											will also enable us
											to adopt super-attributes,
											hyper-capacities —
											that better memory.
											Why not have the quick wit
											of a Ken Jennings,
											especially if you can augment it
											with the next generation of the Watson machine?
											Why not have the quick twitch muscle
											that will enable you to run faster and longer?
											Why not live longer?

									<p>
											And when we are at a position
											where we can pass it on to the next generation,
											and we can adopt the attributes we want,
											we will have converted
											old-style evolution
											into neo-evolution.
											We&#39;ll take a process
											that normally might require 100,000 years,
											and we can compress it down to a thousand years —
											and maybe even in the next 100 years.
											These are choices
											that your grandchildren,
											or their grandchildren,
											are going to have before them.
											Will we use these choices
											to make a society that is better,
											that is more successful, that is kinder?
											Or, will we selectively choose different attributes
											that we want for some of us
											and not for others of us?
											Will we make a society
											that is more boring and more uniform,
											or more robust and more versatile?
											These are the kinds of questions

How do we decide which treatment to use in a tricky case -- both individually and as a community? Is it fair that the richest hospitals get the best healthcare? Who should bear the risk (and gain the reward) of trying the newest treatments?<br /><br />Fineberg helped found and served as president of the Society for Medical Decision Making and also served as consultant to the World Health Organization. He was provost of Harvard from 1997 to 2001, following thirteen years as Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. He has devoted most of his academic career to the fields of health policy and medical decision making. His past research has focused on the process of policy development and implementation, assessment of medical technology, evaluation and use of vaccines, and dissemination of medical innovations.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Harvey Fineberg","tags":["evolution","medicine","philosophy","science","technology","bioethics","marine biology"],"title":"Are we ready for neo-evolution?","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1036830}]}
