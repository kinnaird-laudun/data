											Metaphor lives a secret life all around us.
											We utter about six metaphors a minute.
											Metaphorical thinking is essential
											to how we understand ourselves and others,
											how we communicate, learn, discover
											and invent.
											But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, to assist me in explaining this,
											I&#39;ve enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers,
											the reigning king of the metaphorians,
											a man whose contributions to the field
											are so great that he himself
											has become a metaphor.
											I am, of course, referring to none other
											than Elvis Presley.
											(Laughter)
									</p>

											Now, &quot;All Shook Up&quot; is a great love song.
											It&#39;s also a great example of how
											whenever we deal with anything abstract —
											ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts —
											we inevitably resort to metaphor.
											In &quot;All Shook Up,&quot; a touch is not a touch, but a chill.
											Lips are not lips, but volcanoes.
											She is not she, but a buttercup.
											And love is not love, but being all shook up.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In this, Elvis is following Aristotle&#39;s classic definition of metaphor
											as the process of giving the thing
											a name that belongs to something else.
											This is the mathematics of metaphor.
											And fortunately it&#39;s very simple.
											X equals Y.
											(Laughter)
											This formula works wherever metaphor is present.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare
											in this famous line from &quot;Romeo and Juliet:&quot;
											Juliet is the sun.
											Now, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet,
											a name that belongs to something else, the sun.
											But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else,
											we give it a whole network of analogies too.
											We mix and match what we know about the metaphor&#39;s source,
											in this case the sun,
											with what we know about its target, Juliet.
											And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet
											than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.

									<p>
											So, how do we make and understand metaphors?
											This might look familiar.
											The first step is pattern recognition.
											Look at this image. What do you see?
											Three wayward Pac-Men,
											and three pointy brackets are actually present.
											What we see, however,
											are two overlapping triangles.
											Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns;
											it is the creation of patterns.
											Second step, conceptual synesthesia.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ
											in another sense organ as well,
											such as colored hearing.
											People with colored hearing
											actually see colors when they hear the sounds
											of words or letters.
											We all have synesthetic abilities.
											This is the Bouba/Kiki test.
											What you have to do is identify which of these shapes
											is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.
											(Laughter)
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											If you are like 98 percent of other people,
											you will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,
											and the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.
											Can we do a quick show of hands?
											Does that correspond?
											Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.
											Why do we do that?
											Because we instinctively find, or create,
											a pattern between the round shape
											and the round sound of Bouba,
											and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.

									<p>
											And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.
											Silence is sweet.
											Neckties are loud.
											Sexually attractive people are hot.
											Sexually unattractive people leave us cold.
											Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,
											in which we understand one concept
											in the context of another.

											Researchers asked a group of people

											If, for example, house prices

											Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions

											What should they do?
											Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?

											Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy:

											That&#39;s routinely translated as, &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;
											But there is a better translation.
											The Latin word &quot;cogito&quot;
											is derived from the prefix &quot;co,&quot; meaning &quot;together,&quot;
											and the verb &quot;agitare,&quot; meaning &quot;to shake.&quot;
											So, the original meaning of &quot;cogito&quot;

											The mind is a plastic snow dome,

Born in Lvov, a city that in 1909 was in southeastern Poland but is now part of Ukraine, Lec came from a wealthy and aristocratic family. With the dismantling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, he and his family lost most of their money and privileges. When World War II broke out, Lec was sent to a concentration camp in Tarnopol. He survived there for two years, until he managed to escape by donning a stolen German uniform. Back in Warsaw, he joined the communist resistance, first as an editor of underground periodicals and then as part of the guerrilla movement.  After the war, Lec remained affiliated with the communists, serving as the press attaché at the Polish consulate in Vienna from 1946 to 1950. But he gradually grew disillusioned with communism. In his aphorisms, Lec parodied the feel-good platitudes and propaganda put out by the communist party machine. 'Why do I write these short aphorisms?' he once asked. 'Because words fail me!' One of the greatest aphorists of the 20th century, Lec is hard to find in English translation.
