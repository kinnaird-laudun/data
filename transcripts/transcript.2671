Also featuring &quot;Moneyball&quot; author Michael Lewis and Brad Stevens, coach of the Boston Celtics. This episode is brought to you by JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co, Accenture, Bonobos and Warby Parker. (Audio only)" />

<meta content='The Butler Bulldogs have a habit of shocking college basketball fans by beating top teams with far more talent. How do they do it? Adam Grant joins the team to talk about why stars are overrated and role players are underrated — and how humility can go hand in hand with confidence.

											Today, humility,
											a hidden ingredient in great teams.
											When it&#39;s time to put together a team,
											most people look for the best talent.
											I hear it in every industry.
											We don&#39;t take B players, only A players.
											But what actually happens
when you have a whole team of stars?
											The evidence is pretty clear:
											no matter where you work,
having an entire team of superstars
											can be a total disaster.
											It turns out that if you have
a team of 10 people,
											you&#39;re better off
with six stars than eight.
											You see it on Wall Street.
											Teams with mostly top analysts
make worse financial recommendations
											than teams that have a mix
of stars and average performers.
											Same is true in soccer.
											National teams with too many top players
											are less likely to win World Cup
qualifying matches.
											And in a study of NBA basketball
											over a decade,
											teams with only three star players
											won more games
than teams with four or five.
											The star-studded teams had fewer assists,
missed more of their shots
											and grabbed fewer rebounds.
											The players struggled to coordinate.
											They all wanted to be the alpha dog.

											ML: Some of the things the stars do
are maybe not as valuable as we think.
											If you see a volume shooter,
a guy who scores a lot of points,
											but he might be scoring the points
and so he gets classified as a star,
											but he might be scoring
those points in a way
											that actually kind of hurts the team,
											taking lots of bad shots,
											not making a high percentage of his shots.
											Each time you&#39;re on a court,
only one person can take the shot.
											If what the star is is a scoring machine,

to have five of them on the court
											who are focused on that

that need to be done.

											AG: I was curious about
how Butler screens for character.
											Look, nobody wants
to reveal their trade secrets,

favorite recruiting questions.
											Butler scouts like to ask
high school players,
											would you rather be in a situation
where your team wins
											but you only score 5 points,
											or one where you score 20 points
but your team loses?
											When I met the Butler basketball players,
											it was pretty clear
which situation they preferred.

											because everyone can see

											AG: When you&#39;re the one talking,
											this can feel like an effective way
to show humility,
											but when you&#39;re listening
to someone else do it,
											it doesn&#39;t go over so well.
											There&#39;s evidence that humblebragging
causes people to like you less
											and see you as less competent.
											You&#39;re actually better off
just plain bragging,
											although if you were really that great,
											you wouldn&#39;t need to boast
about your greatness.
											People are especially annoyed
by bragging in a team.
											When you&#39;re working closely with others,
											showing humility signals that you&#39;re
here to do what&#39;s best for the group,
											not to impress the group.
											Acknowledging weaknesses
can gain the respect of your teammates.
											It can also help your team stay great.
											The more you achieve, the easier it gets
for success to go to your head.
											In the NBA, the very things
that help teams excel
											can eventually cause their downfall.
											It&#39;s a competency trap.
											Winning can cause them
to get too comfortable
											with their plays and routines,
											which makes them
more predictable to other teams.
											Humility stops us
from resting on our laurels.
											It prevents us from getting complacent.
											It keeps us focused on learning.
											Of course, it helps if the stars
on your team are humble too,
											so I went back to Michael Lewis
to find out what that takes.
											You spend a tremendous amount of time
around highly successful people,
											not just in sports but on Wall Street
and in other worlds of high achievers.
											What do you think it takes to maintain
humility in those kinds of worlds?

											ML: Even though I may spend time
around a lot of successful people,
											I don&#39;t spend a lot of time
around humility.
											I mean, they&#39;re successful,
but they aren&#39;t necessarily humble.
											And a lot of humility
is strategic humility.
											I mean, there&#39;s a lot of phony humility.
											Everybody who&#39;s not an idiot knows
that it&#39;s more attractive to seem humble
											than to seem arrogant,
											so even people who are deeply arrogant
											can manufacture some humility
for you on the surface.
											And I see a lot of that.
											To actually maintain real humility?
											The simple answer to that to me
is keeping people in your life
											who knew you when.
											If I had to identify the trait
											that the people I know
who are really successful have
											that kind of keeps them grounded
											is they have friends
from when they were 10 years old,
											people who know them
outside of their professional lives
											who can remind them that in many ways
they&#39;re normal human beings.
											What happens to people is when
they get swept up in arenas of ambition
											and they succeed in those arenas,
											it&#39;s very, very tempting
to let that arena tell you who you are.
											You&#39;re a superstar.
											So the trick is live outside the arena
											and recognize you&#39;re visiting the arena
for professional purposes.
