<title>Chetan Bhatt: Dare to refuse the origin myths that claim who you are | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We all have origin stories and identity myths, our tribal narratives that give us a sense of security and belonging. But sometimes our small-group identities can keep us from connecting with humanity as a whole -- and even keep us from seeing others as human. In a powerful talk about how we understand who we are, Chetan Bhatt challenges us to think creatively about each other and our future. As he puts it: it&#39;s time to change the question from &quot;Where are you from?&quot; to &quot;Where are you going?&quot;" />

<meta content='We all have origin stories and identity myths, our tribal narratives that give us a sense of security and belonging. But sometimes our small-group identities can keep us from connecting with humanity as a whole — and even keep us from seeing others as human. In a powerful talk about how we understand who we are, Chetan Bhatt challenges us to think creatively about each other and our future. As he puts it: it&#x0027;s time to change the question from "Where are you from?" to "Where are you going?"' itemprop='description'>

											Maybe that&#39;s why I find it hard

teenage refusal to be labeled.
											It&#39;s about our own most identities,

											the ones that we cheer for,
											the ones that we fight for,
											the ones that we love or hate.

											But our responses

											We see violent religious,
national and ethnic disputes.
											And often the conflict is based
on old stories of identity
											and belonging
											and origins.
											And these identities are based on myths,
											typically about ancient,
primordial origins.
											And these could be about Adam and Eve
											or about the supremacy
of a caste or gender
											or about the vitality of a supposed race
											or about the past glories
of an empire or civilization

											Now, people say

											They give us a sense of belonging.
											Identity is your cultural clothing,

warm and fuzzy inside.
											But does it really?
											Do we really need
identity myths to feel safe?

national, ethnic disputes

											Now, origin myths
are closely linked to tradition,

points to something old
											and permanent, almost natural,
											and people assume tradition
is just history,
											simply the past
condensed into a nice story.
											But let&#39;s not confuse
tradition with history.

											Origin stories are usually recently
created fictions of ancient belonging,

											I was brought up in the 1970s near Wembley

Irish families living in our street,

was massive then
											with regular marches and attacks on us
											and a permanent threat
											and often a frequent reality
of violence against us
											on the streets, in our homes,

											And I remember during a general election
a leaflet came through our letter box
											with a picture of the National Front
candidate for our area.

											There was a Hindu family
that we got to know well —
											and you have to understand
that life in our street
											was a little bit like the setting
for an Asian soap opera.
											Everyone knew everyone else&#39;s business,
											even if they didn&#39;t want it
to be known by anyone at all.
											You really had no choice in this matter.
											But in this family,
there was a quiet little boy
											who went to the same school as I did,
											and after I left school,
I didn&#39;t hear much more about him,
											except that he&#39;d gone off to India.
											Now around 2000,
											I remember seeing this short book.
											The book was unusual
											because it was written
by a British supporter of Al Qaeda,
											and in it the author calls
for attacks in Britain.
											This is in 1999,
											so 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq
was still in the future,
											and he helped scout
New York bombing targets.
											He taught others how to make a dirty bomb
to use on the London Underground,
											and he plotted a massive bombing campaign
in London&#39;s shopping areas.
											He&#39;s a very high-risk security
prisoner in the UK
											and one of the most important Al Qaeda
figures to be arrested in Britain.

											The author of that book
											was the very same quiet little boy
											who went to my school.
											So a Hindu boy from Britain
											became an Al Qaeda fighter
											and a most-wanted international terrorist,
											and he rejected what people would call
his Hindu or Indian or British identity,
											and he became someone else.
											He refused to be who he was.
											He recreated himself,
											and this kind of journey is very common
											for young men and women
											who become involved
in Al Qaeda or Islamic State
											or other transnational armed groups.
											Al Qaeda&#39;s media spokesman
is a white American
											from a Jewish and Catholic
mixed background,
											and neither he nor the boy from my school
											were from Muslim backgrounds.
											There&#39;s no point in asking them
where are they from.
											A more important question is
where they&#39;re going.

									<p>
											And I would also put it to you
											that exactly the same journey
occurs for those young men and women
											who were brought up
in Muslim family backgrounds.
											Most of those who join Al Qaeda
											and other Salafi jihadi groups
from Europe, Asia, North America,
											even in many cases the Middle East
											are those who have comprehensively
rejected their backgrounds
											to become, in essence, new people.
											They spend an enormous amount of time
attacking their parents&#39; backgrounds
											as profane, impure, blasphemous,
											the wrong type of Islam,
											and their vision instead
											is a fantastical view
of cosmic apocalypse.
											It&#39;s a born again vision.
											Discard your past,
your society, your family and friends
											since they&#39;re all impure.
											Instead, become someone else,
											your true self,
											your authentic self.
											Now, this isn&#39;t
about a return to the past.
											It&#39;s about using a forgery of the past
											to envision an appalling future
which begins today at year zero.
											This is why over 80 percent of the victims
of Al Qaeda and Islamic State
											are people from Muslim backgrounds.
											The first act by Salafi jihadi groups
when they take over an area
											is to destroy existing Muslim institutions
											including mosques,
shrines, preachers, practices.
											Their main purpose is to control
and punish people internally,
											to dictate the spaces that women may go,
											their clothing, family relations,
											beliefs, even the minute detail
of how one prays.
											And you get the impression in the news
											that they are after us in the West,
											but they are actually mainly after
people from other Muslim backgrounds.
											In their view, no other Muslim
can ever be pure enough,
											so ordinary beliefs and practices
that have existed for centuries
											are attacked as impure
											by teenagers from Birmingham or London
											who know nothing
											about the histories
that they so joyously obliterate.

											This is what the main Hindu
fundamentalist organization in India
											looks like today at its mass rally.
											Maybe it reminds you
of the 1930s in Italy or Germany,
											and the movement&#39;s roots
are indeed in fascism.
											It was a member of the same
Hindu fundamentalist movement
											who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi.
											Hindu fundamentalists today
view this murderer as a national hero,
											and they want to put up
statues of him throughout India.
											They&#39;ve been involved for decades
											in large-scale mass violence
against minorities.
											They ban books, art, films.
											They attack romantic couples
on Valentine&#39;s Day,
											Christians on Christmas Day.
											They don&#39;t like others talking critically
											about what they see
as their ancient culture
											or using its images
											or caricaturing it
											or drawing cartoons about it.
											But the people making
the strongest possible claims
											about ancient, timeless Hindu religion

											This is Abu al-Walid Muhammad
ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd,
											a very senior Muslim judge and thinker
in Cordoba in the 12th century,
											and his writings were considered
deeply blasphemous, heretical and evil.
											Long after he died,
											followers of his work
were ruthlessly hunted down,
											banished and killed over several centuries
											by the most powerful religious institution
of the medieval period.
											That institution was
the Roman Catholic Church.
											Why?
											Because ibn Rushd said
that something true in religion
											may conflict with something
											that your reason
finds to be true on earth,
											but the latter is still true.
											There are two distinct worlds of truth,
											one based on our reason and evidence,
and one that is divine,
											and the state, political power, social law
are in the realm of reason.
											Religious life is a different realm.
											They should be kept separated.
											Social and political life
should be governed by our reason,
											not by religion.
											And you can see why the church
was upset by his writings,
											as indeed were some Muslims
during his lifetime,
											because he gives us
a strong statement of secularism
											of a kind which is normal in Europe today.
