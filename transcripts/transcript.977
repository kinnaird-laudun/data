											Erez Lieberman Aiden: Everyone knows
											that a picture is worth a thousand words.
											But we at Harvard
											were wondering if this was really true.
											(Laughter)
											So we assembled a team of experts,
											spanning Harvard, MIT,
											The American Heritage Dictionary, The Encyclopedia Britannica
											and even our proud sponsors,
											the Google.
											And we cogitated about this
											for about four years.
											And we came to a startling conclusion.
											Ladies and gentlemen, a picture is not worth a thousand words.
											In fact, we found some pictures
											that are worth 500 billion words.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Jean-Baptiste Michel: So how did we get to this conclusion?
											So Erez and I were thinking about ways
											to get a big picture of human culture
											and human history: change over time.
											So many books actually have been written over the years.
											So we were thinking, well the best way to learn from them
											is to read all of these millions of books.
											Now of course, if there&#39;s a scale for how awesome that is,
											that has to rank extremely, extremely high.
											Now the problem is there&#39;s an X-axis for that,
											which is the practical axis.
											This is very, very low.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now people tend to use an alternative approach,
											which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully.
											This is extremely practical, but not so awesome.
											What you really want to do
											is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space.
											So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google
											who had started a digitization project a few years back
											that might just enable this approach.
											They have digitized millions of books.
											So what that means is, one could use computational methods
											to read all of the books in a click of a button.
											That&#39;s very practical and extremely awesome.

									<p>
											ELA: Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from.
											Since time immemorial, there have been authors.
											These authors have been striving to write books.
											And this became considerably easier
											with the development of the printing press some centuries ago.
											Since then, the authors have won
											on 129 million distinct occasions,
											publishing books.
											Now if those books are not lost to history,
											then they are somewhere in a library,
											and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries
											and digitized by Google,
											which has scanned 15 million books to date.

											Now when Google digitizes a book, they put it into a really nice format.
											Now we&#39;ve got the data, plus we have metadata.
											We have information about things like where was it published,
											who was the author, when was it published.
											And what we do is go through all of those records
											and exclude everything that&#39;s not the highest quality data.
											What we&#39;re left with

											Well of course, you want to take the books

											and you&#39;d say,
											&quot;Steve, you&#39;re an expert on the irregular verbs.
											What should I do?&quot;
											And he&#39;d tell you, &quot;Well most people say thrived,

											And you also knew, more or less,

											ELA: You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing.
											For instance, let me tell you the history
											of the year 1950.
											Pretty much for the vast majority of history,
											no one gave a damn about 1950.
											In 1700, in 1800, in 1900,
											no one cared.
											Through the 30s and 40s,
											no one cared.
											Suddenly, in the mid-40s,
											there started to be a buzz.
											People realized that 1950 was going to happen,
											and it could be big.
											(Laughter)
											But nothing got people interested in 1950
											like the year 1950.
											(Laughter)
											People were walking around obsessed.
											They couldn&#39;t stop talking
											about all the things they did in 1950,
											all the things they were planning to do in 1950,
											all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950.
											In fact, 1950 was so fascinating
											that for years thereafter,
											people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened,
											in &#39;51, &#39;52, &#39;53.
											Finally in 1954,
											someone woke up and realized
											that 1950 had gotten somewhat passé.
											(Laughter)
											And just like that, the bubble burst.

											is the story of every year that we have on record,

											And because we have these nice charts, we can measure things.
											We can say, &quot;Well how fast does the bubble burst?&quot;
											And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely.
											Equations were derived, graphs were produced,

											JM: Now a little piece of career advice.
											So for those of you who seek to be famous,
											we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures,
											authors, actors and so on.
											So if you want to become famous early on, you should be an actor,
											because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s —
											you&#39;re still young, it&#39;s really great.
											Now if you can wait a little bit, you should be an author,
											because then you rise to very great heights,
											like Mark Twain, for instance: extremely famous.
											But if you want to reach the very top,
											you should delay gratification
											and, of course, become a politician.
											So here you will become famous by the end of your 50s,
											and become very, very famous afterward.
											So scientists also tend to get famous when they&#39;re much older.
											Like for instance, biologists and physics
											tend to be almost as famous as actors.
											One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician.
											(Laughter)
											If you do that,
											you might think, &quot;Oh great. I&#39;m going to do my best work when I&#39;m in my 20s.&quot;
											But guess what, nobody will really care.

											ELA: There are more sobering notes
											among the n-grams.
											For instance, here&#39;s the trajectory of Marc Chagall,
											an artist born in 1887.
											And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person.
											He gets more and more and more famous,
											except if you look in German.
											If you look in German, you see something completely bizarre,
											something you pretty much never see,
											which is he becomes extremely famous
											and then all of a sudden plummets,
											going through a nadir between 1933 and 1945,
											before rebounding afterward.
											And of course, what we&#39;re seeing
											is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist
											in Nazi Germany.

											Now these signals
											are actually so strong
											that we don&#39;t need to know that someone was censored.
											We can actually figure it out
											using really basic signal processing.
											Here&#39;s a simple way to do it.
											Well, a reasonable expectation
											is that somebody&#39;s fame in a given period of time
											should be roughly the average of their fame before
											and their fame after.
											So that&#39;s sort of what we expect.
											And we compare that to the fame that we observe.
											And we just divide one by the other
											to produce something we call a suppression index.
											If the suppression index is very, very, very small,
											then you very well might be being suppressed.
											If it&#39;s very large, maybe you&#39;re benefiting from propaganda.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											JM: Now you can actually look at
											the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations.
											So for instance, here —
											this suppression index is for 5,000 people
											picked in English books where there&#39;s no known suppression —
											it would be like this, basically tightly centered on one.
											What you expect is basically what you observe.
											This is distribution as seen in Germany —
											very different, it&#39;s shifted to the left.
											People talked about it twice less as it should have been.
											But much more importantly, the distribution is much wider.
											There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution
											who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been.
											But then also many people on the far right
											who seem to benefit from propaganda.
											This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record.

											ELA: So culturomics
											is what we call this method.
											It&#39;s kind of like genomics.
											Except genomics is a lens on biology
											through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome.
											Culturomics is similar.
											It&#39;s the application of massive-scale data collection analysis
											to the study of human culture.
											Here, instead of through the lens of a genome,
											through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record.
											The great thing about culturomics
											is that everyone can do it.
											Why can everyone do it?
											Everyone can do it because three guys,
											Jon Orwant, Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google,
											saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer,
											and they said, &quot;This is so fun.
											We have to make this available for people.&quot;
											So in two weeks flat — the two weeks before our paper came out —
											they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public.
											And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you&#39;re interested in
											and see its n-gram immediately —

											JM: Now this was used over a million times on the first day,

											But it turns out in the 18th century, people didn&#39;t really care about that at all.
											They didn&#39;t want to be their best, they wanted to be their beft.
											So what happened is, of course, this is just a mistake.
											It&#39;s not that strove for mediocrity,
											it&#39;s just that the S used to be written differently, kind of like an F.
											Now of course, Google didn&#39;t pick this up at the time,
											so we reported this in the science article that we wrote.

											If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons
