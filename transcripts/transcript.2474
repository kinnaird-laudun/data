<title>Ray Dalio: How to build a company where the best ideas win | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What if you knew what your coworkers really thought about you and what they were really like? Ray Dalio makes the business case for using radical transparency and algorithmic decision-making to create an idea meritocracy where people can speak up and say what they really think -- even calling out the boss is fair game. Learn more about how these strategies helped Dalio create one of the world&#39;s most successful hedge funds and how you might harness the power of data-driven group decision-making." />

Ray Dalio makes the business case for using radical transparency and algorithmic decision-making to create an idea meritocracy where people can speak up and say what they really think — even calling out the boss is fair game.

											Whether you like it or not,
											radical transparency and algorithmic
decision-making is coming at you fast,
											and it&#39;s going to change your life.
											That&#39;s because it&#39;s now easy
to take algorithms
											and embed them into computers
											and gather all that data
that you&#39;re leaving on yourself
											all over the place,
											and know what you&#39;re like,
											and then direct the computers
to interact with you
											in ways that are better
than most people can.

											Well, that might sound scary.
											I&#39;ve been doing this for a long time

											My objective has been
to have meaningful work
											and meaningful relationships
with the people I work with,
											and I&#39;ve learned that I couldn&#39;t have that
											unless I had that radical transparency
and that algorithmic decision-making.
											I want to show you why that is,
											I want to show you how it works.

											Since I was a kid,
I&#39;ve had a terrible rote memory.
											And I didn&#39;t like following instructions,
											I was no good at following instructions.
											But I loved to figure out
how things worked for myself.
											When I was 12,
											I hated school but I fell in love
with trading the markets.
											I caddied at the time,
											earned about five dollars a bag.
											And I took my caddying money,
and I put it in the stock market.
											And that was just because
the stock market was hot at the time.
											And the first company I bought
											was a company by the name
of Northeast Airlines.
											Northeast Airlines was
the only company I heard of
											that was selling for less
than five dollars a share.

											And I figured I could buy more shares,
											and if it went up, I&#39;d make more money.
											So, it was a dumb strategy, right?
											But I tripled my money,
											and I tripled my money
because I got lucky.
											The company was about to go bankrupt,
											but some other company acquired it,
											and I tripled my money.
											And I was hooked.
											And I thought, &quot;This game is easy.&quot;

											I learned this game is anything but easy.

											In order to be an effective investor,
											one has to bet against the consensus
											and be right.
											And it&#39;s not easy to bet
against the consensus and be right.
											One has to bet against
the consensus and be right
											because the consensus
is built into the price.
											And in order to be an entrepreneur,
											a successful entrepreneur,
											one has to bet against
the consensus and be right.
											I had to be an entrepreneur
and an investor —
											and what goes along with that
is making a lot of painful mistakes.
											So I made a lot of painful mistakes,
											and with time,
											my attitude about those mistakes
began to change.
											I began to think of them as puzzles.
											That if I could solve the puzzles,
											they would give me gems.
											And the puzzles were:
											What would I do differently in the future
so I wouldn&#39;t make that painful mistake?
											And the gems were principles
											that I would then write down
so I would remember them
											that would help me in the future.
											And because I wrote them down so clearly,
											I could then —
											eventually discovered —
											I could then embed them into algorithms.
											And those algorithms
would be embedded in computers,
											and the computers would
make decisions along with me;
											and so in parallel,
we would make these decisions.
											And I could see how those decisions
then compared with my own decisions,
											and I could see that
those decisions were a lot better.
											And that was because the computer
could make decisions much faster,
											it could process a lot more information
											and it can process decisions much more —
											less emotionally.
											So it radically improved
my decision-making.

											Eight years after I started Bridgewater,
											I had my greatest failure,
											my greatest mistake.
											It was late 1970s,
											I was 34 years old,
											and I had calculated that American banks
											had lent much more money
to emerging countries
											than those countries
were going to be able to pay back
											and that we would have
the greatest debt crisis
											since the Great Depression.
											And with it, an economic crisis
											and a big bear market in stocks.
											It was a controversial view at the time.
											People thought it was
kind of a crazy point of view.
											But in August 1982,
											Mexico defaulted on its debt,
											and a number of other countries followed.

											I started to ask myself,
											&quot;How do I know I&#39;m right?&quot;
											I gained a humility that I needed
											in order to balance my audacity.
											I wanted to find the smartest
people who would disagree with me
											to try to understand their perspective
											or to have them
stress test my perspective.
											I wanted to make an idea meritocracy.
											In other words,
											not an autocracy in which
I would lead and others would follow
											and not a democracy in which everybody&#39;s
points of view were equally valued,
											but I wanted to have an idea meritocracy

											What I mean by radical truthfulness

											And we literally
tape almost all conversations

											because if we didn&#39;t do that,

an idea meritocracy.
											In order to have an idea meritocracy,

											So for that last 25 years
that&#39;s how we&#39;ve been operating.
											We&#39;ve been operating
with this radical transparency
											and then collecting these principles,
											largely from making mistakes,
											and then embedding
those principles into algorithms.
											And then those algorithms provide —
											we&#39;re following the algorithms
											in parallel with our thinking.
											That has been how we&#39;ve run
the investment business,

											In order to give you a glimmer
into what this looks like,
											I&#39;d like to take you into a meeting
											and introduce you to a tool of ours
called the &quot;Dot Collector&quot;
											that helps us do this.
											A week after the US election,
											our research team held a meeting
											to discuss what a Trump presidency
would mean for the US economy.
											Naturally, people had
different opinions on the matter
											and how we were
approaching the discussion.
											The &quot;Dot Collector&quot; collects these views.
											It has a list of a few dozen attributes,
											so whenever somebody thinks something
about another person&#39;s thinking,
											it&#39;s easy for them
to convey their assessment;
											they simply note the attribute
and provide a rating from one to 10.
											For example, as the meeting began,
											a researcher named Jen rated me a three —
											in other words, badly —

									<p>
											for not showing a good balance
of open-mindedness and assertiveness.
											As the meeting transpired,
											Jen&#39;s assessments of people
added up like this.
											Others in the room
have different opinions.
											That&#39;s normal.
											Different people are always
going to have different opinions.
											And who knows who&#39;s right?
											Let&#39;s look at just what people thought
about how I was doing.
											Some people thought I did well,
											others, poorly.
											With each of these views,
											we can explore the thinking
behind the numbers.
											Here&#39;s what Jen and Larry said.
											Note that everyone
gets to express their thinking,
											including their critical thinking,
											regardless of their position
in the company.
											Jen, who&#39;s 24 years old
and right out of college,
											can tell me, the CEO,
that I&#39;m approaching things terribly.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This tool helps people
both express their opinions
											and then separate themselves
from their opinions
											to see things from a higher level.
											When Jen and others shift their attentions
from inputting their own opinions
											to looking down on the whole screen,
											their perspective changes.
											They see their own opinions
as just one of many
											and naturally start asking themselves,
											&quot;How do I know my opinion is right?&quot;
											That shift in perspective is like going
from seeing in one dimension
											to seeing in multiple dimensions.
											And it shifts the conversation
from arguing over our opinions
											to figuring out objective criteria
for determining which opinions are best.

											Behind the &quot;Dot Collector&quot;
is a computer that is watching.
											It watches what all
these people are thinking
											and it correlates that
with how they think.
											And it communicates advice
back to each of them based on that.
											Then it draws the data
from all the meetings
											to create a pointilist painting
of what people are like
											and how they think.
											And it does that guided by algorithms.
											Knowing what people are like helps
to match them better with their jobs.
											For example,
											a creative thinker who is unreliable
											might be matched up with someone
who&#39;s reliable but not creative.
											Knowing what people are like
also allows us to decide
											what responsibilities to give them
											and to weigh our decisions
based on people&#39;s merits.
											We call it their believability.
											Here&#39;s an example of a vote that we took
											where the majority
of people felt one way ...
											but when we weighed the views
based on people&#39;s merits,
											the answer was completely different.
											This process allows us to make decisions
not based on democracy,
											not based on autocracy,
											but based on algorithms that take
people&#39;s believability into consideration.

one of the greatest tragedies of mankind,
											and that is people arrogantly,
											naïvely holding opinions
in their minds that are wrong,
											and acting on them,
											and not putting them out there
to stress test them.
											And that&#39;s a tragedy.
											And we do it because it elevates ourselves
above our own opinions
											so that we start to see things
through everybody&#39;s eyes,
											and we see things collectively.
											Collective decision-making is so much
better than individual decision-making

											So what&#39;s the problem
with being radically truthful
											and radically transparent with each other?
											People say it&#39;s emotionally difficult.
											Critics say it&#39;s a formula
for a brutal work environment.
											Neuroscientists tell me it has to do
with how are brains are prewired.
											There&#39;s a part of our brain
that would like to know our mistakes
											and like to look at our weaknesses
so we could do better.
											I&#39;m told that that&#39;s
the prefrontal cortex.
											And then there&#39;s a part of our brain
which views all of this as attacks.
											I&#39;m told that that&#39;s the amygdala.
											In other words,
there are two you&#39;s inside you:
											there&#39;s an emotional you
											and there&#39;s an intellectual you,
											and often they&#39;re at odds,
											and often they work against you.
											It&#39;s been our experience
that we can win this battle.
											We win it as a group.
											It takes about 18 months typically
											to find that most people
prefer operating this way,
											with this radical transparency
											than to be operating
in a more opaque environment.
											There&#39;s not politics,
there&#39;s not the brutality of —
											you know, all of that hidden,
behind-the-scenes —
											there&#39;s an idea meritocracy
where people can speak up.
											And that&#39;s been great.
											It&#39;s given us more effective work,
											and it&#39;s given us
more effective relationships.
											But it&#39;s not for everybody.
											We found something like
25 or 30 percent of the population
											it&#39;s just not for.
											And by the way,
											when I say radical transparency,
											I&#39;m not saying transparency
about everything.
											I mean, you don&#39;t have to tell somebody
that their bald spot is growing
											or their baby&#39;s ugly.
											So, I&#39;m just talking about —

											So when you leave this room,
											I&#39;d like you to observe yourself
in conversations with others.
											Imagine if you knew
what they were really thinking,
											and imagine if you knew
what they were really like ...
											and imagine if they knew
what you were really thinking
											and what were really like.
											It would certainly clear things up a lot
											and make your operations
together more effective.
											I think it will improve
your relationships.
											Now imagine that you can have algorithms
											that will help you gather
all of that information
											and even help you make decisions
in an idea-meritocratic way.
											This sort of radical transparency
is coming at you
											and it is going to affect your life.
											And in my opinion,
											it&#39;s going to be wonderful.
