											My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher,
											in one of his books, &quot;Philosophical Explanations,&quot;
											is commenting on the ethos of philosophy —
											the way philosophers go about their business.
											And he says, you know, &quot;Philosophers love rational argument.&quot;
											And he says, &quot;It seems as if the ideal argument
											for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises
											and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,
											and if they don&#39;t accept the conclusion, they die.
											Their heads explode.&quot; The idea is to have an argument
											that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.

											It&#39;s very hard to change people&#39;s minds
											about something like consciousness,
											and I finally figured out the reason for that.
											The reason for that is that everybody&#39;s an expert on consciousness.
											We heard the other day that everybody&#39;s got a strong opinion about video games.
											They all have an idea for a video game, even if they&#39;re not experts.
											But they don&#39;t consider themselves experts on video games;
											they&#39;ve just got strong opinions.
											I&#39;m sure that people here who work on, say, climate change
											and global warming, or on the future of the Internet,
											encounter people who have very strong opinions
											about what&#39;s going to happen next.
											But they probably don&#39;t think of these opinions as expertise.
											They&#39;re just strongly held opinions.
											But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,

											Simply by being conscious, I know all about this.&quot;
											And so, you tell them your theory and they say,
											&quot;No, no, that&#39;s not the way consciousness is!

											Now, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble.
											I think everybody understands what that means.
											That&#39;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.
											This is my favorite picture of consciousness that&#39;s ever been done.
											It&#39;s a Saul Steinberg of course — it was a New Yorker cover.
											And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.
											That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,
											Suzanne R. — he&#39;s off to the races.
											There&#39;s a wonderful stream of consciousness here

											Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday:
											what we are, what each of us is — what you are, what I am —
											is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.
											That&#39;s what we&#39;re made of.
											No other ingredients at all. We&#39;re just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.
											Not a single one of those cells is conscious;
											not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.
											Somehow, we have to explain
											how when you put together teams, armies, battalions
											of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells —
											not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them —
											the result is this. I mean, just look at it.
											The content — there&#39;s color, there&#39;s ideas, there&#39;s memories,
											there&#39;s history. And somehow all that content of consciousness
											is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.
											How is that possible? Many people just think it isn&#39;t possible at all.
											They think, &quot;No, there can&#39;t be any
											sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness.&quot;

											Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks.
											If you&#39;re going to explain this as a bag of tricks,
											then it&#39;s not real consciousness, whatever it is.
											And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,
											&quot;Consciousness is a bag of tricks.&quot;
											This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied
											and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.
											So this is the problem. So I have to
											do a little bit of the sort of work
											that a lot of you won&#39;t like,
											for the same reason that you don&#39;t like to see
											a magic trick explained to you.

											Don&#39;t take the thrill of it away. I&#39;d rather be mystified.
											Don&#39;t tell me the answer.&quot;
											A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I&#39;ve discovered.

											But I&#39;m going to try to also show you

											your own consciousness isn&#39;t quite as wonderful —

											Now, let&#39;s see if this will work. All right. Let&#39;s just watch this.

											I&#39;m working with a young computer-animator documentarian
											named Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he&#39;s done for me,
											part of a larger project some of you may be interested in.
											We&#39;re looking for a backer.

											OK, now, you all saw what changed, right?
											How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?
											Every one. I&#39;ll just show you by running it again.
											Even when you know that they&#39;re all going to change color,

											Now, this is an example — one of many —
											of a phenomenon that&#39;s now being studied quite a bit.
											It&#39;s one that I predicted in the last page or two of my
											1991 book, &quot;Consciousness Explained,&quot;
											where I said if you did experiments of this sort,
											you&#39;d find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.
											If there&#39;s time at the end,
											I&#39;ll show you the much more dramatic case.
											Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,
											and that we&#39;re not aware of them?
											Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,
											the way your eye moves around three or four times a second.
											He didn&#39;t mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,
											moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,
											looking at interesting things in the world.
											And where your eye isn&#39;t looking,
											you&#39;re remarkably impoverished in your vision.
											That&#39;s because the foveal part of your eye,
											which is the high-resolution part,
											is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.
											That&#39;s the detail part.
											It doesn&#39;t seem that way, does it?
											It doesn&#39;t seem that way, but that&#39;s the way it is.
											You&#39;re getting in a lot less information than you think.

											Here&#39;s a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto.
											It&#39;s in the museum in North Carolina.
											Bellotto was a student of Canaletto&#39;s.
											And I love paintings like that —
											the painting is actually about as big as it is right here.
											And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,
											and you can get right up
											and see all the details on the painting.
											And I started across the hall in North Carolina,
											because I thought it was probably a Canaletto,
											and would have all that in detail.
											And I noticed that on the bridge there, there&#39;s a lot of people —
											you can just barely see them walking across the bridge.
											And I thought as I got closer
											I would be able to see all the detail of most people,
											see their clothes, and so forth.
											And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.
											I yelled out because when I got closer,
											I found the detail wasn&#39;t there at all.
											There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.
											And as I walked towards the picture,
											I was expecting detail that wasn&#39;t there.
											The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes
											and wagons and all sorts of things,
											and my brain had taken the suggestion.

											Right in the middle of the picture!
											Thanks very much for your attention.
											What I wanted to show you is that scientists,
											using their from-the-outside, third-person methods,
											can tell you things about your own consciousness
											that you would never dream of,
											and that, in fact, you&#39;re not the authority
											on your own consciousness that you think you are.
											And we&#39;re really making a lot of progress
											on coming up with a theory of mind.

											Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt
											to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience.
											And he&#39;s right. This is a problem.
											Harvard Medical School once — I was at a talk —
											director of the lab said, &quot;In our lab, we have a saying.
											If you work on one neuron, that&#39;s neuroscience.
											If you work on two neurons, that&#39;s psychology.&quot;

He is the next Bertrand Russell. Unlike traditional philosophers, Dan is a student of neuroscience, linguistics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and psychology. He's redefining and reforming the role of the philosopher.","whotheyare":"Dan Dennett argues that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes.","whylisten":"<p>One of our most important living philosophers, Dan Dennett is best known for his provocative and controversial arguments that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes in the brain. He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\"

He is the next Bertrand Russell. Unlike traditional philosophers, Dan is a student of neuroscience, linguistics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and psychology. He's redefining and reforming the role of the philosopher.","whotheyare":"Dan Dennett argues that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes.","whylisten":"<p>One of our most important living philosophers, Dan Dennett is best known for his provocative and controversial arguments that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes in the brain. He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</em></a><em>. </em>Read an excerpt from his 2013 book, <a href=\"http://geni.us/intuitionpumps\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Intuition Pumps</em></a>, in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Guardian</em> &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Dan Dennett","tags":["brain","consciousness","culture","entertainment","illusion","self","visualizations"],"title":"The illusion of consciousness","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2928784}]}
