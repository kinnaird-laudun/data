<title>Elizabeth Pisani: Sex, drugs and HIV -- let&#39;s get rational | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Armed with bracing logic, wit and her &quot;public-health nerd&quot; glasses, Elizabeth Pisani reveals the myriad of inconsistencies in today&#39;s political systems that prevent our dollars from effectively fighting the spread of HIV. Her research with at-risk populations -- from junkies in prison to sex workers on the street in Cambodia -- demonstrates the sometimes counter-intuitive measures that could stall the spread of this devastating disease." />

											&quot;People do stupid things.

											for perfectly rational reasons.
											Now, &quot;rational&quot; is the dominant paradigm
											in public health,
											and if you put your public health nerd glasses on,
											you&#39;ll see that if we give people the information that they need
											about what&#39;s good for them and what&#39;s bad for them,
											if you give them the services
											that they can use to act on that information,
											and a little bit of motivation,

											So, let&#39;s start with what&#39;s rational for an addict.
											Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.
											We were having lunch and he was telling me
											about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.
											It was someone&#39;s birthday, and they had very kindly
											smuggled some heroin into jail,
											and he was very generously sharing it out
											with all of his colleagues.
											And so everyone lined up,
											all the smackheads in a row,
											and the guy whose birthday it was
											filled up the fit,
											and he went down and started injecting people.
											So he injects the first guy,
											and then he&#39;s wiping the needle on his shirt,
											and he injects the next guy.
											And Frankie says, &quot;I&#39;m number 22 in line,
											and I can see the needle coming down towards me,
											and there is blood all over the place.
											It&#39;s getting blunter and blunter.
											And a small part of my brain is thinking,
											&#39;That is so gross
											and really dangerous,&#39;
											but most of my brain is thinking,
											&#39;Please let there be some smack left
											by the time it gets to me.
											Please let there be some left.&#39;&quot;
											And then, telling me this story,

											And, you know, you can&#39;t fault him for accuracy.
											But, actually, Frankie, at that time,
											was a heroin addict and he was in jail.
											So his choice was either

									<p>
											But I&#39;m a scientist
											and I don&#39;t like to make data out of anecdotes,
											so let&#39;s look at some data.
											We talked to 600 drug addicts
											in three cities in Indonesia,
											and we said, &quot;Well, do you know how you get HIV?&quot;
											&quot;Oh yeah, by sharing needles.&quot;
											I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.
											And, &quot;Do you know where you can get a clean needle
											at a price you can afford to avoid that?&quot;
											&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; Hundred percent.
											&quot;We&#39;re smackheads; we know where to get clean needles.&quot;
											&quot;So are you carrying a needle?&quot;
											We&#39;re actually interviewing people on the street,
											in the places where they&#39;re hanging out and taking drugs.
											&quot;Are you carrying clean needles?&quot;
											One in four, maximum.
											So no surprises then that
											the proportion that actually used clean needles
											every time they injected in the last week
											is just about one in 10,
											and the other nine in 10 are sharing.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So you&#39;ve got this massive mismatch;
											everyone knows that
											if they share they&#39;re going to get HIV,
											but they&#39;re all sharing anyway.
											So what&#39;s that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?
											We asked that to a junkie and they&#39;re like, &quot;Are you nuts?&quot;
											You don&#39;t want to share a needle anymore than you want
											to share a toothbrush even with someone you&#39;re sleeping with.
											There&#39;s just kind of an ick factor there.
											&quot;No, no. We share needles because we don&#39;t want to go to jail.&quot;
											So, in Indonesia at this time,
											if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up,
											they could put you into jail.
											And that changes the equation slightly, doesn&#39;t it?
											Because your choice now is either
											I use my own needle now,
											or I could share a needle now
											and get a disease that&#39;s going to
											possibly kill me 10 years from now,
											or I could use my own needle now
											and go to jail tomorrow.
											And while junkies think that
											it&#39;s a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,
											they think it&#39;s a much worse idea
											to spend the next year in jail
											where they&#39;ll probably end up in Frankie&#39;s situation
											and expose themselves to HIV anyway.
											So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational
											to share needles.

									<p>
											Now, let&#39;s look at it from a policy maker&#39;s point of view.
											This is a really easy problem.
											For once, your incentives are aligned.
											We&#39;ve got what&#39;s rational for public health.
											You want people to use clean needles —
											and junkies want to use clean needles.
											So we could make this problem go away
											simply by making clean needles universally available
											and taking away the fear of arrest.
											Now, the first person to figure that out
											and do something about it on a national scale
											was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal
											Margaret Thatcher.
											And she put in the world&#39;s first
											national needle exchange program,
											and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.
											And in all of those countries, you can see,
											not more than four percent of injectors
											ever became infected with HIV.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, places that didn&#39;t do this — New York City for example,
											Moscow, Jakarta —
											we&#39;re talking, at its peak,
											one in two injectors
											infected with this fatal disease.
											Now, Margaret Thatcher didn&#39;t do this
											because she has any great love for junkies.
											She did it because she ran a country
											that had a national health service.
											So, if she didn&#39;t invest in effective prevention,
											she was going to have pick up the costs
											of treatment later on,
											and obviously those are much higher.
											So she was making a politically rational decision.
											Now, if I take out my
											public health nerd glasses here
											and look at these data,
											it seems like a no-brainer, doesn&#39;t it?
											But in this country,
											where the government apparently does not feel compelled
											to provide health care for citizens, (Laughter)
											we&#39;ve taken a very different approach.
											So what we&#39;ve been doing in the United States
											is reviewing the data — endlessly reviewing the data.
											So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies
											by all the big muckety-mucks
											of the scientific pantheon in the United States,
											and these are the studies that show
											needle programs are effective — quite a lot of them.
											Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren&#39;t effective —
											you think that&#39;s one of these annoying dynamic slides
											and I&#39;m going to press my dongle and the rest of it&#39;s going to come up,
											but no — that&#39;s the whole slide.

											So, completely irrational,

											Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,
											and they&#39;re responding to what they think the voters want.
											So what we see is that voters respond
											very well to things like this

											Okay, seriously,
											HIV is actually not that easy
											to transmit sexually.
											So, it depends on how much virus there is
											in your blood and in your body fluids.
											And what we&#39;ve got is a very, very high level of virus
											right at the beginning when you&#39;re first infected,
											then you start making antibodies,
											and then it bumps along at quite low levels
											for a long time — 10 or 12 years —
											you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
											But basically, nothing much is going on
											until you start to get symptomatic AIDS,
											and by that stage,
											you&#39;re not looking great, you&#39;re not feeling great,
											you&#39;re not having that much sex.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the sexual transmission of HIV
											is essentially determined by how many partners you have
											in these very short spaces of time
											when you have peak viremia.
											Now, this makes people crazy
											because it means that you have to talk about
											some groups having more sexual partners
											in shorter spaces of time than other groups,
											and that&#39;s considered stigmatizing.
											I&#39;ve always been a bit curious about that
											because I think stigma is a bad thing,
											whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,
											but we&#39;ll leave that be.
											The truth is that 20 years
											of very good research
											have shown us that
											there are groups that are more likely to turnover
											large numbers of partners in a short space of time.
											And those groups are, globally,
											people who sell sex and their more regular partners.
											They are gay men on the party scene
											who have, on average, three times more partners
											than straight people on the party scene.
											And they are heterosexuals
											who come from countries that have
											traditions of polygamy
											and relatively high levels of female autonomy,
											and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.
											And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.

											You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.
											These are all countries in southern Africa
											where between one in seven,
											and one in three
											of all adults,
											are infected with HIV.
											Now, in the rest of the world,
											we&#39;ve got basically nothing going on in the general population —
											very, very low levels —
											but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV
											in these other populations who are at highest risk:
											drug injectors, sex workers
											and gay men.
											And you&#39;ll note, that&#39;s the local data from Los Angeles:
											25 percent prevalence among gay men.
											Of course, you can&#39;t get HIV just by having unprotected sex.
											You can only HIV by having unprotected sex
											with a positive person.

											In most of the world,
											these few prevention failures
											notwithstanding,
											we are actually doing quite well these days
											in commercial sex:
											condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent
											in commercial sex in most countries.
											And, again, it&#39;s because of an alignment of the incentives.
											What&#39;s rational for public health
											is also rational for individual sex workers
											because it&#39;s really bad for business to have another STI.
											No one wants it.
											And, actually, clients don&#39;t want to go home with a drip either.
											So essentially, you&#39;re able to achieve
											quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.

											But in &quot;intimate&quot; relations
											it&#39;s much more difficult because,

											we have this illusion of romance
											and trust and intimacy,
											and nothing is quite so unromantic
											as the, &quot;My condom or yours, darling?&quot; question.
											So in the face of that,
											you really need quite a strong incentive

											This, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.
											He&#39;s from Haiti and he has AIDS.
											And he&#39;s probably not having a lot of sex right now,
											but he is a reminder in the population,
											of why you might want to be
											using condoms.
											This is also in Haiti and is a reminder
											of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.
											Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph
											after six months on antiretroviral treatment.
											Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.
											But it is changing the equation
											of what&#39;s rational
											in sexual decision-making.
											So, what we&#39;ve got —
											some people say, &quot;Oh, it doesn&#39;t matter very much
											because, actually, treatment is effective prevention
											because it lowers your viral load and therefore
											makes it more difficult to transmit HIV.&quot;
											So, if you look at the viremia thing again,
											if you do start treatment when you&#39;re sick,
											well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.
											But compared to what? What happens if you&#39;re not on treatment?
											Well, you die,
											so your viral load goes to zero.
											And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes —
											which are because you couldn&#39;t get to the pharmacy,
											or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge
											and forgot to take your drugs,
											or because you&#39;ve started to get resistance, or whatever —
											all of that is virus

											Now, am I saying, &quot;Oh, well, great prevention strategy.
											Let&#39;s just stop treating people.&quot;
											Of course not, of course not.
											We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.
											But what I am doing is calling into question
											those people who say that more treatment
											is all the prevention we need.
											That&#39;s simply not necessarily true,
											and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men
											in rich countries where treatment has been widely available
											for going on 15 years now.
											And what we&#39;ve seen is
											that, actually, condom use rates,
											which were very, very high —
											the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,
											with extremely little help
											from public health nerds, I would say —
											that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment
											for two reasons really:
											One is the assumption of, &quot;Oh well,
											if he&#39;s infected, he&#39;s probably on meds,
											and his viral load&#39;s going to be low, so I&#39;m pretty safe.&quot;

											And the other thing is that people are simply
											not as scared of HIV
											as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.
											AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,
											and HIV is an invisible virus
											that makes you take a pill every day.
											And that&#39;s boring,
											but is it as boring as
											having to use a condom every time you have sex,
											no matter how drunk you are,
											no matter how many poppers you&#39;ve taken, whatever?
											If we look at the data, we can see that

											So these are data from Scotland.
											You see the peak in drug injectors
											before they started the national needle exchange program.
											Then it came way down.
											And both in heterosexuals — mostly in commercial sex —
											and in drug users,
											you&#39;ve really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,
											and that&#39;s because of that alignment of incentives
											that I talked about earlier.
											But in gay men,
											you&#39;ve got quite a dramatic rise
											starting three or four years

											more likely to be getting laid
											with HIV —
											is outweighing the effects of lower viral load,
											and that&#39;s a very worrisome thing.

											Elizabeth Pisani: &quot;When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.&quot;
											So, from the point of view of a sex worker,
											politicians are making no sense.
											From the point of view of a public health nerd,
											junkies are doing dumb things.
											The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.
											There are as many different ways of being rational
											as there are human beings on the planet,
											and that&#39;s one of the glories of human existence.
											But those ways of being rational
											are not independent of one another,
											so it&#39;s rational for
											a drug injector to share needles
											because of a stupid decision that&#39;s made by a politician,
											and it&#39;s rational for a politician
											to make that stupid decision
											because they&#39;re responding to
											what they think the voters want.
											But here&#39;s the thing:
											we are the voters.
											We&#39;re not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.
											And everyone who&#39;s in this room,
											and everyone who&#39;s watching this out there on the web,
											I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians
											that we make policy based on scientific evidence
											and on common sense.
											It&#39;s going to be really hard for us
											to individually affect what&#39;s rational
											for every Frankie and every Ines out there,
											but you can at least use your vote
											to stop politicians doing stupid things
											that spread HIV.
