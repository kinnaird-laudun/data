									<p>
											In his inaugural address,
											Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best
											as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.
											But what did he appeal to?
											He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,
											and tell us to just go shopping.
											Nor did he tell us, &quot;Trust us. Trust your country.
											Invest, invest, invest.&quot;
											Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.
											And he appealed to virtue.
											Virtue is an old-fashioned word.
											It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.
											And besides, some of you might be wondering,
											what the hell does it mean?
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Let me begin with an example.
											This is the job description of a hospital janitor
											that is scrolling up on the screen.
											And all of the items on it are unremarkable.
											They&#39;re the things you would expect:
											mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.
											It may be a little surprising how many things there are,
											but it&#39;s not surprising what they are.
											But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:
											even though this is a very long list,
											there isn&#39;t a single thing on it that involves other human beings.
											Not one.
											The janitor&#39;s job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors
											to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,
											they encountered Mike,
											who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor
											because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,
											trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.
											And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor&#39;s admonition
											and didn&#39;t vacuum the visitor&#39;s lounge
											because there were some family members who were there all day, every day
											who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.
											And then there was Luke,
											who washed the floor in a comatose young man&#39;s room twice
											because the man&#39;s father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,
											didn&#39;t see Luke do it the first time,
											and his father was angry.
											And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses
											and, if we&#39;re lucky now and then, from doctors,
											doesn&#39;t just make people feel a little better,
											it actually improves the quality of patient care
											and enables hospitals to run well.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.
											But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions
											involving kindness, care and empathy
											are an essential part of the job.
											And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.
											These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.
											And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what &quot;doing right&quot; means.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											&quot;Practical wisdom,&quot; Aristotle told us,
											&quot;is the combination of moral will and moral skill.&quot;
											A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,
											as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.
											A wise person knows how to improvise,
											as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.
											Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined
											and the context is always changing.
											A wise person is like a jazz musician —
											using the notes on the page, but dancing around them,
											inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.
											A wise person knows how to use these moral skills
											in the service of the right aims.
											To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.
											And finally, perhaps most important,
											a wise person is made, not born.
											Wisdom depends on experience,
											and not just any experience.
											You need the time to get to know the people that you&#39;re serving.
											You need permission to be allowed to improvise,
											try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.
											And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.

											When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described

											It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.
											At TED, brilliance is rampant.

											The good news is you don&#39;t need to be brilliant to be wise.
											The bad news is that without wisdom,

											Now, I hope that we all know this.
											There&#39;s a sense in which it&#39;s obvious,
											and yet, let me tell you a little story.
											It&#39;s a story about lemonade.
											A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.
											His son asked him for some lemonade
											and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.
											All they had was Mike&#39;s Hard Lemonade,
											which was five percent alcohol.
											Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike&#39;s Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.
											So he brought it back.
											And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,
											and called the police, who called an ambulance
											that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.
											The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.
											And they were ready to let the kid go.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But not so fast.
											The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.
											And the child was sent to a foster home for three days.
											At that point, can the child go home?
											Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.
											After two weeks, I&#39;m happy to report,
											the family was reunited.
											But the welfare workers and the ambulance people
											and the judge all said the same thing:
											&quot;We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure.&quot;

									<p>
											How do things like this happen?
											Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR,
											said, &quot;Rules and procedures may be dumb,
											but they spare you from thinking.&quot;
											And, to be fair, rules are often imposed
											because previous officials have been lax
											and they let a child go back to an abusive household.
											Fair enough.
											When things go wrong, as of course they do,
											we reach for two tools to try to fix them.

									<p>
											One tool we reach for is rules.
											Better ones, more of them.
											The second tool we reach for is incentives.
											Better ones, more of them.
											What else, after all, is there?
											We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.
											Regulate, regulate, regulate.
											Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...
											The truth is that neither rules nor incentives
											are enough to do the job.
											How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?
											And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?
											It&#39;s preposterous on its face.
											And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,
											rules and incentives may make things better in the short run,
											but they create a downward spiral
											that makes them worse in the long run.
											Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules
											that deprives us of the opportunity
											to improvise and learn from our improvisations.
											And moral will is undermined
											by an incessant appeal to incentives
											that destroy our desire to do the right thing.
											And without intending it,
											by appealing to rules and incentives,
											we are engaging in a war on wisdom.

									<p>
											Let me just give you a few examples,
											first of rules and the war on moral skill.
											The lemonade story is one.
											Second, no doubt more familiar to you,
											is the nature of modern American education:
											scripted, lock-step curricula.
											Here&#39;s an example from Chicago kindergarten.
											Reading and enjoying literature
											and words that begin with &#39;B.&#39;
											&quot;The Bath:&quot; Assemble students on a rug
											and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.
											Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.
											All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,
											every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.
											We know why these scripts are there.
											We don&#39;t trust the judgment of teachers enough
											to let them loose on their own.
											Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.
											And they prevent disaster.
											But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.

											Don&#39;t get me wrong. We need rules!
											Jazz musicians need some notes —

											Now, how about incentives?
											They seem cleverer.
											If you have one reason for doing something
											and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,
											it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one
											and you&#39;re more likely to do it.
											Right?
											Well, not always.
											Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another

											I&#39;ll just give you one example because time is racing.
											In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,
											they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.
											There was going to be a national referendum.
											Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.
											And they said, &quot;Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?&quot;
											Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.
											They knew it was dangerous.
											They thought it would reduce their property values.
											But it had to go somewhere
											and they had responsibilities as citizens.
											The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.
											They said, &quot;If we paid you six weeks&#39; salary every year
											would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?&quot;
											Two reasons. It&#39;s my responsibility and I&#39;m getting paid.
											Instead of 50 percent saying yes,
											25 percent said yes.
											What happens is that
											the second this introduction of incentive gets us
											so that instead of asking, &quot;What is my responsibility?&quot;
											all we ask is, &quot;What serves my interests?&quot;
											When incentives don&#39;t work,
											when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies
											in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,
											the response is always the same.
											Get smarter incentives.

											The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise

											Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.
											We need incentives. People have to make a living.

											Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,
											&quot;We must ask not just &#39;Is it profitable?&#39; but &#39;Is it right?&#39;&quot;
											And when professions are demoralized,
											everyone in them becomes dependent on — addicted to — incentives

											We see this in medicine.
											(&quot;Although it&#39;s nothing serious, let&#39;s keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn&#39;t turn into a major lawsuit.&quot;)

											The factory burned down.
											3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.
											Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them

											Two were particularly inspiring to me.
											One was Ray Anderson, who turned —
											(Applause)
											— turned, you know, a part of the evil empire
											into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.
											Why? Because it was the right thing to do.
											And a bonus he&#39;s discovering is
											he&#39;s actually going to make even more money.
											His employees are inspired by the effort.
											Why? Because there happy to be doing something that&#39;s the right thing to do.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In many ways this is the perfect example.
											Because it took the will to do the right thing.
											God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.
											I&#39;m boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know
											in order to plot this out.
											But most important to make it work —
											and he emphasized this —
											is that it took knowing the people in the communities.
											Unless the people you&#39;re working with are behind you,
											this will fail.
											And there isn&#39;t a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,
											because different people in different communities
											organize their lives in different ways.

											So there&#39;s a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.
											And you don&#39;t have to be a mega-hero.
											There are ordinary heroes.
											Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.
											As practitioners each and every one of us should strive
											to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.
											As heads of organizations,
											we should strive to create environments
											that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.
											Even the wisest and most well-meaning people

											And, perhaps most important,
											as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,

											And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.
											One is that we are always teaching.
											Someone is always watching.
											The camera is always on.
											Bill Gates talked about the importance of education
											and, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing
											that Bill didn&#39;t mention.
											That is that they have come to the realization
											that the single most important thing kids need to learn
											is character.
											They need to learn to respect themselves.
											They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.
											They need to learn to respect their teachers.
											And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.
											That&#39;s the principle objective.
											If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.
											And the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids
											is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.

His relatable examples, from consumer products (jeans, TVs, salad dressings) to lifestyle choices (where to live, what job to take, who and when to marry), underscore this central point: Too much choice undermines happiness.<br /><br />Schwartz&#39;s previous research has addressed morality, decision-making and the varied inter-relationships between science and society. Before <em>Paradox</em> he published <a href=\"http://geni.us/costofliving\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Costs of Living</em></a>, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and <strong>the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law</strong>.<br /><br />Both books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time.

freeing us.","whotheyare":"Barry Schwartz studies the link between economics and psychology, offering startling insights into modern life. Lately, working with Ken Sharpe, he's studying wisdom.","whylisten":"<p>In his 2004 book <a href=\"http://geni.us/paradoxofchoice\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Paradox of Choice</em></a>, Barry Schwartz tackles one of the great mysteries of modern life: Why is it that societies of great abundance &mdash; where individuals are offered more freedom and choice (personal, professional, material) than ever before &mdash; are now witnessing a near-epidemic of depression? <strong>Conventional wisdom tells us that greater choice is for the greater good, but Schwartz argues the opposite</strong>: He makes a compelling case that the abundance of choice in today&#39;s western world is actually making us miserable. <br /><br /><strong>Infinite choice is paralyzing, Schwartz argues, and exhausting to the human psyche. </strong>It leads us to set unreasonably high expectations, question our choices before we even make them and blame our failures entirely on ourselves. His relatable examples, from consumer products (jeans, TVs, salad dressings) to lifestyle choices (where to live, what job to take, who and when to marry), underscore this central point: Too much choice undermines happiness.<br /><br />Schwartz&#39;s previous research has addressed morality, decision-making and the varied inter-relationships between science and society. Before <em>Paradox</em> he published <a href=\"http://geni.us/costofliving\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Costs of Living</em></a>, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and <strong>the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law</strong>.<br /><br />Both books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time. But they also offer <strong>concrete ideas on addressing the problems</strong>, from a personal and societal level.</p><p>Schwartz is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/whyweworkintl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why We Work</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Barry Schwartz","tags":["business","culture","global issues","philosophy","self","social change","society","psychology"],"title":"Our loss of wisdom","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":3512577}]}
