											Chris Anderson: Thank you
so much, Prime Minister,
											that was both fascinating
and quite inspiring.
											So, you&#39;re calling for a global ethic.
											Would you describe that
as global citizenship?
											Is that an idea that you believe in,
and how would you define that?

											Gordon Brown: It is
about global citizenship
											and recognizing
our responsibilities to others.
											There is so much to do
over the next few years
											that is obvious to so many of us
											to build a better world.
											And there is so much shared sense
of what we need to do,
											that it is vital
that we all come together.
											But we don&#39;t necessarily have
the means to do so.

									<p>
											So there are challenges to be met.
											I believe the concept
of global citizenship
											will simply grow out of people talking
to each other across continents.
											But of course the task
is to create the institutions
											that make that global society work.
											But I don&#39;t think we should underestimate
											the extent to which
massive changes in technology
											make possible the linking up
of people across the world.

											CA: But people get excited
about this idea of global citizenship,
											but then they get confused a bit again
											when they start thinking about patriotism,
											and how to combine these two.
											I mean, you&#39;re elected as Prime Minister
											with a brief to bat for Britain.
											How do you reconcile the two things?

											GB: Well, of course national identity
remains important.
											But it&#39;s not at the expense of people
accepting their global responsibilities.
											And I think one
of the problems of recession
											is that people become more protectionist,
											they look in on themselves,
											they try to protect their own nation,
											perhaps at the expense of other nations.
											When you actually look
at the motor of the world economy,
											it cannot move forward
											unless there is trade
between the different countries.
											And any nation that would become
protectionist over the next few years
											would deprive itself of the chance
of getting the benefits
											of growth in the world economy.

											So, you&#39;ve got to have

											There is a great story, again,
told about Richard Nixon.
											1958, Ghana becomes independent,

											Richard Nixon goes to represent
the United States government
											at the celebrations
for independence in Ghana.
											And it&#39;s one of his first outings
as Vice President to an African country.
											He doesn&#39;t quite know what to do,
											so he starts going around the crowd
											and starts talking to people
											and he says to people
in this rather unique way,
											&quot;How does it feel to be free?&quot;
											And he&#39;s going around,

											But what is equally remarkable

have not moved forward very fast

											And yet, America and Africa
have got a common interest.
											And we have got to realize
that if we don&#39;t link up
											with those people who are sensible voices
and democratic voices in Africa,
											to work together for common causes,
											then the danger of Al Qaeda
and related groups

the life of one American soldier

											I&#39;m just wondering whether

											After the Second World War,

											the IMF, the World Bank,

the Marshall Plan.
											There was a period in which people
talked about an act of creation,

at the biggest challenge we face,

											So, I come back to my initial point.
											Sometimes you think things are impossible.
											Nobody would have said 50 years ago
											that apartheid would have gone in 1990,
											or that the Berlin wall would have fallen
at the turn of the &#39;80s and &#39;90s,

a man could gone to the Moon.
											All these things have happened.
