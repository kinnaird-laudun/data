<title>Isabel Wilkerson: The Great Migration and the power of a single decision | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Sometimes, a single decision can change the course of history. Join journalist and author Isabel Wilkerson as she tells the story of the Great Migration, the outpouring of six million African Americans from the Jim Crow South to cities in the North and West between World War I and the 1970s. This was the first time in American history that the lowest caste people signaled they had options and were willing to take them -- and the first time they had a chance to choose for themselves what they would do with their innate talents, Wilkerson explains. &quot;These people, by their actions, were able to do what the powers that be, North and South, could not or would not do,&quot; she says. &quot;They freed themselves.&quot;" />

<meta content='Sometimes, a single decision can change the course of history. Join journalist and author Isabel Wilkerson as she tells the story of the Great Migration, the outpouring of six million African Americans from the Jim Crow South to cities in the North and West between World War I and the 1970s. This was the first time in American history that the lowest caste people signaled they had options and were willing to take them — and the first time they had a chance to choose for themselves what they would do with their innate talents, Wilkerson explains. "These people, by their actions, were able to do what the powers that be, North and South, could not or would not do," she says. "They freed themselves."' itemprop='description'>

											Imagine with me this scene.
											It&#39;s a scene that played out
in nearly all of our families.
											It&#39;s a scene in which a young person,
											somewhere in our family tree,
											somewhere in our lineage
											had a heartbreaking decision to make.
											It was a decision to leave all
that they had known.
											And all of the people that they had loved
											and to set out for a place far, far away
											that they had never seen

											Migration is usually
a young person&#39;s endeavor.
											It&#39;s the kind of thing that you do
when you&#39;re on the cusp of life.
											And so, there is, in all of our families,
											this young person
somewhere in our background.
											That person is standing at a dock,
											about to board a ship
											that will cross the Atlantic
or the Pacific Ocean.
											That person is loading up a truck
											that will cross the Rio Grande.
											Or that person is standing

											One of these migration streams
											stands out in ways
that we may not realize.
											It was called the Great Migration.
											It was the outpouring
of six million African Americans
											from the Jim Crow South
											to the cities of the North and West,
											from the time of World War I
until the 1970s.
											It stands out because this
was the first time in American history
											that American citizens
had to flee the land of their birth
											just to be recognized as the citizens
that they had always been.
											No other group of Americans
											has had to act like immigrants
											in order to be recognized as citizens.

											So this great migration was not a move.
											It was actually a seeking
of political asylum
											within the borders of one&#39;s own country.
											They were defecting a caste system
known as Jim Crow.
											It was an artificial hierarchy
											in which everything
that you could and could not do
											was based upon what you looked like.
											This caste system was so arcane
that it was actually against the law
											for a black person and a white person
											to merely play checkers
together in Birmingham.
											You could go to jail
											if you were caught playing checkers
with a person of a different race.
											Someone must have seen
a black person and a white person
											playing checkers with someone
in some town square.
											And maybe the wrong person was winning
											or they were having too good of a time,
											but whatever it was that this person saw,
											with this black person
and this white person playing checkers,
											they felt the entire foundation
of Southern civilization was in peril.
											And decided that it was worth
taking the time
											to write this down as a law.

											This caste system was so arcane
											that in courtrooms throughout the South
there was actually a black Bible
											and an altogether separate white Bible
											to swear to tell the truth on in court.
											The very word of God was segregated
											in the caste system of the Jim Crow South.
											The same sacred object
											could not be touched
by hands of different races.

											This artificial hierarchy,
											because it goes against
human desires to be free,
											required a tremendous amount
of violence to maintain.
											Such that every four days,
somewhere in the American South,
											every four days
an African American was lynched
											for some perceived breach of protocol
in this caste system
											in the decades leading up
to the start of the Great Migration.
											This caste system had been put in place
for many, many reasons.
											But one of them was to maintain
the economic order of the South,
											which required not just
a supply of cheap labor
											but an oversupply of cheap labor
to work at the will of the land.

											This Great Migration began
when the North had a labor problem.
											The North had a labor problem
											because it had been relying
on cheap labor from Europe —
											immigrants from Europe —
											to work the factories and the foundries
and the steel mills.
											But during World War I,
											migration from Europe
came to a virtual halt.
											And so the North had a labor problem.
											And so the North decided to go
and find the cheapest labor in the land
											which meant African Americans
in the South,
											many of whom were not even being paid
for their hard work.
											Many of them were working
											for the right to live on the land
that they were farming.
											They were sharecroppers
and not even being paid.
											So they were ripe for recruitment.

									<p>
											But it turned out
											that the South did not take kindly
to this poaching of its cheap labor.
											The South actually did everything it could
to keep the people from leaving.
											They would arrest people
from the railroad platforms.
											Remember, putatively free
American citizens.
											They would arrest them
from their train seats.
											And when there were too many
people to arrest,
											they would wave the train on through
											so that people who had been hoping
											and saving
											and praying for the chance
to get to freedom
											had to figure out:
How now will we get out?
											And as they made their way
out of the South,
											away from Jim Crow,
											they followed three
beautifully predictable streams
											as is the case in any migration
throughout human history.

											In this particular case,
there were three streams.
											One was the migration along the East Coast
											from Florida, Georgia,
the Carolinas and Virginia
											to Washington DC, to Philadelphia,
											New Jersey, New York
and on up the East coast.
											There was the Midwest stream,
											which carried people
from Mississippi, Alabama,
											Tennessee and Arkansas
											to Chicago, to Detroit,
to Cleveland and the entire Midwest.
											And then there was the West Coast stream,
											which carried people
from Louisiana and Texas
											out to California.
											And when they really wanted to get away,
											they went to Seattle.
											And when they really, really
wanted to get away,
											they went to Alaska,
											the farthest possible point
within the borders of the United States
											from Jim Crow South.

											Before the Great Migration began,
											90 percent of all African Americans
were living in the South.
											Nearly held captive in the South.
											But by the time
this Great Migration was over,
											nearly half were living
all over the rest of the country.
											So this ended up being
nearly a complete redistribution
											of part of an entire people.

											This Great Migration was the first time
in American history

											signaled that they had options
and were willing to take them.
											That had not happened
in the three centuries
											in which African Americans
had been on that soil at that time.
											It had not happened
in 12 generations of enslavement
											that preceded
nearly a century of Jim Crow.
											How many &quot;greats&quot;

a Toni Morrison as we now know her to be.
											Her parents were from Alabama

would get to do something

and against protocol for African Americans
											at the time that she would have been
growing up in the South,

											And that is just to walk into a library
											and take out a library book.
											Merely by making
the single decision to leave,
											her parents assured that their daughter
would get access to books.

											Music as we know it was reshaped
by the Great Migration.

they brought with them,

											the music that had sustained
the ancestors —
											the blues music, the spirituals
and the gospel music
											that had sustained them
through the generations.
											And they converted this music
into whole new genres of music.
											And got the chance to record this music,

											Without the Great Migration,
&quot;Motown&quot; would not have existed.
											The founder, Berry Gordy,
his parents were from Georgia.
											They migrated to Detroit.
											And when he got to be a grown man,
he decided he wanted to go into music.
											But he didn&#39;t have the wherewithal
to go all over the country
											looking for the best talent,
											and it turned out he didn&#39;t have to.
											It turned out that there he was,
											surrounded by children
of the Great Migration
											whose parents had brought this music up
with them during the journey.
											And among those children
were these three girls,
											there was Mary Wilson,
											Florence Ballard
											and there was a third one:
											Diana Ross.
											We might not know Diana Ross&#39; name
had there been no Great Migration.
											Because like a lot of Americans
and a lot of human beings in general,
											she might not have existed
because her parents might not have met.
											Her mother was from Alabama,
											father from West Virginia,
											they migrated to Detroit, different years,
											met, married, had her and her siblings,

											Jazz was a creation
of the Great Migration.

of the Great Migration.
											Starting with Louis Armstrong,
who was born in Louisiana
											and migrated on the Illinois
Central Railroad to Chicago,
											where he got the chance
to build on the talent
											that was within him all along.
											Miles Davis.
											His parents were from Arkansas.
											They migrated to southern Illinois,
											where he would get the chance
to build on the talents
											that were within him all along
											but which could have gone fallow
in the cotton country of Arkansas.
											John Coltrane.
											He migrated at the age of 16
											from North Carolina to Philadelphia,
											where, upon arrival in Philadelphia,
he got his first alto sax.
											And there are lovers of jazz
who cannot imagine a world
											without John Coltrane
having gotten a hold of a saxophone.
											Thelonious Monk.
											Michael Jackson.
											Jesse Owens.
											Prince.
