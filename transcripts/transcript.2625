											I am an American civil rights activist

of color since September 11,
											fighting unjust policies by the state
and acts of hate in the street.

hate in America has been a study

											Revolutionary love
is the choice to enter into labor
											for others who do not look like us,
											for our opponents who hurt us
											and for ourselves.
											In this era of enormous rage,
											when the fires are burning all around us,

											My first encounter with hate
was in the schoolyard.
											I was a little girl
growing up in California,
											where my family has lived
and farmed for a century.
											When I was told that I would go to hell
because I was not Christian,
											called a &quot;black dog&quot;
because I was not white,
											I ran to my grandfather&#39;s arms.
											Papa Ji dried my tears —
											gave me the words of Guru Nanak,
											the founder of the Sikh faith.
											&quot;I see no stranger,&quot; said Nanak.
											&quot;I see no enemy.&quot;
											My grandfather taught me
											that I could choose
to see all the faces I meet
											and wonder about them.
											And if I wonder about them,
											then I will listen to their stories
even when it&#39;s hard.
											I will refuse to hate them
even when they hate me.
											I will even vow to protect them
when they are in harm&#39;s way.
											That&#39;s what it means to be a Sikh:
											S-i-k-h.
											To walk the path of a warrior saint.
											He told me the story
of the first Sikh woman warrior,
											Mai Bhago.
											The story goes there were 40 soldiers
who abandoned their post
											during a great battle against an empire.
											They returned to a village,
											and this village woman
turned to them and said,
											&quot;You will not abandon the fight.
											You will return to the fire,
											and I will lead you.&quot;
											She mounted a horse.
											She donned a turban.
											And with sword in her hand
and fire in her eyes,
											she led them where no one else would.
											She became the one she was waiting for.
											&quot;Don&#39;t abandon your posts, my dear.&quot;
											My grandfather saw me as a warrior.
											I was a little girl in two long braids,
											but I promised.

											Fast-forward, I&#39;m 20 years old,
											watching the Twin Towers fall,
											the horror stuck in my throat,
											and then a face flashes on the screen:
											a brown man with a turban and beard,
											and I realize that our nation&#39;s new enemy
looks like my grandfather.
											And these turbans meant to represent
our commitment to serve
											cast us as terrorists.
											And Sikhs became targets of hate,
											alongside our Muslim brothers and sisters.
											The first person killed in a hate crime
after September 11 was a Sikh man,
											standing in front
of his gas station in Arizona.
											Balbir Singh Sodhi
was a family friend I called &quot;uncle,&quot;
											murdered by a man
who called himself &quot;patriot.&quot;
											He is the first of many
to have been killed,
											but his story —
											our stories barely made the evening news.
											I didn&#39;t know what to do,
											but I had a camera,
											I faced the fire.
											I went to his widow,
											Joginder Kaur.
											I wept with her, and I asked her,
											&quot;What would you like to tell
the people of America?&quot;
											I was expecting blame.
											But she looked at me and said,
											&quot;Tell them, &#39;Thank you.&#39;
											3,000 Americans came
to my husband&#39;s memorial.
											They did not know me,
											but they wept with me.
											Tell them, &#39;Thank you.&#39;&quot;
											Thousands of people showed up,
											because unlike national news,
											the local media told Balbir Uncle&#39;s story.
											Stories can create the wonder
											that turns strangers
into sisters and brothers.

											This was my second lesson
in revolutionary love.
											We love our opponents
when we tend the wound in them.
											Tending to the wound
is not healing them —
											only they can do that.
											Just tending to it allows us
											to see our opponents:
											the terrorist, the fanatic, the demagogue.
											They&#39;ve been radicalized by cultures
and policies that we together can change.
											I looked back on all of our campaigns,
											and I realized that any time
we fought bad actors,
											we didn&#39;t change very much.
											But when we chose
to wield our swords and shields
											to battle bad systems,
											that&#39;s when we saw change.
											I have worked on campaigns
											that released hundreds of people
out of solitary confinement,
											reformed a corrupt police department,
											changed federal hate crimes policy.
											The choice to love our opponents
is moral and pragmatic,
											and it opens up the previously
unimaginable possibility
											of reconciliation.

											But remember ...
											it took 15 years to make that phone call.
											I had to tend to my own rage

											Loving our opponents
requires us to love ourselves.
											Gandhi, King, Mandela —
											they taught a lot about
how to love others and opponents.
											They didn&#39;t talk a lot
about loving ourselves.

											Because for too long have women
and women of color been told
											to suppress their rage,
											suppress their grief

											But when we suppress our rage,
											that&#39;s when it hardens
into hate directed outward,
											but usually directed inward.
											But mothering has taught me
that all of our emotions are necessary.
											Joy is the gift of love.
											Grief is the price of love.
											Anger is the force that protects it.

											&quot;Brother,
											sister,

											And when we say this,
what we are saying is,

											How are you breathing each day?

											And we dance.
											In the darkness, we breathe and we dance.
