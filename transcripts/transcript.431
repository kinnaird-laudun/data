											So the first question is, why do we need to
											even worry about a pandemic threat?
											What is it that we&#39;re concerned about?
											When I say &quot;we,&quot; I&#39;m at the Council on Foreign Relations.
											We&#39;re concerned in the national security community,
											and of course in the biology community and the public health community.
											While globalization has increased travel,
											it&#39;s made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,
											all the time, all over the world.
											And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.
											So a plague outbreak in Surat, India
											becomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event —
											a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.
											Katrina showed us
											that we cannot completely depend on government
											to have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.
											Indeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu —
											some of you call it bird flu —
											which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,
											but we didn&#39;t know about it until 1997.
											At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.
											But we&#39;re now up to 55 countries in the world,
											have had this virus emerge,
											in either birds, or people or both.
											In the bird outbreaks we now can see
											that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus
											except the Americas.
											And I&#39;ll get into why we&#39;ve so far been spared in a moment.

									<p>
											In domestic birds, especially chickens,
											it&#39;s 100 percent lethal.
											It&#39;s one of the most lethal things we&#39;ve seen
											in circulation in the world
											in any recent centuries.
											And we&#39;ve dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,
											and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers
											with the result that there&#39;s cover-up.
											It&#39;s also carried on migration patterns
											of wild migratory aquatic birds.
											There has been this centralized event
											in a place called Lake Chenghai, China.
											Two years ago the migrating birds
											had a multiple event
											where thousands died because of a mutation occurring
											in the virus,
											which made the species range broaden dramatically.
											So that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa
											carried the virus, which had not previously been possible.

											We&#39;re now seeing outbreaks in human populations —
											so far, fortunately, small events,
											tiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.
											The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years
											to form two distinct families, if you will,
											of the H5N1 viral tree
											with branches in them,
											and with different attributes that are worrying.
											So what&#39;s concerning us? Well, first of all,
											at no time in history have we succeeded in making
											in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine
											for more than 260 million people.
											It&#39;s not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.
											You&#39;ve heard about the vaccine we&#39;re stockpiling.
											But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective
											if we have a real outbreak.

											So one thought is:
											after 9/11, when the airports closed,
											our flu season was delayed by two weeks.
											So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just
											immediately — we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,
											the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter —
											let&#39;s shut down the airports.
											However, huge supercomputer analyses,
											done of the likely effectiveness of this,
											show that it won&#39;t buy us much time at all.
											And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.
											For example, all masks are made in China.
											How do you get them mobilized around the world
											if you&#39;ve shut all the airports down?
											How do you get the vaccines moved around the world
											and the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.
											So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.

											We&#39;re worried because this virus, unlike any other flu
											we&#39;ve ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat
											of the infected animals.
											We&#39;ve seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,
											and now also domestic pet dogs.
											And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,
											we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:
											seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.
											This is not your normal garden-variety flu.
											It mimics what we now understand
											about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,
											the last great pandemic,
											in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.
											We had evolution over time,
											and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:
											55 percent of people who have become infected
											with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.
											And we don&#39;t have a huge number of people
											who got infected and never developed disease.

											In experimental feeding in monkeys
											you can see that it actually downregulates
											a specific immune system modulator.
											The result is that what kills you
											is not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,
											&quot;Whatever this is so foreign I&#39;m going berserk.&quot;
											The result: most of the deaths
											have been in people under 30 years of age,

											We have seen human-to-human transmission

											still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.

											Alright, so I&#39;ve got you nervous.
											Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.
											And we have spent a lot of money.
											Most of the spending in the Bush administration
											has actually been more related to the anthrax results
											and bio-terrorism threat.
											But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level
											to look at infectious diseases.
											End result: only 15 states
											have been certified to be able to do mass distribution
											of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.
											Half the states would run out of hospital beds
											in the first week, maybe two weeks.
											And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.
											Add on pandemic threat, you&#39;re in big trouble.

											So what have people been doing with this money?
											Exercises, drills, all over the world.
											Let&#39;s pretend there&#39;s a pandemic.

											Main result is that there is tremendous confusion.
											Most of these people don&#39;t actually know what their job will be.
											And the bottom line, major thing that has come through

											Nobody knows the chain of command.
											If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,

											The government says
											the federal responsibility will basically be
											about trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible,
											and then to mitigate the impact
											primarily on our economy.
											The rest is up to your local community.
											Everything is about your town, where you live.
											Well how good a city council you have,
											how good a mayor you have — that&#39;s who&#39;s going to be in charge.
											Most local facilities would all be competing
											to try and get their hands on their piece
											of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,

											We don&#39;t know how important hand washing is for flu —
											shocking. One assumes it&#39;s a good idea to wash your hands a lot.
											But actually in scientific community there is great debate
											about what percentage of flu transmission between people
											is from sneezing and coughing
											and what percentage is on your hands.
											The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.
											Can we figure out a way, since we know we won&#39;t have enough masks
											because we don&#39;t make them in America anymore,
											they&#39;re all made in China —
											do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,
											must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?
											Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?
											In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong
											that most of transmission was because
											people were removing their masks improperly.
											And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,
											and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.
											It wasn&#39;t flying microbes.
											If you go online right now, you&#39;ll get so much phony-baloney information.
											You&#39;ll end up buying — this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.
											We don&#39;t actually have a standard

											And Tamiflu. You&#39;ve probably heard of this drug,
											made by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.
											There is some indication
											that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.
											Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time,
											well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.
											A public health survey analyzed the effect
											that large-scale Tamiflu use would have,
											actually shows it counteractive
											to public health measures, making matters worse.
											And here is the other interesting thing:
											when a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent
											is metabolized appropriately
											to be an active compound in the human being.
											The rest turns into a stable compound,
											which survives filtration into the water systems,
											thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu
											and providing them a chance
											to breed resistant strains.
											And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains
											in both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,
											and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.
											So I personally think that our life expectancy
											for Tamiflu as an effective drug
											is very limited — very limited indeed.

											Nevertheless most of the governments

											Russia has actually stockpiled enough
											for 95 percent of all Russians.
											We&#39;ve stockpiled enough for 30 percent.
											When I say enough, that&#39;s two weeks worth.
											And then you&#39;re on your own because
											the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.
											Some of the poorer countries
											that have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;
											they&#39;re already expired. They are already out of date.
											What do we know from 1918,
											the last great pandemic?
											The federal government abdicated most responsibility.
											And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations
											all over America.
											Every city, county, state did their own thing.
											And the rules
											and the belief systems were wildly disparate.
											In some cases all schools, all churches,

											The pandemic circulated three times in 18 months
											in the absence of commercial air travel.
											The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.
											And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.
											But by the time the second wave hit
											it took such a toll among the healthcare workers
											that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.
											Overall we lost 700,000 people.
											The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women
											and we don&#39;t actually know why.
											Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds —
											robustly healthy young adults.
											It was likened to the plague.
											We don&#39;t actually know how many people died.
											The low-ball estimate is 35 million.

											A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard
											shows that if you look at the databases that were kept

											So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty
											the death toll was far higher.
											And that a more likely toll
											is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people
											before we had commercial air travel.
											So are we ready?
											As a nation, no we&#39;re not.
											And I think even those in the leadership

											So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is,

											unless you&#39;ve really done your homework.
											What mask works, what mask doesn&#39;t work.

											We don&#39;t know — again with Tamiflu,
											the number one side effect of Tamiflu is
											flu-like symptoms.
											So then how can you tell

											if everybody is taking Tamiflu?
											If you expand that out to think of a whole community,
											or all your employees in your company,
											you begin to realize how limited
											the Tamiflu option might be.
											Everybody has come up to me and said,
											well I&#39;ll stockpile water or, I&#39;ll stockpile food, or what have you.
											But really? Do you really have a place
											to stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?
											Do you want to view the pandemic threat
											the way back in the 1950s
											people viewed the civil defense issue,
											and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?

											I think it&#39;s about having to be prepared
											as communities, not as individuals —
											being prepared as nation,
											being prepared as state, being prepared as town.
											And right now most of the preparedness
											is deeply flawed.
											And I hope I&#39;ve convinced you of that,
											which means that the real job is go out and
											say to your local leaders,
											and your national leaders,
											&quot;Why haven&#39;t you solved these problems?
											Why are you still thinking that
											the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?&quot;
											And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.
											But I guess the other thing to add is,
											if you do have employees, and you do have a company,
											I think you have certain responsibilities
											to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them,
											and you are trying to plan.
											At a minimum the British banking plan showed that
											telecommuting can be helpful.
											It probably does reduce exposure
											because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other,
											or touching common objects
											and sharing things via their hands.
											But can you sustain your company that way?
											Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.

											And that most people who die of regular flu —
											which in regular flu years
											is about 360,000 people worldwide,

											and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.

											But it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.

											And I would just add
											we saw the same thing with SARS.
											So what&#39;s going on here is your body says,
											your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says,
											&quot;I don&#39;t know what the heck this is.
											We&#39;ve never seen anything even remotely like this before.&quot;
											It won&#39;t do any good to bring in the sharpshooters
											because those antibodies aren&#39;t here.
											And it won&#39;t do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery
											because those T-cells don&#39;t recognize it either.
											So we&#39;re going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response,
											stimulate the total cytokine cascade.
											The whole immune system swarms into the lungs.
											And yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.
											But it&#39;s not bacterial pneumonia.
											And it&#39;s not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.
											And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.
