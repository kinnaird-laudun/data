											The world&#39;s largest and most devastating
environmental and industrial project

and most intact forest in the world,
											Canada&#39;s boreal forest.
											It stretches right across
Northern Canada, in Labrador,
											it&#39;s home to the largest remaining
wild caribou herd in the world:
											the George River caribou herd,
											numbering approximately 400,000 animals.
											Unfortunately, when I was there,
I couldn&#39;t find one of them,

											All across the boreal,
											we&#39;re blessed with this incredible
abundance of wetlands.
											Wetlands, globally, are one
of the most endangered ecosystems.
											They&#39;re absolutely critical ecosystems,
											they clean air, they clean water,
											they sequester large amounts
of greenhouse gases,
											and they&#39;re home
to a huge diversity of species.
											In the boreal, they are also the home
											where almost 50 percent of the 800 bird
species found in North America
											migrate north to breed
and raise their young.

famous art in Canadian history,

											the Peace, the Athabasca,
the Churchill here, the Mackenzie,

retained a link to the past,

											the songs, the dances, the traditions,
											I think part of that reason
is because of the remoteness,
											the span and the wilderness

											This is the Alberta tar sands,

											Trapped underneath the boreal forest

											it is the largest truck
of its kind on the planet.
											It is a 400-ton-capacity dump truck
											and its dimensions are 45 feet long
by 35 feet wide and 25 feet high.
											If I stand beside that truck,
											my head comes to around the bottom
of the yellow part of that hubcap.
											Within the dimensions of that truck,
											you could build a 3,000-square-foot
two-story home quite easily.
											I did the math.
											So instead of thinking of that as a truck,
think of that as a 3,000-square-foot home.
											That&#39;s not a bad size home.
											And line those trucks / homes
back and forth
											across there from the bottom
all the way to the top.
											And then think of how large
that very small section of one mine is.

											Now, you can apply that same kind
of thinking here as well.
											Now, here you see —
of course, as you go further on,
											these trucks become like a pixel.
											Again, imagine those
all back and forth there.
											How large is that one portion of a mine?
											That would be a huge,
vast metropolitan area,
											probably much larger
than the city of Victoria.
											And this is just one of a number of mines,
											10 mines so far right now.
											This is one section of one mining complex,
											and there are about another 40 or 50
in the approval process.
											No tar sands mine has actually
ever been denied approval,
											so it is essentially a rubber stamp.

											The other method of extraction
is what&#39;s called the in situ.
											And here, massive amounts of water
											are superheated and pumped
through the ground,
											through these vasts networks of pipelines,
											seismic lines, drill paths,
compressor stations.
											And even though this looks
maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,
											it&#39;s even more damaging in some ways.
											It impacts and fragments
a larger part of the wilderness,
											where there is 90 percent
reduction of key species,
											like woodland caribou and grizzly bears,
											and it consumes
even more energy, more water,
											and produces at least
as much greenhouse gas.
											So these in situ developments are at least
as ecologically damaging as the mines.

											The oil produced from either method
											produces more greenhouse gas
emissions than any other oil.
											This is one of the reasons
why it&#39;s called the world&#39;s dirtiest oil.
											It&#39;s also one of the reasons
											why it is the largest and fastest-growing
single source of carbon in Canada,
											and it is also a reason
why Canada is now number three
											in terms of producing carbon per person.
											The tailings ponds are the largest toxic
impoundments on the planet.
											Oil sands — or rather,
I should say tar sands —
											oil sands is a PR-created term
											so that the oil companies
wouldn&#39;t be trying to promote something
											that sounds like a sticky tar-like
substance that&#39;s the world&#39;s dirtiest oil.
											So they decided to call it oil sands.
											The tar sands consume more water
than any other oil process,
											three to five barrels of water
are taken, polluted
											and then returned into tailings ponds,
											the largest toxic
impoundments on the planet.

											SemCrude, just one of the licensees,
in just one of their tailings ponds,
											dumps 250,000 tons
of this toxic gunk every single day.
											That&#39;s creating the largest toxic
impoundments in the history of the planet.
											So far, this is enough toxin to cover
the face of Lake Erie a foot deep.
											And the tailings ponds
range in size up to 9,000 acres.
											That&#39;s two-thirds the size
of the entire island of Manhattan.
											That&#39;s like from Wall Street
at the southern edge of Manhattan
											up to maybe 120th Street.
											So this is one of the larger
tailings ponds.
											This might be, what? I don&#39;t know,
half the size of Manhattan.

many ponds from outer space

we should stop calling them ponds —
											these massive toxic wastelands are built
											unlined and on the banks
of the Athabasca River.
											And the Athabasca River drains downstream
to a range of aboriginal communities.
											In Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there,
are finding toxins in the food chain,

I was lent a boat by a First Nations man,

											The boreal forest
is also perhaps our best defense

											The boreal forest sequesters more carbon
than any other terrestrial ecosystem.
											And this is absolutely key.

greenhouse gas sink —
											twice as much greenhouse
gases are sequestered
											in the boreal per acre
than the tropical rainforests.
											And what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re destroying
