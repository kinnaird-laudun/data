<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Contraception. The topic has become controversial in recent years. But should it be? Melinda Gates believes that many of the world&#39;s social change issues depend on ensuring that women are able to control their rate of having kids. In this significant talk at TEDxChange, she makes the case for the world to re-examine an issue she intends to lend her voice to for the next decade." />

											Today, I&#39;d like to talk with you
											about something that should be
a totally uncontroversial topic.
											But, unfortunately,
it&#39;s become incredibly controversial.

											This year, if you think about it,
											over a billion couples
will have sex with one another.
											Couples like this one,
											and this one,
											and this one,
											and, yes,
											even this one.

											And my idea is this —
											all these men and women
should be free to decide
											whether they do or do not
want to conceive a child.
											And they should be able to use
one of these birth control methods
											to act on their decision.
											Now, I think you&#39;d have a hard time
											finding many people
who disagree with this idea.
											Over one billion people use birth control
without any hesitation at all.
											They want the power
to plan their own lives
											and to raise healthier, better educated
and more prosperous families.

											But, for an idea that is
so broadly accepted in private,
											birth control certainly generates
a lot of opposition in public.
											Some people think
when we talk about contraception
											that it&#39;s code for abortion,
											which it&#39;s not.
											Some people — let&#39;s be honest —
											they&#39;re uncomfortable with the topic
because it&#39;s about sex.
											Some people worry
											that the real goal of family planning
is to control populations.
											These are all side issues
											that have attached themselves
to this core idea that men and women
											should be able to decide
when they want to have a child.
											And as a result, birth control has
almost completely and totally disappeared
											from the global health agenda.

											The victims of this paralysis
are the people of sub-Saharan Africa
											and South Asia.
											Here in Germany, the proportion of people
that use contraception
											is about 66 percent.
											That&#39;s about what you&#39;d expect.
											In El Salvador, very similar, 66 percent.
											Thailand, 64 percent.
											But let&#39;s compare that to other places,
											like Uttar Pradesh,
one of the largest states in India.
											In fact, if Uttar Pradesh
was its own country,
											it would be the fifth largest
country in the world.
											Their contraception rate — 29 percent.
											Nigeria, the most populous
country in Africa, 10 percent.
											Chad, 2 percent.
											Let&#39;s just take one country
in Africa, Senegal.
											Their rate is about 12 percent.

											But why is it so low?
											One reason is that the most popular
contraceptives are rarely available.
											Women in Africa will tell you
over and over again
											that what they prefer today
is an injectable.
											They get it in their arm —
and they go about four times a year,
											they have to get it every three months —
to get their injection.
											The reason women like it so much in Africa
is they can hide it from their husbands,
											who sometimes want a lot of children.
											The problem is every other time
a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal,
											that injection is stocked out.
											It&#39;s stocked out 150 days out of the year.
											So can you imagine the situation —
											she walks all this way
to go get her injection.

has become a life-and-death crisis.

											When I grew up,
I grew up in a Catholic home.

a practicing Catholic.

talking about contraception
											is this lingering concern

											For 250 years, parents around the world
											have been deciding
to have smaller families.
											This trend has been steady
for a quarter of a millennium,
											across cultures and across geographies,
											with the glaring exception
of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
											The French started bringing down
their family size in the mid-1700s.
											And over the next 150 years,
this trend spread all across Europe.
											The surprising thing to me,
as I learned this history,
											was that it spread not along socioeconomic
lines but around cultural lines.
											People who spoke the same language
made that change as a group.
											They made the same choice
for their family,
											whether they were rich
or whether they were poor.
											The reason that trend
toward smaller families spread
											was that this whole way
was driven by an idea —
											the idea that couples
can exercise conscious control
											over how many children they have.
											This is a very powerful idea.
											It means that parents have
the ability to affect the future,
											not just accept it as it is.

											In France, the average family size
went down every decade
											for 150 years in a row
until it stabilized.
											It took so long back then because
the contraceptives weren&#39;t that good.
											In Germany, this transition started
in the 1880s, and it took just 50 years
											for family size
to stabilize in this country.
											And in Asia and Latin America,
the transition started in the 1960s,

											I think, as we go through this history,
it&#39;s important to pause for a moment
											and to remember why this has become
such a contentious issue.
											It&#39;s because some family planning programs
											resorted to unfortunate incentives
and coercive policies.
											For instance, in the 1960s, India
adopted very specific numeric targets
											and they paid women to accept
having an IUD placed in their bodies.
											Now, Indian women were
really smart in this situation.
											When they went to get an IUD inserted,
they got paid six rupees.
											And so what did they do?
											They waited a few hours or a few days,
											and they went to another service provider
and had the IUD removed for one rupee.
											For decades in the United States,
											African-American women
were sterilized without their consent.
											The procedure was so common
											it became known as
the Mississippi appendectomy —
											a tragic chapter in my country&#39;s history.
											And as recently as the 1990s, in Peru,
											women from the Andes region
were given anesthesia
											and they were sterilized
without their knowledge.

									<p>
											The most startling thing about this
											is that these coercive policies
weren&#39;t even needed.
											They were carried out in places
											where parents already
wanted to lower their family size.
											Because in region after region,
again and again,
											parents have wanted
to have smaller families.
											There&#39;s no reason to believe
											that African women
have innately different desires.
											Given the option,
they will have fewer children.
											The question is:
											will we invest in helping
all women get what they want now?
											Or, are we going to condemn them
to some century-long struggle,
											as if this was still revolutionary France
											and the best method
was coitus interruptus?

											Empowering parents —
it doesn&#39;t need justification.
											But here&#39;s the thing — our desire
to bring every good thing to our children
											is a force for good throughout the world.
											It&#39;s what propels societies forward.
											In that same slum in Nairobi,
I met a young businesswoman,
											and she was making backpacks
out of her home.
											She and her young kids
would go to the local jeans factory
											and collect scraps of denim.
											She&#39;d create these backpacks
and resell them.
											And when I talked with her,
she had three children,
											and I asked her about her family.
											And she said she and her husband decided
											that they wanted to stop
having children after their third one.
											And so when I asked her why,
she simply said,
											&quot;Well, because I couldn&#39;t run
my business if I had another child.&quot;
											And she explained the income
that she was getting out of her business
											afforded her to be able to give
an education to all three of her children.
											She was incredibly optimistic
about her family&#39;s future.
											This is the same mental calculus
											that hundreds of millions
of men and women have gone through.
											And evidence proves
that they have it exactly right.
											They are able to give their children
more opportunities
											by exercising control
over when they have them.

											In Bangladesh,
											there&#39;s a district called Matlab.
											It&#39;s where researchers have collected data
on over 180,000 inhabitants since 1963.
											In the global health community,
											we like to say it&#39;s one of the longest
pieces of research that&#39;s been running.
											We have so many great health statistics.
											In one of the studies, what did they do?
											Half the villagers
were chosen to get contraceptives.
											They got education
and access to contraception.
											Twenty years later,
following those villages,
											what we learned is that they had a better
quality of life than their neighbors.
											The families were healthier.
											The women were less likely
to die in childbirth.
											Their children were less likely
to die in the first thirty days of life.
											The children were better nourished.
											The families were also wealthier.
											The adult women&#39;s wages were higher.
											Households had more assets —
things like livestock or land or savings.
											Finally, their sons and daughters
had more schooling.
											So when you multiply these types
of effects over millions of families,
											the product can be large-scale
economic development.
											People talk about the Asian
economic miracle of the 1980s —

											CA: Melinda, I&#39;m guessing that some
of those nuns who taught you at school
											are going to see
this TED Talk at some point.
											Are they going to be horrified,
or are they cheering you on?

											MG: I know they&#39;re going
to see the TED Talk
											because they know that I&#39;m doing it
and I plan to send it to them.
											And, you know, the nuns who taught me
were incredibly progressive.
											I hope that they&#39;ll be very proud of me
											for living out what they taught us
about social justice and service.
											I have come to feel
incredibly passionate about this issue
											because of what I&#39;ve seen
in the developing world.
											And for me, this topic
has become very close to heart
											because you meet these women
and they are so often voiceless.
											And yet they shouldn&#39;t be —
											they should have a voice,
they should have access.
											And so I hope they&#39;ll feel
											that I&#39;m living out
what I&#39;ve learned from them
											and from the decades of work
that I&#39;ve already done at the foundation.

											MG: Oh my gosh, I learned so many things.
I have so many follow-up questions.
											And I think a lot
of this work is a journey.
											You heard the discussion
about the journey through energy,
											or the journey through social design,
											or the journey in the coming and saying,
											&quot;Why aren&#39;t there any women
on this platform?&quot;
											And I think for all of us who work
on these development issues,
											you learn by talking to other people.
											You learn by doing.
You learn by trying and making mistakes.
											And it&#39;s the questions you ask.
											Sometimes it&#39;s the questions you ask
that helps lead to the answer
											the next person
that can help you answer it.
											So I have lots of questions
for the panelists from today.
											And I thought it was just an amazing day.

In 2012, Gates spearheaded the London Summit on Family Planning, with the goal of delivering contraceptives to 120 million women in developing countries by 2020. When asked why she got involved in this issue, Gates said, &quot;We knew that 210 million women were saying they wanted access to the contraceptives we have here in the United States and we weren&#39;t providing them because of political controversy in our country. To me, that was just a crime. I kept looking around trying to find the person to get this back on the global stage.

Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.</p><p>In recent years, Melinda French Gates has become a vocal advocate for access to contraception, advancing the idea that empowering women to decide whether and when to have children can have transformational effects on societies. In 2012, Gates spearheaded the London Summit on Family Planning, with the goal of delivering contraceptives to 120 million women in developing countries by 2020. When asked why she got involved in this issue, Gates said, &quot;We knew that 210 million women were saying they wanted access to the contraceptives we have here in the United States and we weren&#39;t providing them because of political controversy in our country. To me, that was just a crime. I kept looking around trying to find the person to get this back on the global stage. I realized I just had to do it.&quot;</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Melinda Gates","tags":["TEDx","culture","global issues","health care","population","sex"],"title":"Let's put birth control back on the agenda","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1174965}]}
