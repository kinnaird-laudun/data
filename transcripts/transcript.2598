<title>Michelle Knox: Talk about your death while you&#39;re still healthy | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Do you know what you want when you die? Do you know how you want to be remembered? In a candid, heartfelt talk about a subject most of us would rather not discuss, Michelle Knox asks each of us to reflect on our core values around death and share them with our loved ones, so they can make informed decisions without fear of having failed to honor our legacies. &quot;Life would be a lot easier to live if we talked about death now,&quot; Knox says. &quot;We need to discuss these issues when we are fit and healthy so we can take the emotion out of it -- and then we can learn not just what is important, but why it&#39;s important.&quot;" />

<meta content='Do you know what you want when you die? Do you know how you want to be remembered? In a candid, heartfelt talk about a subject most of us would rather not discuss, Michelle Knox asks each of us to reflect on our core values around death and share them with our loved ones, so they can make informed decisions without fear of having failed to honor our legacies. "Life would be a lot easier to live if we talked about death now," Knox says. "We need to discuss these issues when we are fit and healthy so we can take the emotion out of it — and then we can learn not just what is important, but why it&#x0027;s important."' itemprop='description'>

											To kick the bucket,
											bite the dust,
											cash in your chips,
											check out, depart, expire,
											launch into eternity ...
											These are all euphemisms we use in humor
											to describe the one life event
we are all going to experience:
											death.
											But most of us don&#39;t want
to acknowledge death,
											we don&#39;t want to plan for it,

											I grew up in an Australian community
where people got old or sick
											and passed away,
											and only the adults attended the funeral.
											My parents would come home
looking sad and drained,
											but they didn&#39;t discuss it with us.
											So I was ignorant to death
and of the grieving process.
											At 15, I got my invitation.
											A dear neighbor who was like an aunt to me
											died suddenly of a heart attack,
											and I attended my first funeral
and did my first reading.
											I didn&#39;t know the tightness in my chest
and the dryness in my mouth was normal.
											The celebrant got some of the facts wrong,
and it made me really angry.
											He talked about how she loved knitting.

											A great example of this

											During Sorry Business,

specific roles and responsibilities,

the use of photographs,

											These customs can be a complete contrast

											For most of us, we wait
until we are too emotional,

											When it comes to death,
there&#39;s so much to discuss,
											but I want to focus on two aspects:
											why talking about and planning your death
can help you experience a good death,
											and then reduce the stress
on your loved ones;
											and how talking about death can help us
support those who are grieving.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let&#39;s start with planning.
											How many of you have a will?
											Put your hand up.
											Oh, this is fantastic.
											In Australia, 45 percent
of adults over the age of 18
											do not have a legal will.
											You&#39;re a little bit above average.
											This is a startling statistic
											given that writing a will can actually
be quite simple and inexpensive.
											So I started asking
my friends and neighbors
											and was really surprised to learn
many of them don&#39;t have a will,
											and some couples don&#39;t realize
they need individual wills.
											The usual explanation was, well,
it&#39;s all going to go to my partner anyway.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So keep in mind that laws vary
											from state to state
and country to country,
											but this is what happens
in New South Wales
											if you die without leaving a legal will.
											Firstly, a suitable administrator
must be appointed
											by the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
											Chances are this is someone
who would never have met the deceased.
											That person is then responsible
for arranging your funeral,
											collecting assets and distributing them
after paying debts and taxes.
											And one of those debts
will be the bill for their services.
											This is not someone who would have known
											you want the four-foot
wooden giraffe in your living room
											to go to the person who helped you
carry it halfway across the world,
											and yes, that&#39;s in my will.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											If you die leaving a spouse
or a domestic partner,
											then chances are
they will receive your estate,
											but if you are single,
it&#39;s far more complicated,
											as parents, siblings, half-siblings
and dependents all come into play.
											And did you know that if you make
a regular donation to charity,
											that charity may have grounds
to make a claim on your estate?
											The most important thing to know
is the bigger your estate,
											the more complicated that will will be,
											and the more expensive that bill.
											So if you don&#39;t have a will, I ask you ...
											when else in your life
											have you willingly given money
to the government
											when you didn&#39;t have to?

											I lost my father in February
to a progressive lung disease.
											When dad knew his death was imminent,
											he had three clear wishes.
											He wanted to die at home;
											he wanted to die surrounded by family;
											and he wanted to die peacefully,
not choking or gasping for air.
											And I&#39;m pleased to say that my family
were able to support dad&#39;s wishes,
											and he achieved his goals,
											and in that sense, he had a good death.
											He had the death he planned for.
											Because dad wanted to die at home,
											we had to have some
pretty tough conversations
											and fill out a lot of paperwork.
											The questions on the forms cover everything
from resuscitation to organ donation.
											Dad said, &quot;Take whatever
organs you can use.&quot;
											This was upsetting to my mum,
											as my dad&#39;s health
was deteriorating rapidly,
											and it was no longer the right time
to talk about organ donation.

											It&#39;s different for all of us,

that we acknowledge that.
											So if we don&#39;t talk about our death
and the death of loved ones,
											how can we possibly support
a friend, a colleague, a neighbor
											who is grieving?
											How do we support someone
who has lost someone suddenly,
											like an accident or suicide?

to fill that awkward silence,
