											Clearly, we&#39;re living in a moment of crisis.
											Arguably the financial markets have failed us
											and the aid system is failing us,
											and yet I stand firmly with the optimists
											who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
											Because of some of technologies we&#39;ve been talking about.
											Because of the resources, the skills,
											and certainly the surge of talent we&#39;re seeing all around the world,
											with the mindset to create change.
											And we&#39;ve got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,
											who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,
											but that we&#39;ve got to engage in a different way with the world.

											And by definition, every one of you who is in this room
											must consider yourself a global soul,

											You work on the front lines. And you&#39;ve seen the best and the worst
											that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
											And no matter what country you live or work in,
											you&#39;ve also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,
											even in their most ordinariness.

											Today there is a raging debate
											as to how best we lift people out of poverty,
											how best we release their energies.
											On the one hand, we have people that say
											the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
											And on the other we have people who say
											the problem is that we need more aid.
											And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
											We call it patient capital.

											The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent
											in Africa since 1970
											and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation
											and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
											They use Mobutu as metaphor.
											And their policy prescription is to
											make government more accountable,
											focus on the capital markets,
											invest, don&#39;t give anything away.

											On the other side, as I said, there are those who say
											the problem is that we need more money.
											That when it comes to the rich, we&#39;ll bail out
											and we&#39;ll hand a lot of aid,
											but when it comes to our poor brethren,
											we want little to do with it.
											They point to the successes of aid:
											the eradication of smallpox,
											and the distribution of tens of millions
											of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
											Both sides are right.
											And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
											Even more problematic, they&#39;re not listening to
											poor people themselves.

											After 25 years of working on issues of
											poverty and innovation,
											it&#39;s true that there are probably no more market-oriented
											individuals on the planet
											than low-income people.
											They must navigate markets daily,
											making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,
											to move their way through society,
											and yet if a single catastrophic health problem
											impacts their family,
											they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
											And so we need both the market

											Patient capital works between,
											and tries to take the best of both.
											It&#39;s money that&#39;s invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities
											and are building solutions
											to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,
											thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,
											but as individual customers, consumers, clients,
											people who want to make decisions in their own lives.

											Patient capital requires that we have
											incredible tolerance for risk,
											a long time horizon in terms of allowing those
											entrepreneurs time to experiment,
											to use the market as the best listening device that we have,
											and the expectation of below-market returns,
											but outsized social impact.
											It recognizes that the market has its limitation,
											and so patient capital also works
											with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy
											to include all people.

											Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital
											for three reasons.
											First, they tend to work in markets

											I want to share one story
											about an innovation called drip irrigation.
											In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur
											named Amitabha Sadangi from India,
											who&#39;d been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
											And he was expressing his frustration
											that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,
											despite the fact that 200 million farmers
											alone in India make under a dollar a day.
											They were creating subsidies
											either for large farms,
											or they were giving inputs to the farmers
											that they thought they should use, rather than
											that the farmers wanted to use.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											At the same time Amitabha was
											obsessed with this drip irrigation technology
											that had been invented in Israel.
											It was a way of bringing small amounts of water
											directly to the stalk of the plant.
											And it could transform
											swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
											But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,
											because these systems were both too expensive,
											and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
											The average small village farmer
											works on two acres or less.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation
											and he would redesign it from the perspective
											of the poor farmers themselves,
											because he spent so many years listening to what they needed
											not what he thought that they should have.
											And he used three fundamental principles.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The first one was miniaturization.
											The drip irrigation system
											had to be small enough that a farmer only had
											to risk a quarter acre,
											even if he had two,
											because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
											Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
											In other words, that risk on the quarter acre
											needed to be repaid in a single harvest,
											or else they wouldn&#39;t take the risk.
											And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls
											infinitely expandable.
											What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,
											the farmers could buy a second
											and a third and a fourth.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											As of today, IDE India, Amitabha&#39;s organization,
											has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems
											and has seen their yields and incomes
											double or triple on average,
											but this didn&#39;t happen overnight.
											In fact, when you go back to the beginning,
											there were no private investors
											who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology
											for a market class that made under a dollar a day,
											that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet
											and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.

									<p>
											And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants
											to research, to experiment, to fail,
											to innovate and try again.
											And when he had a prototype
											and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,
											that&#39;s when patient capital could come in.
											And we helped him build a company, for profit,
											that would build on IDE&#39;s knowledge,
											and start looking at sales and exports,
											and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.

											Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export
											this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
											And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
											And while, again, you needed patience
											to move a technology for the poor
											in India into Pakistan,
											just to get the permits,
											over time we were able to start a company
											with Dr. Sono, who runs a large
											community development organization in the Thar Desert,
											which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
											And though that company has just started,
											our assumption is that there too
											we&#39;ll see the impact on millions.

											We&#39;re starting to see these happening all around the world.

											President Obama understands that.

											And I would submit that it&#39;s time to consider
											a global innovation fund
											that would find these entrepreneurs around the world
											who really have innovations, not only for their country,
											but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
											Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.

											When we think about new approaches to aid,
											it&#39;s impossible not to talk about Pakistan.
											We&#39;ve had a rocky relationship with that country

											But again I would say that this is our moment
											for extraordinary things to happen.
											And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,
											we could use this time to invest
											not directly in government, though we would have government&#39;s blessing,

											to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,
											provide real pathways to hope.

											Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth

											And yet these are the very qualities

So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.

Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/jacqueline_novogratz_a_third_way_to_think_about_aid","viewed_count":461535,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"The debate over foreign aid often pits those who mistrust \"charity\" against those who mistrust reliance on the markets.

Her organization, Acumen, invests in people, companies and ideas that see capital and networks as means, not ends, to solving the toughest issues of poverty.","whylisten":"<p>Jacqueline Novogratz writes: &quot;I want to build a movement in which we define success based on the amount of human energy we release in the world. </p><p>&quot;I started my career on Wall Street and soon discovered that markets are efficient, but by themselves they too often overlook or exploit the poor.  So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jacqueline Novogratz","tags":["Africa","business","economics","global issues","innovation","invention","poverty","women","global development","philanthropy","inequality","markets"],"title":"A third way to think about aid","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":461535}]}
