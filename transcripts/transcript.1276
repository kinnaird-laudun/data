											Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed
											that the vast majority of brain development
											takes place in the first few years of life.
											Back then, 15 years ago, we didn&#39;t have the ability
											to look inside the living human brain
											and track development across the lifespan.
											In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances
											in brain imaging technology
											such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,
											neuroscientists have started to look inside the living
											human brain of all ages, and to track changes
											in brain structure and brain function,
											so we use structural MRI if you&#39;d like to take a snapshot,
											a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside
											of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,
											how much gray matter does the brain contain,
											and how does that change with age?
											And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI,
											to take a video, a movie, of brain activity
											when participants are taking part in some kind of task
											like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So many labs around the world are involved in this kind
											of research, and we now have a really rich
											and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops,
											and this picture has radically changed the way
											we think about human brain development
											by revealing that it&#39;s not all over in early childhood,
											and instead, the brain continues to develop
											right throughout adolescence and into the &#39;20s and &#39;30s.
									</p>

											So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts
											with the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty
											and ends at the age at which an individual attains
											a stable, independent role in society.
											(Laughter)
											It can go on a long time. (Laughter)
											One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically
											during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.
											So this is a model of the human brain,
											and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.
											Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.
											It&#39;s proportionally much bigger in humans than
											in any other species, and it&#39;s involved in a whole range of
											high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making,
											planning, planning what you&#39;re going to do tomorrow
											or next week or next year, inhibiting
											inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying
											something really rude or doing something really stupid.
											It&#39;s also involved in social interaction,
											understanding other people, and self-awareness.
									</p>

									<p>
											So MRI studies looking at the development of this region
											have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development
											during the period of adolescence.
											So if you look at gray matter volume, for example,
											gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years
											increases during childhood, which is what you can see
											on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.
											The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume
											in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens
											a couple of years later in boys relative to girls,
											and that&#39;s probably because boys go through puberty
											a couple of years later than girls on average,
											and then during adolescence, there&#39;s a significant decline
											in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.
											Now that might sound bad, but actually this is
											a really important developmental process, because
											gray matter contains cell bodies and connections
											between cells, the synapses, and this decline
											in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex
											is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning,
											the elimination of unwanted synapses.
											This is a really important process. It&#39;s partly dependent
											on the environment that the animal or the human is in,
											and the synapses that are being used are strengthened,
											and synapses that aren&#39;t being used
											in that particular environment are pruned away.
											You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.
											You prune away the weaker branches so that
											the remaining, important branches, can grow stronger,
											and this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue
											according to the species-specific environment,
											is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions
											during the period of human adolescence.

											So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes
											in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI
											to look at changes in brain activity across age.
											So I&#39;ll just give you an example from my lab.
											So in my lab, we&#39;re interested in the social brain, that is
											the network of brain regions that we use to understand
											other people and to interact with other people.
											So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game
											to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.
											So this is a soccer game. (Laughter)
											Michael Owen has just missed a goal, and he&#39;s lying
											on the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain
											that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic
											and instinctive social emotional responses are,
											so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal,
											everyone is doing the same thing with their arms
											and the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen
											as he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing
											with his arms, and presumably has a similar
											facial expression, and the only people who don&#39;t
											are the guys in yellow at the back — (Laughs) —
											and I think they&#39;re on the wrong end of the stadium,
											and they&#39;re doing another social emotional response
											that we all instantly recognize, and that&#39;s the second aspect
											of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates,
											how good we are at reading other people&#39;s behavior,
											their actions, their gestures, their facial expressions,
											in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.
											So you don&#39;t have to ask any of these guys.
											You have a pretty good idea of what they&#39;re feeling
											and thinking at this precise moment in time.

									<p>
											So that&#39;s what we&#39;re interested in looking at in my lab.
											So in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab
											to have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task
											that involves thinking about other people, their minds,
											their mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings
											that we&#39;ve found several times now, as have other labs
											around the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called
											medial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide,
											and it&#39;s right in the middle of prefrontal cortex
											in the midline of your head.
											This region is more active in adolescents when they make
											these social decisions and think about other people
											than it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis
											of nine different studies in this area from labs around
											the world, and they all show the same thing, that activity
											in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases
											during the period of adolescence.
											And we think that might be because adolescents and adults
											use a different mental approach, a different
											cognitive strategy, to make social decisions,
											and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies
											whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them
											some kind of behavioral task, and I&#39;ll just give you
											another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.

									<p>
											So imagine that you&#39;re the participant in one of our
											experiments. You come into the lab,
											you see this computerized task.
											In this task, you see a set of shelves.
											Now, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them,
											and you&#39;ll notice there&#39;s a guy standing behind the set
											of shelves, and there are some objects that he can&#39;t see.
											They&#39;re occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of
											gray piece of wood.
											This is the same set of shelves from his point of view.
											Notice that there are only some objects that he can see,
											whereas there are many more objects that you can see.
											Now your task is to move objects around.
											The director, standing behind the set of shelves,
											is going to direct you to move objects around,
											but remember, he&#39;s not going to ask you to move objects
											that he can&#39;t see. This introduces a really interesting
											condition whereby there&#39;s a kind of conflict
											between your perspective and the director&#39;s perspective.
											So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.
											There are three trucks there. You&#39;re going to instinctively
											go for the white truck, because that&#39;s the top truck
											from your perspective, but then you have to remember,
											&quot;Oh, he can&#39;t see that truck, so he must mean
											me to move the blue truck,&quot; which is the top truck
											from his perspective. Now believe it or not,
											normal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors
											about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.
											They move the white truck instead of the blue truck.
											So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults,
											and we also have a control condition
											where there&#39;s no director and instead we give people a rule.
											We tell them, okay, we&#39;re going to do exactly the same thing
											but this time there&#39;s no director. Instead you&#39;ve got to
											ignore objects with the dark gray background.
											You&#39;ll see that this is exactly the same condition, only
											in the no-director condition they just have to remember
											to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas
											in the director condition, they have to remember
											to take into account the director&#39;s perspective
											in order to guide their ongoing behavior.

									<p>
											Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors
											in a large developmental study we did,
											this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood,
											and what you&#39;re going to see is the percentage errors
											in the adult group in both conditions,
											so the gray is the director condition, and you see
											that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent
											of the time, whereas they make far fewer errors
											when there&#39;s no director present, when they just have
											to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.
											Developmentally, these two conditions develop
											in exactly the same way. Between late childhood
											and mid-adolescence, there&#39;s an improvement,
											in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials,
											in both of these conditions.
											But it&#39;s when you compare the last two groups,
											the mid-adolescent group and the adult group
											where things get really interesting, because there, there is
											no continued improvement in the no-director condition.
											In other words, everything you need to do in order to
											remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed
											by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast,
											if you look at the last two gray bars, there&#39;s still
											a significant improvement in the director condition
											between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what
											this means is that the ability to take into account someone
											else&#39;s perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior,
											which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all
											the time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.
											So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you
											sometimes think they have problems taking other people&#39;s
											perspectives, you&#39;re right. They do. And this is why.

											So we sometimes laugh about teenagers.
											They&#39;re parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media
											for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks,
											they&#39;re sometimes moody, they&#39;re very self-conscious.
											I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine
											who said that the thing he noticed most
											about his teenage daughters before and after puberty
											was their level of embarrassment in front of him.
											So, he said, &quot;Before puberty, if my two daughters
											were messing around in a shop, I&#39;d say, &#39;Hey,
											stop messing around and I&#39;ll sing your favorite song,&#39;
											and instantly they&#39;d stop messing around and he&#39;d sing
											their favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.
											(Laughter)
											The very notion of their dad singing in public
											was enough to make them behave.

									<p>
											So people often ask,
											&quot;Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?
											Is it something we&#39;ve invented recently in the West?&quot;
											And actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots
											of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound
											very similar to the descriptions we use today.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So there&#39;s a famous quote by Shakespeare from &quot;The Winter&#39;s Tale&quot;
											where he describes adolescence as follows:
											&quot;I would there were no age between ten and
											three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest;
											for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches
											with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting.&quot; (Laughter)
											He then goes on to say, &quot;Having said that, would any
											but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
											hunt in this weather?&quot; (Laughter)
											So almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying
											adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we
											portray them in today, but today we try to understand
											their behavior in terms of the underlying changes
											that are going on in their brain.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents
											have a tendency to take risks. They do.
											They take more risks than children or adults,
											and they are particularly prone to taking risks
											when they&#39;re with their friends. There&#39;s an important drive
											to become independent from one&#39;s parents
											and to impress one&#39;s friends in adolescence.
											But now we try to understand that in terms of
											the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system,
											so I&#39;m going to show you the limbic system in red
											in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.
											So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain,
											and it&#39;s involved in things like emotion processing
											and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling
											out of doing fun things, including taking risks.
											It gives you the kick out of taking risks.
											And this region, the regions within the limbic system,
											have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding
											feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults,
											and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex,
											which you can see in blue in the slide here,
											which stops us taking excessive risks,
											is still very much in development in adolescents.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain
											undergoes really quite profound development,
											and this has implications for education, for rehabilitation,
											and intervention. The environment, including teaching,
											can and does shape the developing adolescent brain,
											and yet it&#39;s only relatively recently that we have been
											routinely educating teenagers in the West.
											All four of my grandparents, for example, left school
											in their early adolescence. They had no choice.
											And that&#39;s still the case for many, many teenagers
											around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers
											don&#39;t have access to secondary school education.
											And yet, this is a period of life where the brain is
											particularly adaptable and malleable.
											It&#39;s a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what&#39;s sometimes seen as the problem
											with adolescents — heightened risk-taking, poor impulse
											control, self-consciousness — shouldn&#39;t be stigmatized.
											It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide
											an excellent opportunity for education
											and social development. Thank you. (Applause)
