											Hey guys.
											It&#39;s funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver,
											because that was, like, I loved it,
											and when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill
											and I was like, &quot;Hey, Mom, I&#39;m going to Olive Garden.&quot;
											And — (Drilling noise) (Laughter)
											And it worked really well there.
											And you know, it had a profound effect on me.
											It sounds silly, but I thought, okay,
											the way the world works can be changed,
											and it can be changed by me in these small ways.
											And my relationship to
											especially human-made objects
											which someone else said they work like this,
											well, I can say they work a different way, a little bit.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so, about 20 years later,
											I didn&#39;t realize the full effect of this,
											but I went to Costa Rica
											and I stayed with these Guaymí natives there,
											and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them,
											and they could make beds out of trees,
											and they could — I watched this woman for three days.
											I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart,
											these little threads off of it, and she&#39;d roll the threads together
											and make little thicker threads, like strings,
											and she would weave the strings together,
											and as the materiality of this exact very bag
											formed before my eyes over those three days,
											the materiality of the way the world works,
											of reality, kind of started to unravel in my mind,
											because I realized that this bag and these clothes
											and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener,
											everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock
											or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to,
											maybe a more complicated one, but still, everything was made that way.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so I had to start studying,
											who is it that&#39;s making these decisions?
											Who&#39;s making these things? How did they make them?
											What stops us from making them?
											Because this is how reality is created.
											So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab,
											and I was studying the maker movement
											and makers and creativity.
											And I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís
											doing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp,
											where there&#39;s unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out
											and willing to try anything.
											So I said, &quot;Let&#39;s go into the woods near this stream
											and just put stuff together, you know, make something,
											I don&#39;t care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you.
											We won&#39;t bring anything with us.
											And, like, within minutes, this is very easy for adults
											and teens to do.
											Here&#39;s a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream,
											and the shape of an oak leaf being made
											by other small oak leaves being put together.
											A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass.
											The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom
											being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it.
											And after about 45 minutes, you get really intricate projects
											like leaves sorted by hue, so you get a color fade
											and put in a circle like a wreath.

											We think we already know how something works,

											So kids don&#39;t have as hard of a time with this,

											I&#39;m a good hippie dad, so I&#39;m like,
											&quot;Okay, you&#39;re going to learn to love the moon.
											I&#39;m going to give you some building blocks

											And at this point, I&#39;m starting to wonder,
											what kind of tools can we give people,
											especially adults, who know too much,
											so that they can see the world as malleable,
											so they see themselves as agents of change
											in their everyday lives.
											Because the most advanced scientists are really
											just kind of pushing the way the world itself works,
											pushing what matter can do,
											the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium,
											and any sufficiently complicated task,
											whether you&#39;re a cook or a carpenter or you&#39;re raising a child —

											This is a little piano circuit right in here,

											And that&#39;s awesome, right?
											But this is not what&#39;s awesome.
											What&#39;s awesome is what happens
											when you give the piano circuit to people.
											A pencil is not just a pencil.
											Look what it has in the middle of it.
											That&#39;s a wire running down the middle,
											and not only is it a wire,
											if you take that piano circuit, you can thumbtack
											into the middle of a pencil,
											and you can lay out wire on the page, too,
											and get electrical current to run through it.
											And so you can kind of hack a pencil,
											just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit.

											And the electricity runs through your body too.
											And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil.
											You can make one of these brushes just on the fly.
											All you do is connect to the bristles,
											and the bristles are wet, so they conduct,
											and the person&#39;s body conducts,
											and leather is great to paint on,
											and then you can start hooking to everything,
											even the kitchen sink.
											The metal in the sink is conductive.

											I don&#39;t even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.
											And this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper,

											she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there.
											You can see her pointing to it in the picture.
											And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body,

											I ran these workshops everywhere.
											In Taiwan, at an art museum, this 12-year-old girl
											made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan
											and some electrical tape and hot glue.
											And professional designers were making artifacts
											with this thing strapped onto it.
											And big companies like Intel
											or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump,
											were inviting me to give workshops,
											just to practice this idea of smashing electronics
											and everyday objects together.
											And then we came up with this idea
											to not just use electronics,
											but let&#39;s just smash computers with everyday objects
											and see how that goes over.

											And so I just want to do a quick demo.
											So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit,

											So I&#39;ll just plug it in, and now it&#39;s on by USB.
											And I&#39;ll just hook up the forward arrow.
											You guys are facing that way, so I&#39;ll hook it to this one.
											And I&#39;ll just hook up a little ground wire to it.
											And now, if I touch this piece of pizza,
											the slides that I showed you before should go forward.
											And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it
											to the left arrow, I&#39;m kind of programming it by where I hook it up,
											now I have a left arrow and a right arrow,
