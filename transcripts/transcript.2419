											to many of the poorest
countries in the world.

											This scene is one
I see all the time everywhere,
											and these young children
are looking at a smartphone,
											and the smartphone is having a huge impact
in even the poorest countries.
											I said to my team, you know,
											what I see is a rise in aspirations
all over the world.
											In fact, it seems to me
that there&#39;s a convergence of aspirations.
											And I asked a team of economists
to actually look into this.
											Is this true?
											Are aspirations converging
all around the world?
											So they looked at things like Gallup polls
about satisfaction in life
											and what they learned was
that if you have access to the internet,
											your satisfaction goes up.
											But another thing happens
that&#39;s very important:
											your reference income,
											the income to which you compare your own,
											also goes up.
											Now, if the reference income
of a nation, for example,
											goes up 10 percent
											by comparing themselves to the outside,
											then on average,
											people&#39;s own incomes
have to go up at least five percent
											to maintain the same
level of satisfaction.
											But when you get down
into the lower percentiles of income,
											your income has to go up much more
											if the reference income
goes up 10 percent,
											something like 20 percent.
											And so with this rise of aspirations,
											the fundamental question is:
											Are we going to have a situation
											where aspirations
are linked to opportunity
											and you get dynamism and economic growth,
											like that which happened
in the country I was born in, in Korea?
											Or are aspirations
going to meet frustration?

											This is a real concern,
because between 2012 and 2015,
											terrorism incidents
increased by 74 percent.
											The number of deaths from terrorism
went up 150 percent.
											Right now, two billion people
											live in conditions
of fragility, conflict, violence,
											and by 2030, more than 60 percent
of the world&#39;s poor
											will live in these situations
of fragility, conflict and violence.
											And so what do we do
about meeting these aspirations?
											Are there new ways of thinking
											about how we can rise
to meet these aspirations?
											Because if we don&#39;t,
I&#39;m extremely worried.
											Aspirations are rising as never before
because of access to the internet.
											Everyone knows how everyone else lives.
											Has our ability to meet those aspirations
											risen as well?

											And just to get at the details of this,
											I want to share with you
my own personal story.
											This is not my mother,
											but during the Korean War,
											my mother literally took her own sister,
											her younger sister, on her back,
											and walked at least part of the way
											to escape Seoul during the Korean War.
											Now, through a series of miracles,
											my mother and father both got
scholarships to go to New York City.
											They actually met in New York City
and got married in New York City.
											My father, too, was a refugee.
											At the age of 19, he left his family
in the northern part of the country,
											escaped through the border
											and never saw his family again.
											Now, when they were married
and living in New York,
											my father was a waiter
at Patricia Murphy&#39;s restaurant.
											Their aspirations went up.
											They understood what it was like
to live in a place like New York City
											in the 1950s.

											Well, my brother was born
and they came back to Korea,
											and we had what I remember
as kind of an idyllic life,
											but what was happening
in Korea at that time
											was the country was one
of the poorest in the world
											and there was political upheaval.
											There were demonstrations just down
the street from our house all the time,
											students protesting
against the military government.
											And at the time,
											the aspirations of the World Bank Group,
the organization I lead now,
											were extremely low for Korea.
											Their idea was that Korea would
find it difficult without foreign aid
											to provide its people with more
than the bare necessities of life.
											So the situation is
Korea is in a tough position,
											my parents have seen
what life is like in the United States.
											They got married there.
My brother was born there.
											And they felt that in order
to give us an opportunity
											to reach their aspirations for us,
											we had to go and come back
to the United States.

											Now, we came back.
											First we went to Dallas.
											My father did his dental degree
all over again.
											And then we ended up
moving to Iowa, of all places.
											We grew up in Iowa.
											And in Iowa, we went
through the whole course.
											I went to high school, I went to college.
											And then one day,
something that I&#39;ll never forget,
											my father picked me up
after my sophomore year in college,
											and he was driving me home,
											and he said, &quot;Jim,

that we have operated Partners in Health,

on just economic growth

have to shrink their budgets

in health, education and social welfare —

											right now it seems pretty clear to me
that the jobs of the future

in childhood stunting.
											So these are photos from Charles Nelson,
who shared these with us

on the one side, on the left side,
											is a three-month-old who has been stunted:
											not adequate nutrition,
not adequate stimulation.
											And on the other side,
of course, is a normal child,
											and the normal child
has all of these neuronal connections.
											Now, the neuronal connections
are important,
											because that is
the definition of human capital.
											Now, we know that we
can reduce these rates.
											We can reduce these rates
of childhood stunting quickly,
											but if we don&#39;t, India, for example,
with 38 percent childhood stunting,
											how are they going to compete
in the economy of the future
											if 40 percent of their future workers
cannot achieve educationally
											and certainly we worry
about achieving economically
											in a way that will help

											I&#39;m going to leave you
with one final story.
											I was in Tanzania,
and I was in a classroom.
											This is me with a classroom
of 11-year-olds.
											And I asked them, as I always do,
											&quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;
											Two raised their hands and said,
											&quot;I want to be President
of the World Bank.&quot;

									<p>
											And just like you, my own team
and their teachers laughed.
											But then I stopped them.
											I said, &quot;Look, I want to tell you a story.
											When I was born in South Korea,
this is what it looked like.
											This is where I came from.
											And when I was three years old,
											in preschool,
											I don&#39;t think that George David Woods,
the President of the World Bank,
											if he had visited Korea on that day
and come to my classroom,
											that he would have thought
											that the future President
of the World Bank
											was sitting in that classroom.
											Don&#39;t let anyone ever tell you
											that you cannot be
President of the World Bank.&quot;

											I came from a country
that was the poorest in the world.
											I&#39;m President of the World Bank.
											I cannot and I will not
pull up the ladder behind me.
											This is urgent.
											Aspirations are going up.
											Everywhere aspirations are going up.
											You folks in this room, work with us.
											We know that we can find
those Zipline-type solutions
											and help the poor
leapfrog into a better world,

until we work together.
											The future &quot;you&quot; —

									<p>
											CA: Get nerdy. Absolutely.
JYK: So here&#39;s what we did.
											Insurance companies never invest
in developing country infrastructure,
											for example, because
they can&#39;t take the risk.
											They&#39;re holding money
for people who pay for insurance.
											So what we did was a Swedish
International Development Association
											gave us a little bit of money,
											we went out and raised a little bit
more money, a hundred million,
											and we took first loss,
meaning if this thing goes bad,
											10 percent of the loss we&#39;ll just eat,
											and the rest of you will be safe.
											And that created
a 90-percent chunk, tranche
											that was triple B, investment-grade,
so the insurance companies invested.
											So for us, what we&#39;re doing
is taking our public money
											and using it to derisk
specific instruments
											to bring people in from the outside.
											So all of you who are sitting
on trillions of dollars of cash,
											come to us. Right?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											JYK: Absolutely. Absolutely.
											So these will be, for example,
in infrastructure that brings energy,
											builds roads, bridges, ports.
											These kinds of things
are necessary to create jobs,
											but also what we&#39;re saying is
											you may think that the technology
you&#39;re working on
											or the business that you&#39;re working on
											may not have applications
in the developing world,
											but look at Zipline.
											And that Zipline thing didn&#39;t happen
											just because of the quality
of the technology.
											It was because they engaged
with the Rwandans early
											and used artificial intelligence —
											one thing, Rwanda has great broadband —
											but these things fly
completely on their own.
											So we will help you do that.
We will make the introductions.
											We will even provide financing.
We will help you do that.

Soon after he assumed his position in July 2012, the organization established two goals to guide its work: to end extreme poverty by 2030 and to boost shared prosperity, focusing on the bottom 40 percent of the population in developing countries. In September 2016, the World Bank Group Board unanimously reappointed Kim to a second five-year term as president.</p>  <p>During his first term, the World Bank Group supported the development priorities of countries at levels never seen outside a financial crisis and, with its partners, achieved two successive, record replenishments of the World Bank Group&rsquo;s fund for the poorest. The institution also launched several innovative financial instruments, including facilities to address infrastructure needs, prevent pandemics and help the millions of people forcibly displaced from their homes by climate shocks, conflict, and violence.</p>  <p>Kim&#39;s career has revolved around health, education and delivering services to the poor. In 1987, he co-founded Partners In Health, a nonprofit medical organization that works in poor communities on four continents. He has received a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant, was recognized as one of America&#39;s &quot;25 Best Leaders&quot; by U.S. News &amp; World Report and was named one of TIME magazine&#39;s &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/jim_yong_kim_doesn_t_everyone_deserve_a_chance_at_a_good_life","viewed_count":1606018,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"Aspirations are rising as never before across the world, thanks in large part to smartphones and the internet -- will they be met with opportunity or frustration?

poverty and promote shared prosperity.","whylisten":"<p>Jim Yong Kim is the 12th president of the World Bank Group. Soon after he assumed his position in July 2012, the organization established two goals to guide its work: to end extreme poverty by 2030 and to boost shared prosperity, focusing on the bottom 40 percent of the population in developing countries. In September 2016, the World Bank Group Board unanimously reappointed Kim to a second five-year term as president.</p>  <p>During his first term, the World Bank Group supported the development priorities of countries at levels never seen outside a financial crisis and, with its partners, achieved two successive, record replenishments of the World Bank Group&rsquo;s fund for the poorest. The institution also launched several innovative financial instruments, including facilities to address infrastructure needs, prevent pandemics and help the millions of people forcibly displaced from their homes by climate shocks, conflict, and violence.</p>  <p>Kim&#39;s career has revolved around health, education and delivering services to the poor. In 1987, he co-founded Partners In Health, a nonprofit medical organization that works in poor communities on four continents. He has received a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant, was recognized as one of America&#39;s &quot;25 Best Leaders&quot; by U.S. News &amp; World Report and was named one of TIME magazine&#39;s &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jim Yong Kim","tags":["Africa","big problems","business","capitalism","children","collaboration","communication","economics","global issues","future","goal-setting","government","health","history","immigration","humanity","infrastructure","innovation","investment","Internet","politics","refugees","potential","social change","resources","social media","society","global development"],"title":"Doesn't everyone deserve a chance at a good life?","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1606018}]}
