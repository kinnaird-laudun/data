											How do you explain
when things don&#39;t go as we assume?
											Or better, how do you explain
											when others are able to achieve things
that seem to defy all of the assumptions?
											For example:
											Why is Apple so innovative?
											Year after year, after year,
											they&#39;re more innovative
than all their competition.
											And yet, they&#39;re just a computer company.
											They&#39;re just like everyone else.
											They have the same access
to the same talent,
											the same agencies,
											the same consultants, the same media.
											Then why is it that they seem
to have something different?
											Why is it that Martin Luther King
led the Civil Rights Movement?
											He wasn&#39;t the only man
who suffered in pre-civil rights America,
											and he certainly wasn&#39;t
the only great orator of the day.
											Why him?
											And why is it that the Wright brothers
											were able to figure out controlled,
powered man flight
											when there were certainly other teams
											who were better qualified,
better funded —
											and they didn&#39;t achieve
powered man flight,
											and the Wright brothers beat them to it.
											There&#39;s something else at play here.

											About three and a half years ago,
I made a discovery.
											And this discovery profoundly changed
my view on how I thought the world worked,
											and it even profoundly changed the way
in which I operate in it.
											As it turns out, there&#39;s a pattern.
											As it turns out, all the great inspiring
leaders and organizations in the world,
											whether it&#39;s Apple or Martin Luther King
or the Wright brothers,
											they all think, act and communicate
the exact same way.
											And it&#39;s the complete opposite
to everyone else.
											All I did was codify it,
											and it&#39;s probably
the world&#39;s simplest idea.
											I call it the golden circle.

											Why? How? What?
											This little idea explains
											why some organizations and some leaders
are able to inspire where others aren&#39;t.
											Let me define the terms really quickly.
											Every single person, every single
organization on the planet
											knows what they do, 100 percent.
											Some know how they do it,
											whether you call it
your differentiated value proposition
											or your proprietary process or your USP.
											But very, very few people or organizations
know why they do what they do.
											And by &quot;why&quot; I don&#39;t mean
&quot;to make a profit.&quot;
											That&#39;s a result. It&#39;s always a result.
											By &quot;why,&quot; I mean: What&#39;s your purpose?
											What&#39;s your cause? What&#39;s your belief?
											Why does your organization exist?
											Why do you get out of bed in the morning?
											And why should anyone care?
											As a result, the way we think, we act,
											the way we communicate
is from the outside in, it&#39;s obvious.
											We go from the clearest thing
to the fuzziest thing.
											But the inspired leaders
and the inspired organizations —
											regardless of their size,
regardless of their industry —
											all think, act and communicate
from the inside out.

											a purchase, a vote, something like that.
											Here&#39;s our new law firm:
											We have the best lawyers

											&quot;Everything we do,
we believe in challenging the status quo.
											We believe in thinking differently.
											The way we challenge the status quo
											is by making our products
beautifully designed,
											simple to use and user friendly.

											This explains why
every single person in this room
											is perfectly comfortable buying
a computer from Apple.
											But we&#39;re also perfectly comfortable
											buying an MP3 player from Apple,
or a phone from Apple,
											or a DVR from Apple.
											As I said before,
Apple&#39;s just a computer company.
											Nothing distinguishes them structurally
from any of their competitors.
											Their competitors are equally qualified
to make all of these products.
											In fact, they tried.
											A few years ago, Gateway
came out with flat-screen TVs.
											They&#39;re eminently qualified
to make flat-screen TVs.
											They&#39;ve been making
flat-screen monitors for years.
											Nobody bought one.
											Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,
											and they make great quality products,
											and they can make perfectly
well-designed products —
											and nobody bought one.
											In fact, talking about it now,
we can&#39;t even imagine
											buying an MP3 player from Dell.
											Why would you buy one
from a computer company?
											But we do it every day.
											People don&#39;t buy what you do;
they buy why you do it.
											The goal is not to do business
with everybody who needs what you have.
											The goal is to do business with people
who believe what you believe.

											Here&#39;s the best part:
											None of what I&#39;m telling you
is my opinion.
											It&#39;s all grounded
in the tenets of biology.
											Not psychology, biology.
											If you look at a cross-section
of the human brain,
											from the top down,
the human brain is actually broken
											into three major components
											that correlate perfectly
with the golden circle.
											Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,
											our neocortex,
											corresponds with the &quot;what&quot; level.
											The neocortex is responsible
											for all of our rational
and analytical thought and language.
											The middle two sections make up
our limbic brains,
											and our limbic brains are responsible
for all of our feelings,
											like trust and loyalty.
											It&#39;s also responsible
for all human behavior,
											all decision-making,
											and it has no capacity for language.

											In other words, when we communicate
from the outside in,
											yes, people can understand vast
amounts of complicated information
											like features and benefits
and facts and figures.
											It just doesn&#39;t drive behavior.
											When we can communicate
from the inside out,
											we&#39;re talking directly
to the part of the brain
											that controls behavior,
											and then we allow people to rationalize it
with the tangible things we say and do.
											This is where gut decisions come from.
											Sometimes you can give somebody
all the facts and figures,
											and they say, &quot;I know
what all the facts and details say,
											but it just doesn&#39;t feel right.&quot;
											Why would we use that verb,
it doesn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; right?
											Because the part of the brain
that controls decision-making
											doesn&#39;t control language.
											The best we can muster up is,
											&quot;I don&#39;t know. 
It just doesn&#39;t feel right.&quot;
											Or sometimes you say you&#39;re leading
with your heart or soul.
											I hate to break it to you,
those aren&#39;t other body parts

											Most people don&#39;t know
about Samuel Pierpont Langley.
											And back in the early 20th century,
											the pursuit of powered man flight
was like the dot com of the day.
											Everybody was trying it.
											And Samuel Pierpont Langley
had, what we assume,
											to be the recipe for success.
											Even now, you ask people,
											&quot;Why did your product
or why did your company fail?&quot;
											and people always give
you the same permutation
											of the same three things:
											under-capitalized, the wrong people,
bad market conditions.
											It&#39;s always the same three things,
so let&#39;s explore that.
											Samuel Pierpont Langley
											was given 50,000 dollars
by the War Department
											to figure out this flying machine.
											Money was no problem.
											He held a seat at Harvard
											and worked at the Smithsonian
and was extremely well-connected;
											he knew all the big minds of the day.
											He hired the best minds money could find
											and the market conditions were fantastic.
											The New York Times
followed him around everywhere,
											and everyone was rooting for Langley.
											Then how come we&#39;ve never heard
of Samuel Pierpont Langley?

											A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,
											Orville and Wilbur Wright,
											they had none of what we consider
to be the recipe for success.
											They had no money;
											they paid for their dream
with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.
											Not a single person
on the Wright brothers&#39; team
											had a college education,
											not even Orville or Wilbur.
											And The New York Times
followed them around nowhere.

											The difference was,
											Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,
by a purpose, by a belief.
											They believed that if they could
figure out this flying machine,
											it&#39;ll change the course of the world.
											Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.
											He wanted to be rich,
and he wanted to be famous.
											He was in pursuit of the result.
											He was in pursuit of the riches.
											And lo and behold, look what happened.
											The people who believed
in the Wright brothers&#39; dream
											worked with them with blood
and sweat and tears.
											The others just worked for the paycheck.
											They tell stories of how every time
the Wright brothers went out,
											they would have to take
five sets of parts,
											because that&#39;s how many times
they would crash before supper.

											And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,
											the Wright brothers took flight,
											and no one was there
to even experience it.
											We found out about it a few days later.
											And further proof that Langley
was motivated by the wrong thing:
											the day the Wright brothers took flight,
											he quit.
											He could have said,
											&quot;That&#39;s an amazing discovery, guys,
											and I will improve
upon your technology,&quot; but he didn&#39;t.
											He wasn&#39;t first, he didn&#39;t get rich,
he didn&#39;t get famous, so he quit.

											We all sit at various places
at various times on this scale,

of innovation tells us
											is that if you want mass-market success
or mass-market acceptance of an idea,
											you cannot have it
until you achieve this tipping point
											between 15 and 18 percent
market penetration,
											and then the system tips.
											I love asking businesses,
&quot;What&#39;s your conversion on new business?&quot;
											They love to tell you,
&quot;It&#39;s about 10 percent,&quot; proudly.
											Well, you can trip
over 10% of the customers.

											The problem is: How do you

											So it&#39;s this here, this little gap
that you have to close,
											as Jeffrey Moore calls it,
&quot;Crossing the Chasm&quot; —
											because, you see, the early majority
will not try something
											until someone else has tried it first.
											And these guys, the innovators
and the early adopters,
											they&#39;re comfortable
making those gut decisions.
											They&#39;re more comfortable
making those intuitive decisions
											that are driven by what
they believe about the world
											and not just what product is available.
											These are the people who stood
in line for six hours

											when you could have bought one
off the shelf the next week.
											These are the people
who spent 40,000 dollars
											on flat-screen TVs
when they first came out,
											even though the technology
was substandard.
											And, by the way, they didn&#39;t do it
because the technology was so great;
											they did it for themselves.
											It&#39;s because they wanted to be first.
											People don&#39;t buy what you do;
they buy why you do it
											and what you do simply proves
what you believe.
											In fact, people will do the things
that prove what they believe.
											The reason that person bought the iPhone
in the first six hours,
											stood in line for six hours,
											was because of what they believed

Though both valuable, most leadership books are also very hard to implement as prescribed. That’s what makes Marquet’s book is so remarkable. A submarine commander, he used to obey traditional models of leadership … until they failed him. Unable to change any variables (people, technology or equipment), the only thing left for him to change in order to achieve success was how he acted as a leader. Based on real life events, Marquet presents his ideas in a superbly practical way — perfect for implementing.","note":"L.
