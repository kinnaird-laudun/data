<title>Thomas Piketty: New thoughts on capital in the twenty-first century | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: French economist Thomas Piketty caused a sensation in early 2014 with his book on a simple, brutal formula explaining economic inequality: r &amp;gt; g (meaning that return on capital is generally higher than economic growth). Here, he talks through the massive data set that led him to conclude: Economic inequality is not new, but it is getting worse, with radical possible impacts." />

											So I&#39;ve been working on the history of income
											and wealth distribution for the past 15 years,
											and one of the interesting lessons
											coming from this historical evidence
											is indeed that, in the long run,
											there is a tendency for 
the rate of return of capital
											to exceed the economy&#39;s growth rate,
											and this tends to lead to 
high concentration of wealth.
											Not infinite concentration of wealth,
											but the higher the gap between r and g,
											the higher the level of inequality of wealth
											towards which society tends to converge.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So this is a key force that
I&#39;m going to talk about today,
											but let me say right away
											that this is not the only important force
											in the dynamics of income 
and wealth distribution,
											and there are many other forces that play
											an important role in the long-run dynamics
											of income and wealth distribution.
											Also there is a lot of data
											that still needs to be collected.
											We know a little bit more today
											than we used to know, 
but we still know too little,
											and certainly there are 
many different processes —
											economic, social, political —
											that need to be studied more.
											And so I&#39;m going to focus today on this simple force,
											but that doesn&#39;t mean that other important forces
											do not exist.
									</p>

									<p>
											So most of the data I&#39;m going to present
											comes from this database
											that&#39;s available online:
											the World Top Incomes Database.
											So this is the largest existing
											historical database on inequality,
											and this comes from the effort
											of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.
											So let me show you a couple of facts
											coming from this database,
											and then we&#39;ll return to r bigger than g.
											So fact number one is that there has been
											a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality
											between the United States and Europe
											over the past century.
											So back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually
											much higher in Europe than in the United States,
											whereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States.
											So let me be very clear:
											The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.
											It has more to do with changing supply and demand
											for skill, the race between education and technology,
											globalization, probably more unequal access
											to skills in the U.S.,
											where you have very good, very top universities
											but where the bottom part of the educational system
											is not as good,
											so very unequal access to skills,
											and also an unprecedented rise
											of top managerial compensation of the United States,
											which is difficult to account for
just on the basis of education.
											So there is more going on here,
											but I&#39;m not going to talk too much about this today,
											because I want to focus on wealth inequality.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let me just show you a very simple indicator
											about the income inequality part.
											So this is the share of total income
											going to the top 10 percent.
											So you can see that one century ago,
											it was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe
											and a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S.,
											so there was more inequality in Europe.
											Then there was a sharp decline
											during the first half of the 20th century,
											and in the recent decade, you can see that
											the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe,
											and this is the first fact I just talked about.
											Now, the second fact is more about wealth inequality,
											and here the central fact is that wealth inequality
											is always a lot higher than income inequality,
											and also that wealth inequality,
											although it has also increased in recent decades,
											is still less extreme today
											than what it was a century ago,
											although the total quantity of wealth
											relative to income has now recovered
											from the very large shocks
											caused by World War I, the Great Depression,
											World War II.

											So let me show you two graphs
											illustrating fact number two and fact number three.
											So first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality,
											this is the share of total wealth
											going to the top 10 percent of wealth holders,
											so you can see the same kind of reversal
											between the U.S. and Europe that we had before
											for income inequality.
											So wealth concentration was higher
											in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago,
											and now it is the opposite.
											But you can also show two things:
											First, the general level of wealth inequality
											is always higher than income inequality.
											So remember, for income inequality,
											the share going to the top 10 percent
											was between 30 and 50 percent of total income,
											whereas for wealth, the share is always
											between 60 and 90 percent.
											Okay, so that&#39;s fact number one,
											and that&#39;s very important for what follows.
											Wealth concentration is always
											a lot higher than income concentration.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Fact number two is that the rise
											in wealth inequality in recent decades
											is still not enough to get us back to 1910.
											So the big difference today,
											wealth inequality is still very large,
											with 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10,
											but the good news is that it&#39;s actually
											better than one century ago,
											where you had 90 percent in
Europe going to the top 10.
											So today what you have
											is what I call the middle 40 percent,
											the people who are not in the top 10
											and who are not in the bottom 50,
											and what you can view as the wealth middle class
											that owns 20 to 30 percent
											of total wealth, national wealth,
											whereas they used to be poor, a century ago,
											when there was basically no wealth middle class.
											So this is an important change,
											and it&#39;s interesting to see that wealth inequality
											has not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels,
											although the total quantity of wealth has recovered.
											Okay? So this is the total value
											of wealth relative to income,
											and you can see that in particular in Europe,
											we are almost back to the pre-World War I level.
											So there are really two
											different parts of the story here.
											One has to do with
											the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate,
											and there is nothing bad per se, of course,
											in accumulating a lot of wealth,
											and in particular if it is more diffuse
											and less concentrated.
											So what we really want to focus on
											is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality,
											and what&#39;s going to happen in the future.
											How can we account for the fact that
											until World War I, wealth inequality was so high
											and, if anything, was rising to even higher levels,
											and how can we think about the future?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let me come to some of the explanations
											and speculations about the future.
											Let me first say that
											probably the best model to explain
											why wealth is so much
											more concentrated than income
											is a dynamic, dynastic model
											where individuals have a long horizon
											and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons.
											If people were accumulating wealth
											only for life cycle reasons,
											you know, to be able to consume
											when they are old,
											then the level of wealth inequality
											should be more or less in line
											with the level of income inequality.
											But it will be very difficult to explain
											why you have so much more wealth inequality
											than income inequality
											with a pure life cycle model,
											so you need a story
											where people also care
											about wealth accumulation for other reasons.
											So typically, they want to transmit
											wealth to the next generation, to their children,
											or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth
											because of the prestige, the
power that goes with wealth.
											So there must be other reasons
											for accumulating wealth than just life cycle
											to explain what we see in the data.
											Now, in a large class of dynamic models
											of wealth accumulation
											with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth,
											you will have all sorts of random,
											multiplicative shocks.
											So for instance, some families
											have a very large number of children,
											so the wealth will be divided.
											Some families have fewer children.
											You also have shocks to rates of return.
											Some families make huge capital gains.
											Some made bad investments.
											So you will always have some mobility
											in the wealth process.
											Some people will move up,
some people will move down.
											The important point is that,
											in any such model,
											for a given variance of such shocks,
											the equilibrium level of wealth inequality
											will be a steeply rising function of r minus g.
											And intuitively, the reason why the difference
											between the rate of return to wealth
											and the growth rate is important
											is that initial wealth inequalities
											will be amplified at a faster pace
											with a bigger r minus g.
											So take a simple example,
											with r equals five percent and g equals one percent,
											wealth holders only need to reinvest
											one fifth of their capital income to ensure
											that their wealth rises as fast
											as the size of the economy.
											So this makes it easier
											to build and perpetuate large fortunes
											because you can consume four fifths,
											assuming zero tax,
											and you can just reinvest one fifth.
											So of course some families
will consume more than that,
											some will consume less, so there will be
											some mobility in the distribution,
											but on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth,
											so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, you should not be surprised
											by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever,
											because, in fact, this is what happened
											during most of the history of mankind.
											And this was in a way very obvious to everybody
											for a simple reason, which is that growth
											was close to zero percent
											during most of the history of mankind.
											Growth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent,
											but very slow growth of population
											and output per capita,
											whereas the rate of return on capital
											of course was not zero percent.
											It was, for land assets, which was
											the traditional form
											of assets in preindustrial societies,
											it was typically five percent.
											Any reader of Jane Austen would know that.
											If you want an annual income of 1,000 pounds,
											you should have a capital value
											of 20,000 pounds so that
											five percent of 20,000 is 1,000.
											And in a way, this was
											the very foundation of society,
											because r bigger than g
											was what allowed holders of wealth and assets
											to live off their capital income
											and to do something else in life
											than just to care about their own survival.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, one important conclusion
											of my historical research is that
											modern industrial growth did not change
											this basic fact as much as one might have expected.
											Of course, the growth rate
											following the Industrial Revolution
											rose, typically from zero to one to two percent,
											but at the same time, the rate of return
											to capital also rose
											so that the gap between the two
											did not really change.
											So during the 20th century,
											you had a very unique combination of events.
											First, a very low rate of return
											due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks,
											destruction of wealth, inflation,
											bankruptcy during the Great Depression,
											and all of this reduced
											the private rate of return to wealth
											to unusually low levels
											between 1914 and 1945.
											And then, in the postwar period,
											you had unusually high growth rate,
											partly due to the reconstruction.
											You know, in Germany, in France, in Japan,
											you had five percent growth rate
											between 1950 and 1980
											largely due to reconstruction,
											and also due to very large demographic growth,
											the Baby Boom Cohort effect.
											Now, apparently that&#39;s not going to last for very long,
											or at least the population growth
											is supposed to decline in the future,
											and the best projections we have is that
											the long-run growth is going to be closer
											to one to two percent
											rather than four to five percent.
											So if you look at this,
											these are the best estimates we have
											of world GDP growth
											and rate of return on capital,
											average rates of return on capital,
											so you can see that during most
											of the history of mankind,
											the growth rate was very small,
											much lower than the rate of return,
											and then during the 20th century,
											it is really the population growth,
											very high in the postwar period,
											and the reconstruction process
											that brought growth
											to a smaller gap with the rate of return.
											Here I use the United Nations population projections,
											so of course they are uncertain.
											It could be that we all start
											having a lot of children in the future,
											and the growth rates are going to be higher,
											but from now on,
											these are the best projections we have,
											and this will make global growth
											decline and the gap between
											the rate of return go up.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, the other unusual event
											during the 20th century
											was, as I said,
											destruction, taxation of capital,
											so this is the pre-tax rate of return.
											This is the after-tax rate of return,
											and after destruction,
											and this is what brought
											the average rate of return
											after tax, after destruction,
											below the growth rate during a long time period.
											But without the destruction,
											without the taxation, this 
would not have happened.
											So let me say that the balance between
											returns on capital and growth
											depends on many different factors
											that are very difficult to predict:
											technology and the development
											of capital-intensive techniques.
											So right now, the most capital-intensive sectors
											in the economy are the real estate sector, housing,
											the energy sector, but it could be in the future
											that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors
											and that this would be a bigger share
											of the total capital stock that it is today.
											Well, we are very far from this,
											and from now, what&#39;s going on
											in the real estate sector, the energy sector,
											is much more important for the total capital stock
											and capital share.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The other important issue
											is that there are scale effects
in portfolio management,
											together with financial complexity,
											financial deregulation,
											that make it easier to get higher rates of return
											for a large portfolio,
											and this seems to be particularly strong
											for billionaires, large capital endowments.
											Just to give you one example,
											this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings
											over the 1987-2013 period,
											and you can see the very top wealth holders
											have been going up at six, seven percent per year
											in real terms above inflation,
											whereas average income in the world,
											average wealth in the world,
											have increased at only two percent per year.
											And you find the same
											for large university endowments —
											the bigger the initial endowments,
											the bigger the rate of return.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, what could be done?
											The first thing is that I think we need
											more financial transparency.
											We know too little about global wealth dynamics,
											so we need international transmission
											of bank information.
											We need a global registry of financial assets,
											more coordination on wealth taxation,
											and even wealth tax with a small tax rate
											will be a way to produce information
											so that then we can adapt our policies
											to whatever we observe.
											And to some extent, the fight
											against tax havens
											and automatic transmission of information
											is pushing us in this direction.
											Now, there are other ways to redistribute wealth,
											which it can be tempting to use.
											Inflation:
											it&#39;s much easier to print money
											than to write a tax code, so that&#39;s very tempting,
											but sometimes you don&#39;t know
what you do with the money.
											This is a problem.
											Expropriation is very tempting.
											Just when you feel some people get too wealthy,
											you just expropriate them.
											But this is not a very efficient way
											to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics.
											So war is an even less efficient way,
											so I tend to prefer progressive taxation,
											but of course, history — (Laughter) —
											history will invent its own best ways,
											and it will probably involve
											a combination of all of these.

											Thomas, I want to ask you two or three questions,
											because it&#39;s impressive how you&#39;re
in command of your data, of course,
											but basically what you suggest is
											growing wealth concentration is kind of
											a natural tendency of capitalism,
											and if we leave it to its own devices,
											it may threaten the system itself,
											so you&#39;re suggesting that we need to act
											to implement policies that redistribute wealth,
											including the ones we just saw:
											progressive taxation, etc.
											In the current political context,
											how realistic are those?
											How likely do you think that it is
											that they will be implemented?

									<p>
											Thomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think
											if you look back through time,
											the history of income, wealth and taxation
											is full of surprise.
											So I am not terribly impressed
											by those who know in advance
											what will or will not happen.
											I think one century ago,
											many people would have said
											that progressive income taxation would never happen
											and then it happened.
											And even five years ago,
											many people would have said that bank secrecy
											will be with us forever in Switzerland,
											that Switzerland was too powerful
											for the rest of the world,
											and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions
											against Swiss banks for a big change to happen,
											and now we are moving toward
											more financial transparency.
											So I think it&#39;s not that difficult
											to better coordinate politically.
											We are going to have a treaty
											with half of the world GDP around the table
											with the U.S. and the European Union,
											so if half of the world GDP is not enough
											to make progress on financial transparency
											and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits,
											what does it take?
											So I think these are not technical difficulties.
											I think we can make progress
											if we have a more pragmatic
approach to these questions
											and we have the proper sanctions
											on those who benefit from financial opacity.

											BG: One of the arguments
											against your point of view
											is that economic inequality
											is not only a feature of capitalism
but is actually one of its engines.
											So we take measures to lower inequality,

											TP: Yeah, I think inequality
											is not a problem per se.
											I think inequality up to a point
											can actually be useful for innovation and growth.
											The problem is, it&#39;s a question of degree.
											When inequality gets too extreme,
											then it becomes useless for growth
											and it can even become bad
											because it tends to lead to high perpetuation
											of inequality over time
											and low mobility.
											And for instance, the kind of wealth concentrations
											that we had in the 19th century
											and pretty much until World War I
											in every European country
											was, I think, not useful for growth.
											This was destroyed by a combination
											of tragic events and policy changes,
											and this did not prevent growth from happening.
											And also, extreme inequality can be bad
											for our democratic institutions
											if it creates very unequal access to political voice,
											and the influence of private money
											in U.S. politics, I think,
											is a matter of concern right now.
											So we don&#39;t want to return to that kind of extreme,
											pre-World War I inequality.
											Having a decent share of the national wealth
											for the middle class is not bad for growth.
											It is actually useful
											both for equity and efficiency reasons.

											TP: Well, I answer that I am very happy
											that this book is stimulating debate.
											This is part of what it is intended for.
											Look, the reason why I put all the data online
											with all of the detailed computation
											is so that we can have 
an open and transparent
											debate about this.
											So I have responded point by point
											to every concern.
											Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today,
											I would actually conclude
											that the rise in wealth inequality,
											particularly in the United States,
											has been actually higher
than what I report in my book.
											There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman
											showing, with new data
											which I didn&#39;t have at the time of the book,
											that wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen
											even more than what I report.
											And there will be other data in the future.
											Some of it will go in different directions.
											Look, we put online almost every week
											new, updated series on the
World Top Income Database
											and we will keep doing so in the future,
											in particular in emerging countries,
											and I welcome all of those who want to contribute
											to this data collection process.
											In fact, I certainly agree
											that there is not enough
											transparency about wealth dynamics,
											and a good way to have better data
											would be to have a wealth tax
											with a small tax rate to begin with
											so that we can all agree
											about this important evolution
											and adapt our policies to whatever we observe.
											So taxation is a source of knowledge,
											and that&#39;s what we need the most right now.
