											Okay, so
											90 percent of my photographic process

											It involves a campaign of letter writing,

											And oddly, the most notable

											Photography threatens fantasy.
											They didn&#39;t want to let my camera in

											evidence of a truth.

											Over a five year period following September 11th,
											when the American media and government were seeking
											hidden and unknown sites
											beyond its borders,
											most notably weapons of mass destruction,
											I chose to look inward at that which was integral
											to America&#39;s foundation,
											mythology and daily functioning.
											I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,
											self-imposed and real,
											and confront the divide between privileged
											and public access to knowledge.

											It was a critical moment in American history

											where one felt they didn&#39;t have access to accurate information.
											And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,
											but what I came away with is a photograph.
											And it&#39;s just another place from which to observe,
											and the understanding that
											there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.
											And the outsider can never really reach the core.

											I&#39;m going to run through some of the photographs in this series.
											It&#39;s titled, &quot;An American Index
											of the Hidden and Unfamiliar,&quot;
											and it&#39;s comprised of nearly 70 images.
											In this context I&#39;ll just show you a few.
											This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility
											at Hanford site in Washington State,
											where there are over 1,900
											stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste
											submerged in water.
											A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.
											And I found one section amongst all of these
											that actually resembled the outline

											And a big part of the work that is
											sort of absent in this context is text.
											So I create these two poles.
											Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.
											And what I&#39;m most interested in
											is the invisible space between a text
											and its accompanying image,
											and how the image is transformed by the text
											and the text by the image.
											So, at best, the image is meant to float away
											into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.
											And then the text functions as this cruel anchor
											that kind of nails it to the ground.
											But in this context I&#39;m just going to read
											an abridged version of those texts.

											Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,

Guided by an interest in systems of categorization and classification, her practice involves extensive research into the power and structure of secrecy and the precarious nature of survival. Her works have been the subject of exhibitions at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Copenhagen (2016-17); The Albertinum, Dresden (2016); Galerie Rudolfinum, Prague (2016); Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow (2016); Jeu de Paume, Paris (2015); Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing (2013); Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012); Tate Modern, London (2011); Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (2011); and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2007).&nbsp;</p><p>In<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://geni.us/americanindex\" target=\"_blank\"><em>An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar</em></a>, Simon compiles an inventory of what lies hidden and out-of-view within the borders of the United States. She examines a culture through documentation of subjects from domains including: science, government, medicine, entertainment, nature, security and religion. Confronting the divide between those with and without the privilege of access, her collection reflects and reveals that which is integral to America&rsquo;s foundation, mythology and daily functioning.&nbsp;</p><p><a style=\"font-style: italic\" href=\"http://geni.us/alivingman\" target=\"_blank\">A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters&nbsp;I-XVIII</a><em>&nbsp;</em>was produced over a four-year period (2008&ndash;11) during which Simon traveled around the world researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories. In each of the eighteen &quot;chapters&quot; comprising the work, the external forces of territory, power, circumstance or religion collide with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance. The subjects documented by Simon include victims of genocide in Bosnia, test rabbits infected with a lethal disease in Australia, the first woman to hijack an aircraft, and the living dead in India. Her collection is at once cohesive and arbitrary, mapping the relationships among chance, blood and other components of fate.</p><p>Permanent collections include Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Tate Modern, London; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles. Her work was included in the 56th Venice Biennale (2015).

a historical period in which many people are making such great efforts to conceal the truth from the mass of the people, an artist like Taryn Simon is an invaluable counter-force. Democracy needs visibility, accountability, light ... Somehow, Simon has persuaded a good few denizens of hidden world not to scurry for shelter when the light is switched on, as cockroaches and vampires do, but to pose proudly for her invading lens ...","whotheyare":"With a large-format camera and a knack for talking her way into forbidden zones, Taryn Simon photographs portions of the American infrastructure inaccessible to its inhabitants.","whylisten":"<p>Taryn Simon is a multidisciplinary artist working in photography, text, sculpture and performance. Guided by an interest in systems of categorization and classification, her practice involves extensive research into the power and structure of secrecy and the precarious nature of survival. Her works have been the subject of exhibitions at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Copenhagen (2016-17); The Albertinum, Dresden (2016); Galerie Rudolfinum, Prague (2016); Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow (2016); Jeu de Paume, Paris (2015); Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing (2013); Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012); Tate Modern, London (2011); Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (2011); and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2007).&nbsp;</p><p>In<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://geni.us/americanindex\" target=\"_blank\"><em>An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar</em></a>, Simon compiles an inventory of what lies hidden and out-of-view within the borders of the United States. She examines a culture through documentation of subjects from domains including: science, government, medicine, entertainment, nature, security and religion. Confronting the divide between those with and without the privilege of access, her collection reflects and reveals that which is integral to America&rsquo;s foundation, mythology and daily functioning.&nbsp;</p><p><a style=\"font-style: italic\" href=\"http://geni.us/alivingman\" target=\"_blank\">A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters&nbsp;I-XVIII</a><em>&nbsp;</em>was produced over a four-year period (2008&ndash;11) during which Simon traveled around the world researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories. In each of the eighteen &quot;chapters&quot; comprising the work, the external forces of territory, power, circumstance or religion collide with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance. The subjects documented by Simon include victims of genocide in Bosnia, test rabbits infected with a lethal disease in Australia, the first woman to hijack an aircraft, and the living dead in India. Her collection is at once cohesive and arbitrary, mapping the relationships among chance, blood and other components of fate.</p><p>Permanent collections include Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Tate Modern, London; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles. Her work was included in the 56th Venice Biennale (2015). Simon&#39;s installation, <em>An Occupation of Loss</em> (2016), co-commissioned by the Park Avenue Armory and Artangel, premiered in New York in 2016. The performance will be held again in London in 2018. Simon is a graduate of Brown University and a Guggenheim Fellow. She lives and works in New York.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Taryn Simon","tags":["adventure","art","culture","curiosity","photography"],"title":"Photographs of secret sites","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1640462}]}
