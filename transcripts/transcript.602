											If you are a blind child in India,
											you will very likely have to contend with
											at least two big pieces of bad news.
											The first bad news
											is that the chances of getting treatment
											are extremely slim to none,
											and that&#39;s because most of the blindness
											alleviation programs in the country
											are focused on adults,
											and there are very, very few hospitals
											that are actually equipped to treat children.
											In fact, if you were to be treated,
											you might well end up being treated
											by a person who has no medical credentials
											as this case from Rajasthan illustrates.
											This is a three-year-old orphan girl
											who had cataracts.
											So, her caretakers took her
											to the village medicine man,
											and instead of suggesting to the caretakers
											that the girl be taken to a hospital,
											the person decided to burn her abdomen
											with red-hot iron bars
											to drive out the demons.
											The second piece of bad news
											will be delivered to you
											by neuroscientists, who will tell you
											that if you are older than four or five years of age,
											that even if you have your eye corrected,
											the chances of your brain learning how to see
											are very, very slim —
											again, slim or none.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So when I heard these two things,
											it troubled me deeply,
											both because of personal reasons
											and scientific reasons.
											So let me first start with the personal reason.
											It&#39;ll sound corny, but it&#39;s sincere.
											That&#39;s my son, Darius.
											As a new father,
											I have a qualitatively different sense
											of just how delicate babies are,
											what our obligations are towards them
											and how much love
											we can feel towards a child.
											I would move heaven and earth
											in order to get treatment for Darius,
											and for me to be told
											that there might be other Dariuses
											who are not getting treatment,
											that&#39;s just viscerally wrong.
											So that&#39;s the personal reason.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Scientific reason is that this notion
											from neuroscience of critical periods —
											that if the brain is older
											than four or five years of age,
											it loses its ability to learn —
											that doesn&#39;t sit well with me,
											because I don&#39;t think that idea
											has been tested adequately.
											The birth of the idea is from
											David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel&#39;s work,
											two researchers who were at Harvard,
											and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981
											for their studies of visual physiology,
											which are remarkably beautiful studies,
											but I believe some of their work
											has been extrapolated
											into the human domain prematurely.
											So, they did their work with kittens,
											with different kinds of deprivation regiments,
											and those studies,
											which date back to the &#39;60s,
											are now being applied to human children.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I felt that I needed to do two things.
											One: provide care
											to children who are currently
											being deprived of treatment.
											That&#39;s the humanitarian mission.
											And the scientific mission would be
											to test the limits
											of visual plasticity.
											And these two missions, as you can tell,
											thread together perfectly. One adds to the other;
											in fact, one would be impossible without the other.
											So, to implement
											these twin missions,
											a few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.
											Prakash, as many of you know,
											is the Sanskrit word for light,
											and the idea is that
											in bringing light into the lives of children,
											we also have a chance
											of shedding light on some of the
											deepest mysteries of neuroscience.
											And the logo — even though it looks extremely Irish,
											it&#39;s actually derived from
											the Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.
											The Prakash, the overall effort
											has three components:
											outreach, to identify children in need of care;
											medical treatment; and in subsequent study.
											And I want to show you a short video clip
											that illustrates the first two components of this work.

											Pawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind,
											many children have permanent conditions.
											That&#39;s a case of microphthalmos,
											which is malformed eyes,
											and that&#39;s a permanent condition;
											it cannot be treated.
											That&#39;s an extreme of micropthalmos
											called enophthalmos.
											But, every so often, we come across children
											who show some residual vision,
											and that is a very good sign
											that the condition might actually be treatable.
											So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.
											That&#39;s the hospital we&#39;re working with in Delhi,
											the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.
											It has a very well-equipped
											pediatric ophthalmic center,
											which was made possible in part
											by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.
											So, eating burgers actually helps.

											PS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child,

											The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils
											are congenital cataracts,

											In our eyes, the lens is clear,
											but in this child, the lens has become opaque,
											and therefore he can&#39;t see the world.
											So, the child is given treatment. You&#39;ll see shots of the eye.
											Here&#39;s the eye with the opaque lens,
											the opaque lens extracted

											So, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense
											that recovery is possible,
											and we have now
											provided treatment to over 200 children,
											and the story repeats itself.
											After treatment, the child
											gains significant functionality.
											In fact, the story holds true
											even if you have a person who got sight
											after several years of deprivation.
											We did a paper a few years ago
											about this woman that you see on the right, SRD,
											and she got her sight late in life,
											and her vision is remarkable at this age.
											I should add a tragic postscript to this —
											she died two years ago
											in a bus accident.
											So, hers is just a truly inspiring story —
											unknown, but inspiring story.
											So when we started finding these results,
											as you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir
											in the scientific and the popular press.
											Here&#39;s an article in Nature
											that profiled this work,
											and another one in Time.
											So, we were fairly convinced — we are convinced —
											that recovery is feasible,
											despite extended visual deprivation.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The next obvious question to ask:
											What is the process of recovery?
											So, the way we study that is,
											let&#39;s say we find a child who has light sensitivity.
											The child is provided treatment,
											and I want to stress that the treatment
											is completely unconditional;
											there is no quid pro quo.
											We treat many more children then we actually work with.
											Every child who needs treatment is treated.
											After treatment, about every week,
											we run the child
											on a battery of simple visual tests
											in order to see how their visual skills
											are coming on line.
											And we try to do this for as long as possible.
											This arc of development
											gives us unprecedented
											and extremely valuable information
											about how the scaffolding of vision
											gets set up.
											What might be the causal connections
											between the early developing skills
											and the later developing ones?

									<p>
											And we&#39;ve used this general approach to study
											many different visual proficiencies,
											but I want to highlight one particular one,
											and that is image parsing into objects.
											So, any image of the kind that you see on the left,
											be it a real image or a synthetic image,
											it&#39;s made up of little regions
											that you see in the middle column,
											regions of different colors, different luminances.
											The brain has this complex task
											of putting together, integrating,
											subsets of these regions
											into something that&#39;s more meaningful,
											into what we would consider to be objects,
											as you see on the right.
											And nobody knows how this integration happens,
											and that&#39;s the question we asked with Project Prakash.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, here&#39;s what happens
											very soon after the onset of sight.
											Here&#39;s a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago,
											and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT,
											running the experiment with him.
											His visual-motor coordination is quite poor,
											but you get a general sense
											of what are the regions that he&#39;s trying to trace out.
											If you show him real world images,
											if you show others like him real world images,
											they are unable to recognize most of the objects
											because the world to them is over-fragmented;
											it&#39;s made up of a collage, a patchwork,
											of regions of different colors and luminances.
											And that&#39;s what&#39;s indicated in the green outlines.
											When you ask them,
											&quot;Even if you can&#39;t name the objects, just point to where the objects are,&quot;
											these are the regions that they point to.
											So the world is this complex
											patchwork of regions.
											Even the shadow on the ball
											becomes its own object.
											Interestingly enough,
											you give them a few months,
											and this is what happens.

											PS: And we see this pattern over and over again.

											This simple idea has far reaching implications.
											And let me just quickly mention two,
											one, drawing from the domain of engineering,
											and one from the clinic.
											So, from the perspective of engineering,
											we can ask: Goven that we know
											that motion is so important for the human visual system,
											can we use this as a recipe
											for constructing machine-based vision systems
											that can learn on their own, that don&#39;t need to be programmed
											by a human programmer?
											And that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do.

											I&#39;m at MIT, at MIT you need to apply
											whatever basic knowledge you gain.
											So we are creating Dylan,
											which is a computational system
											with an ambitious goal
											of taking in visual inputs
											of the same kind that a human child would receive,
											and autonomously discovering:
											What are the objects in this visual input?
											So, don&#39;t worry about the internals of Dylan.
											Here, I&#39;m just going to talk about
											how we test Dylan.
											The way we test Dylan is by giving it
											inputs, as I said, of the same kind
											that a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.
											But for a long time we couldn&#39;t quite figure out:
											Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs?
											So, I thought,
											could we have Darius
											serve as our babycam carrier,
											and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?
											So that&#39;s what we did.
											(Laughter)
											I had to have long conversations with my wife.

											So, we modified the optics of the camera
											in order to mimic the baby&#39;s visual acuity.
											As some of you might know,
											babyies are born pretty much legally blind.
											Their acuity — our acuity is 20/20;
											babies&#39; acuity is like 20/800,
											so they are looking at the world
											in a very, very blurry fashion.
											Here&#39;s what a baby-cam video looks like.

											Thankfully, there isn&#39;t any audio
											to go with this.
											What&#39;s amazing is that working with such
											highly degraded input,
											the baby, very quickly, is able
											to discover meaning in such input.
											But then two or three days afterward,
											babies begin to pay attention
											to their mother&#39;s or their father&#39;s face.
											How does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that,
											and using this mantra of motion,
											Dylan actually can do that.
											So, given that kind of video input,
											with just about six or seven minutes worth of video,
											Dylan can begin to extract patterns
											that include faces.
											So, it&#39;s an important demonstration
											of the power of motion.

											The clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.
											Visual integration has been associated with autism
											by several researchers.
											When we saw that, we asked:
											Could the impairment in visual integration
											be the manifestation of something underneath,
											of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?
											Because, if that hypothesis were to be true,
											it would have massive repercussions in our understanding
											of what&#39;s causing the many different aspects

											What you&#39;re going to see are
											video clips of two children — one neurotypical,
											one with autism, playing Pong.
											So, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they&#39;re looking.
											In red are the eye movement traces.
											This is the neurotypical child, and what you see
											is that the child is able to make cues
											of the dynamic information
											to predict where the ball is going to go.
											Even before the ball gets to a place,
											the child is already looking there.
											Contrast this with a child
											with autism playing the same game.
											Instead of anticipating,
											the child always follows where the ball has been.
											The efficiency of the use
											of dynamic information
											seems to be significantly compromised in autism.
											So we are pursuing this line of work
											and hopefully we&#39;ll have
											more results to report soon.

To do this, they often use computers to model the processes of the human brain, but they also study human subjects, some of whom are seeing the world for the very first time and can tell them about the experience as it happens. They find these unusual subjects through the humanitarian branch of their research, Project Prakash. </p><p>Project Prakash sets up eye-care camps in some of the most habitually underserved regions of India, and gives free eye-health screenings to, since 2003, more than 700 functionally blind children. The children are then treated without charge, even if they do not fit the profile that would make them eligible for Sinha&#39;s research. </p><p>Sinha&#39;s eventual goal is to help 500 children each year; plans are under way for a center for visual rehabilitation in new Delhi. The special relationship that Sinha has created between research and humanitarianism promises to deliver on both fronts.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Pawan Sinha","tags":["biology","health care","medicine","science","sight","neuroscience","india"],"title":"How brains learn to see","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":860710}]}
