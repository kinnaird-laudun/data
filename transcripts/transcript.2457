<title>Susan Pinker: The secret to living longer may be your social life | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The Italian island of Sardinia has more than six times as many centenarians as the mainland and ten times as many as North America. Why? According to psychologist Susan Pinker, it&#39;s not a sunny disposition or a low-fat, gluten-free diet that keeps the islanders healthy -- it&#39;s their emphasis on close personal relationships and face-to-face interactions. Learn more about super longevity as Pinker explains what it takes to live to 100 and beyond." />

<meta content="The Italian island of Sardinia has more than six times as many centenarians as the mainland and ten times as many as North America. Why? According to psychologist Susan Pinker, it's not a sunny disposition or a low-fat, gluten-free diet that keeps the islanders healthy — it's their emphasis on close personal relationships and face-to-face interactions.

											Here&#39;s an intriguing fact.
											In the developed world,
											everywhere, women live an average
of six to eight years longer than men do.
											Six to eight years longer.
											That&#39;s, like, a huge gap.
											In 2015, the &quot;Lancet&quot; published an article
											showing that men in rich countries
											are twice as likely to die as women are
											at any age.

									<p>
											But there is one place in the world
											where men live as long as women.
											It&#39;s a remote, mountainous zone,
											a blue zone,
											where super longevity
											is common to both sexes.
											This is the blue zone in Sardinia,
											an Italian island in the Mediterranean,
											between Corsica and Tunisia,
											where there are six times
as many centenarians
											as on the Italian mainland,
											less than 200 miles away.
											There are 10 times as many centenarians
											as there are in North America.
											It&#39;s the only place
where men live as long as women.

											But why?
											My curiosity was piqued.
											I decided to research the science
and the habits of the place,
											and I started with the genetic profile.
											I discovered soon enough
											that genes account for just
25 percent of their longevity.
											The other 75 percent is lifestyle.

											So what does it take
to live to 100 or beyond?
											What are they doing right?
											What you&#39;re looking at
is an aerial view of Villagrande.
											It&#39;s a village at the epicenter
of the blue zone
											where I went to investigate this,
											and as you can see, architectural beauty
is not its main virtue,
											density is:
											tightly spaced houses,
											interwoven alleys and streets.
											It means that the villagers&#39; lives
constantly intersect.
											And as I walked through the village,
											I could feel hundreds
of pairs of eyes watching me
											from behind doorways and curtains,
											from behind shutters.
											Because like all ancient villages,
											Villagrande couldn&#39;t have survived
											without this structure,
without its walls, without its cathedral,
											without its village square,
											because defense and social cohesion
defined its design.

											Meet Giuseppe Murinu.
He&#39;s 102, a supercentenarian
											and a lifelong resident
of the village of Villagrande.
											He was a gregarious man.
											He loved to recount stories
											such as how he lived like a bird
											from what he could find
on the forest floor
											during not one but two world wars,
											how he and his wife,
who also lived past 100,
											raised six children
in a small, homey kitchen
											where I interviewed him.
											Here he is with his sons
Angelo and Domenico,
											both in their 70s

											But Giuseppe, he wasn&#39;t suspicious at all.
											He was a happy-go-lucky guy,
											very outgoing with a positive outlook.
											And I wondered: so is that what it takes
to live to be 100 or beyond,
											thinking positively?

											But despite being a sourpuss,
											the niece who lived with him
and looked after him
											called him &quot;Il Tesoro,&quot; &quot;my treasure.&quot;

											Now, so far we&#39;ve only met men,
											long-living men, but I met women too,
											and here you see Zia Teresa.
											She, at over 100, taught me
how to make the local specialty,

											Now, these centenarians&#39; stories
along with the science that underpins them
											prompted me to ask myself
some questions too,
											such as, when am I going to die
and how can I put that day off?
											And as you will see,
the answer is not what we expect.
											Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher
at Brigham Young University
											and she addressed this very question
											in a series of studies
											of tens of thousands of middle aged people
											much like this audience here.
											And she looked at every
aspect of their lifestyle:
											their diet, their exercise,
											their marital status,
											how often they went to the doctor,
											whether they smoked or drank, etc.
											She recorded all of this
											and then she and her colleagues
sat tight and waited for seven years
											to see who would still be breathing.
											And of the people left standing,
											what reduced their chances
of dying the most?
											That was her question.

											So let&#39;s now look at her data in summary,
											going from the least powerful
predictor to the strongest.
											OK?
											So clean air, which is great,
											it doesn&#39;t predict how long you will live.
											Whether you have your hypertension treated
											is good.
											Still not a strong predictor.
											Whether you&#39;re lean or overweight,
you can stop feeling guilty about this,
											because it&#39;s only in third place.
											How much exercise you get is next,
											still only a moderate predictor.
											Whether you&#39;ve had a cardiac event
and you&#39;re in rehab and exercising,
											getting higher now.
											Whether you&#39;ve had a flu vaccine.
											Did anybody here know
											that having a flu vaccine
protects you more than doing exercise?
											Whether you were drinking and quit,
											or whether you&#39;re a moderate drinker,
											whether you don&#39;t smoke,
or if you did, whether you quit,
											and getting towards the top predictors
											are two features of your social life.
											First, your close relationships.
											These are the people
that you can call on for a loan
											if you need money suddenly,
											who will call the doctor
if you&#39;re not feeling well
											or who will take you to the hospital,
											or who will sit with you
if you&#39;re having an existential crisis,
											if you&#39;re in despair.
											Those people, that little clutch of people
											are a strong predictor, if you have them,
of how long you&#39;ll live.
											And then something that surprised me,
											something that&#39;s called
social integration.
											This means how much
you interact with people
											as you move through your day.
											How many people do you talk to?
											And these mean both
your weak and your strong bonds,
											so not just the people
you&#39;re really close to,
											who mean a lot to you,
											but, like, do you talk to the guy
who every day makes you your coffee?
											Do you talk to the postman?
											Do you talk to the woman who walks
by your house every day with her dog?
											Do you play bridge or poker,
have a book club?
											Those interactions
are one of the strongest predictors
											of how long you&#39;ll live.

											Now, this leads me to the next question:
											if we now spend more time online
than on any other activity,
											including sleeping,
											we&#39;re now up to 11 hours a day,
											one hour more than last year, by the way,
											does it make a difference?
											Why distinguish
between interacting in person
											and interacting via social media?
											Is it the same thing as being there
											if you&#39;re in contact constantly
with your kids through text, for example?
											Well, the short answer
to the question is no,
											it&#39;s not the same thing.
											Face-to-face contact releases
a whole cascade of neurotransmitters,
											and like a vaccine,
they protect you now in the present
											and well into the future.
											So simply making
eye contact with somebody,
											shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five
											is enough to release oxytocin,
											which increases your level of trust
											and it lowers your cortisol levels.
											So it lowers your stress.
											And dopamine is generated,
which gives us a little high
											and it kills pain.
											It&#39;s like a naturally produced morphine.

									<p>
											Now, all of this passes
under our conscious radar,
											which is why we conflate
online activity with the real thing.
											But we do have evidence now,
fresh evidence,
											that there is a difference.
											So let&#39;s look at some of the neuroscience.
											Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist
at the University of Maryland,
											tried to map the difference
											between what goes on in our brains
when we interact in person
											versus when we&#39;re watching
something that&#39;s static.
											And what she did was
she compared the brain function
											of two groups of people,
											those interacting live with her
											or with one of her research associates
											in a dynamic conversation,
											and she compared that
to the brain activity of people
											who were watching her talk
about the same subject
											but in a canned video, like on YouTube.
											And by the way, if you want to know
											how she fit two people
in an MRI scanner at the same time,
											talk to me later.

									<p>
											So what&#39;s the difference?
											This is your brain
on real social interaction.
											What you&#39;re seeing
is the difference in brain activity
											between interacting in person
and taking in static content.
											In orange, you see the brain areas
that are associated with attention,
											social intelligence —
											that means anticipating
what somebody else is thinking
											and feeling and planning —
											and emotional reward.
											And these areas become much more engaged
											when we&#39;re interacting
with a live partner.

											Now, these richer brain signatures
											might be why recruiters
from Fortune 500 companies
											evaluating candidates
											thought that the candidates were smarter
											when they heard their voices
											compared to when they just
read their pitches in a text, for example,
											or an email or a letter.
											Now, our voices and body language
convey a rich signal.
											It shows that we&#39;re thinking, feeling,
											sentient human beings
											who are much more than an algorithm.
											Now, this research by Nicholas Epley
											at the University of Chicago
Business School
											is quite amazing because
it tells us a simple thing.
											If somebody hears your voice,
											they think you&#39;re smarter.
											I mean, that&#39;s quite a simple thing.

											Now, to return to the beginning,
											why do women live longer than men?
											And one major reason
is that women are more likely
											to prioritize and groom
their face-to-face relationships
											over their lifespans.
											Fresh evidence shows
											that these in-person friendships
											create a biological force field
against disease and decline.
											And it&#39;s not just true of humans
											but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well.
											Anthropologist Joan Silk&#39;s work
shows that female baboons
											who have a core of female friends
											show lower levels of stress
via their cortisol levels,
											they live longer and they have
more surviving offspring.
											At least three stable relationships.
											That was the magic number.
											Think about it.
											I hope you guys have three.

											Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
I have a question for you.
											I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a middle path.
											So you talk about the neurotransmitters
connecting when in face-to-face,
											but what about digital technology?
											We&#39;ve seen enormous improvements
in digital technology
											like FaceTime, things like that.
											Does that work too?
											I mean, I see my nephew.
											He plays Minecraft
and he&#39;s yelling at his friends.

											Susan Pinker: Some of the data
are just emerging.
											The data are so fresh
that the digital revolution happened
											and the health data trailed behind.
											So we&#39;re just learning,
											but I would say
there are some improvements
											that we could make in the technology.
											For example, the camera on your laptop
is at the top of the screen,
											so for example, when you&#39;re
looking into the screen,
											you&#39;re not actually making eye contact.
											So something as simple
as even just looking into the camera
											can increase those neurotransmitters,
											or maybe changing
the position of the camera.
											So it&#39;s not identical, but I think
we are getting closer with the technology.
