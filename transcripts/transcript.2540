<title>Victoria Pratt: How judges can show respect | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In halls of justice around the world, how can we ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect? A pioneering judge in New Jersey, Victoria Pratt shares her principles of &quot;procedural justice&quot; -- four simple, thoughtful steps that redefined the everyday business of her courtroom in Newark, changing lives along the way. &quot;When the court behaves differently, naturally people respond differently,&quot; Pratt says. &quot;We want people to enter our halls of justice ... and know that justice will be served there.&quot;" />

<meta content='How judges can show respect' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='In halls of justice around the world, how can we ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect? A pioneering judge in New Jersey, Victoria Pratt shares her principles of "procedural justice" — four simple, thoughtful steps that redefined the everyday business of her courtroom in Newark, changing lives along the way. "When the court behaves differently, naturally people respond differently," Pratt says. "We want people to enter our halls of justice ... and know that justice will be served there."' itemprop='description'>

to the Newark Municipal Court bench.
											And because I was dragged

											Every day across America

that is foreign, intimidating

											Let me paint a picture for you

											First, they&#39;re annoyed as they&#39;re probed

											They finally get through court security,
they walk around the building,
											they ask different people
the same question
											and get different answers.
											When they finally get
to where they&#39;re supposed to be,

											What would you think if I told you
											that you could improve
people&#39;s court experience,
											increase their compliance with the law
											and court orders,
											all the while increasing
the public&#39;s trust
											in the justice system
											with a simple idea?
											Well, that simple idea
is procedural justice
											and it&#39;s a concept that says
											that if people perceive
they are treated fairly
											and with dignity and respect,
											they&#39;ll obey the law.
											Well, that&#39;s what
Yale professor Tom Tyler found
											when he began to study
as far back in the &#39;70s
											why people obey the law.
											He found that if people
see the justice system
											as a legitimate authority
to impose rules and regulations,
											they would follow them.
											His research concluded
											that people would be satisfied
											with the judge&#39;s rulings,
											even when the judge ruled against them,
											if they perceived
that they were treated fairly
											and with dignity and respect.
											And that perception of fairness
begins with what?
											Begins with how judges speak
to court participants.

											The next principle is neutrality.
											When increasing public trust
in the justice system,
											neutrality is paramount.
											The judge cannot be perceived
to be favoring one side over the other.
											The judge has to make a conscious decision
not to say things like,
											&quot;my officer,&quot; &quot;my prosecutor,&quot;
&quot;my defense attorney.&quot;
											And this is challenging
when we work in environments
											where you have people
assigned to your courts,
											the same people coming
in and out of your courts as well.
											When I think of neutrality,
											I&#39;m reminded of when I was
a new Rutgers Law grad
											and freshly minted attorney,
											and I entered an arbitration
and I was greeted by two grey-haired men
											who were joking about
the last game of golf they played together
											and planning future social outings.

											The last principle is respect,
											that without it none
of the other principles can work.
											Now, respect can be as simple as,
											&quot;Good afternoon, sir.&quot;
&quot;Good morning, ma&#39;am.&quot;
											It&#39;s looking the person in the eye
who is standing before you,
											especially when you&#39;re sentencing them.
											It&#39;s when I say,
&quot;Um, how are you doing today?
											And what&#39;s going on with you?&quot;
											And not as a greeting,
											but as someone who is
actually interested in the response.
											Respect is the difference between saying,
											&quot;Ma&#39;am, are you having difficulty
											understanding the information
in the paperwork?&quot;
											versus, &quot;You can
read and write, can&#39;t you?&quot;
											when you&#39;ve realized
there&#39;s a literacy issue.
											And the good thing about respect
is that it&#39;s contagious.
											People see you being
respectful to other folks
											and they impute
that respect to themselves.
											You see, that&#39;s what
the transgender prostitute was telling me.
											I&#39;m judging you just as much

											Fortunately, the City of Newark
decided that Newarkers deserved better,

											The only problem is
that this wonderful program
											was now coming to Newark
and was going to be housed where?
											Part Two criminal courtroom.
											And the attitudes there were terrible.
											And the reason that
the attitudes were terrible there
											was because everyone who was sent there
											understood they were
being sent there as punishment.
											The officers who were facing
disciplinary actions at times,
											the public defender and prosecutor
											felt like they were doing
a 30-day jail sentence on their rotation,

											But the reality is that as a society,
we criminalize social ills,
											then sent people to a judge
and say, &quot;Do something.&quot;
											I decided that I was going
to lead by example.
											So my first foray into the approach
came when a 60-something-year-old man
											appeared before me handcuffed.
											His head was lowered and his body
was showing the signs of drug withdrawal.
											I asked him how long he had been addicted,
and he said, &quot;30 years.&quot;
											And I asked him, &quot;Do you have any kids?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;Yeah,
I have a 32-year-old son.&quot;
											And I said, &quot;Oh, so you&#39;ve never
had the opportunity
											to be a father to your son
because of your addiction.&quot;
											He began to cry.
											I said, &quot;You know what,
I&#39;m going to let you go home,
											and you&#39;ll come back in two weeks,
											and when you come back, we&#39;ll give you
some assistance for your addiction.&quot;
											Surprisingly, two weeks passed
and he was sitting the courtroom.
											When he came up, he said,
&quot;Judge, I came back to court
											because you showed me more love
than I had for myself.&quot;
											And I thought, my God,
he heard love from the bench?
											I could do this all day.

											and before you sent me there
to do community service,
											I had never gone to the park
