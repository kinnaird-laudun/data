											As it turns out, when tens of millions
of people are unemployed
											or underemployed,
											there&#39;s a fair amount of interest
in what technology might be doing
											to the labor force.
											And as I look at the conversation,
											it strikes me that it&#39;s focused
on exactly the right topic,
											and at the same time,
it&#39;s missing the point entirely.
											The topic that it&#39;s focused on,
											the question is whether or not all these
digital technologies are affecting
											people&#39;s ability to earn a living,
											or, to say it a little bit different way,
											are the droids taking our jobs?
											And there&#39;s some evidence that they are.

											The Great Recession ended
when American GDP resumed
											its kind of slow, steady march upward,
											and some other economic indicators
also started to rebound,
											and they got kind of healthy
kind of quickly.
											Corporate profits are quite high;
											in fact, if you include bank profits,
											they&#39;re higher than they&#39;ve ever been.
											And business investment
in gear — in equipment
											and hardware and software —
is at an all-time high.
											So the businesses are getting
out their checkbooks.
											What they&#39;re not really doing is hiring.
											So this red line
											is the employment-to-population ratio,
											in other words, the percentage
of working-age people in America
											who have work.
											And we see that it cratered
during the Great Recession,
											and it hasn&#39;t started
to bounce back at all.

											But the story is not
just a recession story.
											The decade that we&#39;ve
just been through had
											relatively anemic job growth
all throughout,
											especially when we compare it
to other decades,
											and the 2000s are the only time
we have on record
											where there were fewer people working
at the end of the decade
											than at the beginning.
											This is not what you want to see.
											When you graph the number
of potential employees
											versus the number of jobs in the country,
											you see the gap gets bigger
and bigger over time,
											and then, during the Great Recession,
it opened up in a huge way.

											I did some quick calculations.
											I took the last 20 years of GDP growth
											and the last 20 years
of labor-productivity growth
											and used those in a fairly
straightforward way
											to try to project how many jobs
the economy was going to need
											to keep growing,
											and this is the line that I came up with.
											Is that good or bad?
											This is the government&#39;s projection
											for the working-age
population going forward.
											So if these predictions are accurate,
that gap is not going to close.

											The problem is, I don&#39;t think
these projections are accurate.
											In particular, I think my projection
is way too optimistic,
											because when I did it,
											I was assuming that the future
was kind of going to look like the past,
											with labor productivity growth,
											and that&#39;s actually not what I believe.
											Because when I look around,
											I think that we ain&#39;t seen nothing yet

impact on the labor force.

											Throughout all of history,
											if you wanted something translated
from one language into another,

											Now we have multi-language, instantaneous,

											A lot of people look at this and they say,
											&quot;OK, but those are very
specific, narrow tasks,
											and most knowledge workers
are actually generalists.
											And what they do is sit on top of a very
large body of expertise and knowledge
											and they use that to react on the fly
to kind of unpredictable demands,
											and that&#39;s very, very hard to automate.&quot;
											One of the most impressive
knowledge workers in recent memory
											is a guy named Ken Jennings.
											He won the quiz show
&quot;Jeopardy!&quot; 74 times in a row.
											Took home three million dollars.
											That&#39;s Ken on the right,
getting beat three-to-one
											by Watson, the Jeopardy-playing
supercomputer from IBM.
											So when we look at what technology can do
to general knowledge workers,
											I start to think there might not be
something so special
											about this idea of a generalist,
											particularly when we start doing things
like hooking Siri up to Watson,
											and having technologies
that can understand what we&#39;re saying
											and repeat speech back to us.

											Now, Siri is far from perfect,
and we can make fun of her flaws,
											but we should also keep in mind
											that if technologies like Siri and Watson
improve along a Moore&#39;s law trajectory,
											which they will,
											in six years, they&#39;re not going to be two
times better or four times better,
											they&#39;ll be 16 times better
than they are right now.
											So I start to think a lot of knowledge
work is going to be affected by this.

the stop-and-go traffic on US 101
											very smoothly.
											There are about three and a half million
people who drive trucks for a living
											in the United States;
											I think some of them are going
to be affected by this technology.
											And right now, humanoid robots
are still incredibly primitive.
											They can&#39;t do very much.

are coming for our jobs.
											In the short term, we can
stimulate job growth

											Now, I want to share some
of the answers that I&#39;ve gotten
											in response to this question.
											It&#39;s a wonderful question to ask
and start an endless debate about,
											because some people are going to bring up
											systems of philosophy
in both the West and the East
											that have changed how a lot
of people think about the world.
											And then other people will say,
											&quot;No, actually, the big stories,
the big developments
											are the founding
of the world&#39;s major religions,
											which have changed civilizations
and have changed and influenced
											how countless people
are living their lives.&quot;
											And then some other folk will say,
											&quot;Actually, what changes civilizations,
											what modifies them and what changes
people&#39;s lives are empires,
											so the great developments in human history
											are stories of conquest and of war.&quot;
											And then some cheery soul
usually always pipes up and says,
											&quot;Hey, don&#39;t forget about plagues!&quot;

									<p>
											There are some optimistic
answers to this question,
											so some people will bring up
the Age of Exploration
											and the opening up of the world.
											Others will talk about intellectual
achievements in disciplines like math
											that have helped us get
a better handle on the world,
											and other folk will talk about periods
when there was a deep flourishing
											of the arts and sciences.
											So this debate will go on and on.
											It&#39;s an endless debate
											and there&#39;s no conclusive,
single answer to it.
											But if you&#39;re a geek like me,
											you say, &quot;Well, what do the data say?&quot;
											And you start to do things
											like graph things
that we might be interested in —
											the total worldwide
population, for example,
											or some measure of social development
											or the state of advancement of a society.
											And you start to plot the data,
because, by this approach,
											the big stories, the big
developments in human history,
											are the ones that will bend
these curves a lot.

											The steam engine and the other

											changed the world and influenced
human history so much,

of the historian Ian Morris,

that had come before.&quot;
											And they did this by infinitely
multiplying the power of our muscles,
											overcoming the limitations of our muscles.
											Now, what we&#39;re in the middle of now
											is overcoming the limitations
of our individual brains

											Economies don&#39;t run on energy.

the work of coming up with new ideas,

											I hear once in a while,
&quot;OK, I&#39;ll grant you that,
											but technology is still a tool
for the rich world,
											and what&#39;s not happening,
											these digital tools are not
improving the lives
											of people at the bottom of the pyramid.&quot;
											And I want to say to that
very clearly: nonsense.
											The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting
hugely from technology.
											The economist Robert Jensen
did this wonderful study a while back
											where he watched, in great detail,
											what happened to the fishing
villages of Kerala, India,
											when they got mobile phones
for the very first time.
											And when you write for the Quarterly
Journal of Economics,
											you have to use very dry
and very circumspect language.
											But when I read his paper,
											I kind of feel Jensen
is trying to scream at us
											and say, &quot;Look, this was a big deal.
											Prices stabilized, so people
could plan their economic lives.
											Waste was not reduced —
it was eliminated.
											And the lives of both
the buyers and the sellers
											in these villages measurably improved.&quot;

									<p>
											Now, what I don&#39;t think
is that Jensen got extremely lucky
											and happened to land
in the one set of villages
											where technology made things better.
											What happened instead
is he very carefully documented
											what happens over and over again
when technology comes for the first time
											to an environment and a community:
											the lives of people, the welfares
of people, improve dramatically.

											So as I look around at all the evidence
											and I think about the room
that we have ahead of us,
											I become a huge digital optimist
											and I start to think that this wonderful
statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson
											is actually not hyperbole.
											This is an accurate assessment
of what&#39;s going on.
											Our technologies are great gifts,
											and we, right now,
have the great good fortune
											to be living at a time when
digital technology is flourishing,
											when it is broadening and deepening

											So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,

I am very confident,

that what we&#39;re going to do
											with our new digital tools
											is going to be so profound
and so beneficial
											that it&#39;s going to make a mockery
