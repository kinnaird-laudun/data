											Today I&#39;m going to take you on a voyage
											to some place so deep,
											so dark, so unexplored
											that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.
											It&#39;s a place of myth and legend.
											It&#39;s a place marked on ancient maps
											as &quot;here be monsters.&quot;
											It is a place where each new voyage of exploration
											brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange
											that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.
											Instead, they just make me green with envy
											that my colleague from IUCN
											was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts
											to actually take photographs
											and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.

											We are talking about the high seas.
											The &quot;high seas&quot; is a legal term,
											but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.
											With an average depth of the oceans
											of 4,000 meters,
											in fact, the high seas covers and provides
											nearly 90 percent of the habitat
											for life on this Earth.
											It is, in theory, the global commons,
											belonging to us all.
											But in reality,
											it is managed by and for
											those who have the resources
											to go out and exploit it.
											So today I&#39;m going to take you on a voyage
											to cast light on some of the outdated myths
											and legends and assumptions
											that have kept us as the true stakeholders
											in the high seas in the dark.
											We&#39;re going to voyage to some of these special places
											that we&#39;ve been discovering in the past few years
											to show why we really need to care.
											And then finally, we&#39;re going to try
											to develop and pioneer a new perspective
											on high seas governance
											that&#39;s rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation,
											but framed in an arena of global norms
											of precaution and respect.

											So here is a picture of the high seas
											as seen from above —
											that area in the darker blue.
											To me, as an international lawyer,
											this scared me far more
											than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,
											for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean,
											the global ocean,
											that provides us all with carbon storage,
											with heat storage, with oxygen,
											if you can only protect 36 percent.
											This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
											Some of the problems that we have to confront
											are that the current international laws —
											for example, shipping —
											provide more protection
											to the areas closest to shore.
											For example, garbage discharge,
											something you would think just simply goes away,
											but the laws regulating
											ship discharge of garbage
											actually get weaker the further you are from shore.
											As a result, we have garbage patches
											the size of twice-Texas.
											It&#39;s unbelievable.
											We used to think the solution to pollution
											was dilution,
											but that has proved to be no longer the case.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what we have learned from social scientists
											and economists like Elinor Ostrom,
											who are studying the phenomenon
											of management of the commons on a local scale,
											is that there are certain prerequisites
											that you can put into place
											that enable you to manage
											and access open space
											for the good of one and all.
											And these include a sense of shared responsibility,
											common norms that bind people together as a community.
											Conditional access: You can invite people in,
											but they have to be able to play by the rules.
											And of course, if you want people to play by the rules,
											you still need an effective system
											of monitoring and enforcement,
											for as we&#39;ve discovered,
											you can trust, but you also need to verify.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What I&#39;d also like to convey
											is that it is not all doom and gloom
											that we are seeing in the high seas.
											For a group of very dedicated individuals —
											scientists, conservationists,
											photographers and states —
											were able to actually change a tragic trajectory
											that was destroying fragile seascapes
											such as this coral garden
											that you see in front of you.
											That is, we&#39;re able to save it from a fate
											of deep-sea bottom trawling.
											And how did we do that?
											Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships
											and actually photographed the activities in process.
											But we also spent many hours
											in the basements of the United Nations,
											trying to work with governments to make them understand
											what was going on so far away from land
											that few of us had ever even imagined
											that these creatures existed.

									<p>
											So within three years,
											from 2003 to 2006,
											we were able to get norm in place
											that actually changed the paradigm
											of how fishers went about
											deep-sea bottom trawling.
											Instead of &quot;go anywhere, do anything you want,&quot;
											we actually created a regime
											that required prior assessment of where you&#39;re going
											and a duty to prevent significant harm.
											In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,
											they discovered
											that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed
											had been protected.
											This does not mean that it&#39;s the final solution,
											or that this even provides permanent protection.
											But what it does mean
											is that a group of individuals can form a community
											to actually shape
											the way high seas are governed,
											to create a new regime.
											So I&#39;m looking optimistically at our opportunities
											for creating a true, blue perspective
											for this beautiful planet.
											Sylvia&#39;s wish
											provides us with that leverage, that access
											to the heart of human beings,
											you might say,
											who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,
											but are now hopefully going to become interested
											in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,
											who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.

											Today, we&#39;re just going to voyage to a small sampling
											of some of these special areas,
											just to give you an idea of the flavor
											of the riches and wonders they do contain.
											The Sargasso Sea, for example,
											is not a sea bounded by coastlines,
											but it is bounded by oceanic currents
											that contain and envelope
											this wealth of sargassum
											that grows and aggregates there.
											It&#39;s also known as the spawning ground for eels
											from Northern European
											and Northern American rivers
											that are now so dwindling in numbers
											that they&#39;ve actually stopped showing up in Stockholm,
											and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.

											But the Sargasso Sea,
											the same way it aggregates sargassum weed,
											actually is pulling in the plastic
											from throughout the region.
											This picture doesn&#39;t exactly show
											the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven&#39;t been out there myself.
											But there has just been a study
											that was released in February
											that showed there are 200,000
											pieces of plastic per square-kilometer
											now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,
											and that is affecting the habitat
											for the many species in their juvenile stages
											who come to the Sargasso Sea
											for its protection and its food.
											The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place
											for the aggregation of these unique species
											that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.
											It also provides a special habitat
											for these flying fish to lay their eggs.
											But what I&#39;d like to get from this picture
											is that we truly do have an opportunity
											to launch a global initiative for protection.
											Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need
											and its responsibility
											as having some of the Sargasso Sea
											within its national jurisdiction —
											but the vast majority is beyond —
											to help spearhead a movement
											to achieve protection for this vital area.

											Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now:
											the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.
											It&#39;s actually a bay.
											It&#39;s considered high seas, because the continent
											has been put off limits
											to territorial claims.
											So anything in the water is treated as if it&#39;s the high seas.
											But what makes the Ross Sea important
											is the vast sea of pack ice
											that in the spring and summer
											provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill
											that supports what, till recently,
											has been a virtually intact
											near-shore ecosystem.
											But unfortunately, CCAMLR,
											the regional commission
											in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks
											and other living marine resources,
											is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests
											and has authorized the expansion
											of toothfish fisheries in the region.
											The captain of a New Zealand vessel
											who was just down there
											is reporting a significant decline
											in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,
											who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish
											as their main source of food.
											So what we need to do is to stand up boldly,
											singly and together,
											to push governments,
											to push regional fisheries management organizations,
											to declare our right
											to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,
											so that the freedom to fish no longer means
											the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.

											Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome
											is a recently discovered area —
											potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.
											There&#39;s enough food there to last them
											the summer and the winter long.
											But what&#39;s unusual about the Costa Rica Dome
											is, in fact, it&#39;s not a permanent place.
											It&#39;s an oceanographic phenomenon
											that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.
											So, in fact, it&#39;s not permanently in the high seas.
											It&#39;s not permanently in the exclusive economic zones
											of these five Central American countries,
											but it moves with the season.
											As such, it does create a challenge to protect,
											but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
											We can use the same technologies that fishers use
											to identify where the species are,
											in order to close the area
											when it&#39;s most vulnerable,
											which may, in some cases, be year-round.

											Getting closer to shore, where we are,
											this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.
											Many species are headed through this region,
											which is why there&#39;s been so much attention
											put into conservation
											of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
											This is the initiative that&#39;s been coordinated
											by Conservation International
											with a variety of partners and governments
											to actually try to bring integrated management regime
											throughout the area.
											That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go
											with a real regional initiative.
											It&#39;s protecting five World Heritage sites.
											Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention
											does not recognize the need to protect areas
											beyond national jurisdiction, at present.
											So a place like the Costa Rica Dome
											could not technically qualify
											the time it&#39;s in the high seas.
											So what we&#39;ve been suggesting
											is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,
											so that it can adopt
											and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,
											or we need to change the name
											and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.
											But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles
											do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
											These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,
											where they spend most of their time
											and often end up getting hooked like this,
											or as bycatch.

											So what I&#39;d really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.
											We need to work locally,
											but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.
											We have the tools and technologies now
											to enable us to take a broader
											ocean-basin-wide initiative.
											We&#39;ve heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,
											one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.
											It&#39;s provided us data like this,
											of tiny, little sooty shearwaters
											that make the entire ocean basin their home.
											They fly 65,000 kilometers
											in less than a year.
											So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.
											And its culminating year
											that&#39;s going to be launched in October.
											So stay tuned for further information.
											What I find so exciting
											is that the Census of Marine Life
											has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;
											it&#39;s also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,
											where creatures like this flying sea cucumber
											have been found.
											And fortunately, we&#39;ve been able, as IUCN,
											to team up with the Census of Marine Life
											and many of the scientists working there
											to actually try to translate
											much of this information to policymakers.
											We have the support of governments now behind us.
											We&#39;ve been revealing this information through technical workshops.
											And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information
											to move ahead to protect some of these
											significant hope spots, hotspots.
											At the same time we&#39;re saying,
											&quot;Yes, we need more. We need to move forward.&quot;

											But many of you have said,
											if you get these marine protected areas,
											or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place,
											how are you going to enforce it?
											Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science,
											which is outer space technology.
											I wanted to be an astronaut,
											so I&#39;ve constantly followed
											what are the tools available to monitor Earth
											from outer space —
											and that we have incredible tools like we&#39;ve been learning about,
											in terms of being able to follow tagged species
											throughout their life-cycles
											in the open ocean.
											We can also tag and track fishing vessels.
											Many already have transponders on board
											that allow us to find out where they are and even what they&#39;re doing.
											But not all the vessels have those to date.
											It does not take too much rocket science
											to actually try to create new laws to mandate,
											if you&#39;re going to have the privilege
											of accessing our high seas resources,
											we need to know — someone needs to know —
											where you are and what you&#39;re doing.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So it brings me to my main take-home message,
											which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.
											We can stop the collision course
											of 50 percent of the planet
											with the high seas.
											But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.
											We need to change how we actually go about
											managing these resources.
											We need to get the new paradigm
											of precaution and respect.
											At the same time, we need to think locally,
											which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia&#39;s hope spot wish,
											is that we can shine a spotlight
											on many of these previously unknown areas,
											and to bring people to the table, if you will,
											to actually make them feel part of this community
											that truly has a stake
											in their future management.
											And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
											Our species are ocean-basin-wide.
											Many of the deep-sea communities
											have genetic distribution
											that goes ocean-basin-wide.
											We need to better understand,
											but we also need to start to manage and protect.
											And in order to do that,
											you also need ocean-basin management regimes.
											That is, we have regional management regimes
											within the exclusive economic zone,
											but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity,
											so they&#39;re like the Southern Ocean,
											where they do have the two-pronged fisheries
											and conservation organization.

											So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor
											Sylvia Earle for her wish,
											for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas
											and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.
											It&#39;s helping to bring an incredible group
											of talented people together
											to really try to solve and penetrate
											these problems that have created our obstacles
											to management and rational use
											of this area that was once so far away and remote.
