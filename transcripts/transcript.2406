											Here I am in my fourth-grade class.
											This is my yearbook picture
taken in my class in school
											in Monrovia, Liberia.
											My parents migrated from India
to West Africa in the 1970s,
											and I had the privilege
of growing up there.
											I was nine years old,
											I loved kicking around a soccer ball,
											and I was a total math and science geek.
											I was living the kind of life
that, really, any child would dream of.
											But no condition is permanent.

											On Christmas Eve in 1989,
											civil war erupted in Liberia.
											The war started in the rural countryside,
											and within months, rebel armies
had marched towards our hometown.
											My school shut down,
											and when the rebel armies captured
the only international airport,
											people started panicking and fleeing.
											My mom came knocking one morning
and said, &quot;Raj, pack your things —
											we have to go.&quot;
											We were rushed to the center of town,
											and there on a tarmac,
we were split into two lines.
											I stood with my family in one line,
											and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch
											of a rescue plane.
											And there on a bench,
I was sitting with my heart racing.
											As I looked out the open hatch,
											I saw hundreds of Liberians
in another line,
											children strapped to their backs.
											When they tried to jump in with us,
											I watched soldiers restrain them.
											They were not allowed to flee.

											We were the lucky ones.
											We lost what we had,
											but we resettled in America,
											and as immigrants, we benefitted
from the community of supporters
											that rallied around us.
											They took my family into their home,
											they mentored me.
											And they helped my dad
start a clothing shop.
											I&#39;d visit my father
on weekends as a teenager
											to help him sell sneakers and jeans.
											And every time business would get bad,
											he&#39;d remind me of that mantra:
											no condition is permanent.
											That mantra and my parents&#39; persistence
and that community of supporters
											made it possible for me
to go through college
											and eventually to medical school.
											I&#39;d once had my hopes crushed in a war,
											but because of them,
											I had a chance to pursue my dream
to become a doctor.
											My condition had changed.

											It had been 15 years
since I escaped that airfield,
											but the memory of those two lines
had not escaped my mind.
											I was a medical student in my mid-20s,
											and I wanted to go back
											to see if I could serve
the people we&#39;d left behind.
											But when I got back,
											what I found was utter destruction.
											The war had left us with just 51 doctors
											to serve a country of four million people.
											It would be like the city of San Francisco
having just 10 doctors.
											So if you got sick in the city
where those few doctors remain,
											you might stand a chance.
											But if you got sick in the remote,
rural rainforest communities,
											where you could be days
from the nearest clinic —
											I was seeing my patients die
from conditions no one should die from,
											all because they were
getting to me too late.
											Imagine you have a two-year-old
who wakes up one morning with a fever,
											and you realize she could have malaria,
											and you know the only way to get her
the medicine she needs
											would be to take her to the riverbed,
											get in a canoe, paddle to the other side
											and then walk for up to two days
through the forest
											just to reach the nearest clinic.

											One billion people live
in the world&#39;s most remote communities,
											and despite the advances we&#39;ve made
in modern medicine and technology,
											our innovations are not
reaching the last mile.
											These communities have been left behind,
											because they&#39;ve been thought
too hard to reach
											and too difficult to serve.
											Illness is universal;
											access to care is not.
											And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.
											No one should die because they live
too far from a doctor or clinic.
											No condition should be permanent.

didn&#39;t come from the outside,

											It came from the communities themselves.

											Meet Musu.
											Way out in rural Liberia,
											where most girls have not had
a chance to finish primary school,
											Musu had been persistent.
											At the age of 18,
she completed high school,
											and she came back to her community.
											She saw that none of the children
were getting treatment
											for the diseases
they needed treatment for —
											deadly diseases, like malaria
and pneumonia.
											So she signed up to be a volunteer.
											There are millions of volunteers like Musu
in rural parts around our world,
											and we got to thinking —
											community members like Musu
could actually help us solve a puzzle.

											Our health care system
is structured in such a way
											that the work of diagnosing disease
and prescribing medicines
											is limited to a team of nurses
and doctors like me.
											But nurses and doctors
are concentrated in cities,
											so rural communities like Musu&#39;s
have been left behind.

											So we started asking some questions:
											What if we could reorganize
the medical care system?
											What if we could have community
members like Musu
											be a part or even be the center
of our medical team?
											What if Musu could help us bring
health care from clinics in cities
											to the doorsteps of her neighbors?
											Musu was 48 when I met her.
											And despite her amazing talent and grit,
											she hadn&#39;t had a paying job in 30 years.
											So what if technology could support her?
											What if we could invest in her
with real training,
											equip her with real medicines,

medical technology,
											like this $1 malaria rapid test,

											and crucially,
											a smartphone, to help her track

											Last, we recognized

a chance to go to school.
											He was in middle school,
in the eighth grade,
											when his parents died.
											He became an orphan and had to drop out.
											Last year, we hired and trained
A.B. as a community health worker.
											And while he was making
door to door house calls,
											he met this young boy named Prince,
											whose mother had had trouble
breastfeeding him,
											and by the age of six months,
Prince had started to waste away.
											A.B. had just been taught how to use
this color-coded measuring tape
											that wraps around the upper arm
of a child to diagnose malnutrition.
											A.B. noticed that Prince
was in the red zone,
											which meant he had to be hospitalized.

											So here I was,
											seeing this patient
who was in her second trimester,
											and I pulled out the ultrasound
to check on the baby,
											and she started telling us stories
about her first two kids,
											and I had the ultrasound
probe on her belly,
											and she just stopped mid-sentence.
											She turned to me and she said,
											&quot;Doc, what&#39;s that sound?&quot;
											It was the first time she&#39;d ever heard
her baby&#39;s heartbeat.
											And her eyes lit up in the same way
my wife&#39;s eyes and my own eyes lit up
											when we heard our baby&#39;s heartbeat.

											For all of human history,
											illness has been universal
and access to care has not.
											But as a wise man once told me:
											no condition is permanent.
											It&#39;s time.
											It&#39;s time for us to go as far as it takes
											to change this condition together.
