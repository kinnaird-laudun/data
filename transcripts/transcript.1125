<title>T. Boone Pickens: Let&#39;s transform energy -- with natural gas | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The US consumes 25% of the world&#39;s oil -- but as energy tycoon T. Boone Pickens points out onstage, the country has no energy policy to prepare for the inevitable. Is alternative energy our bridge to an oil-free future? After losing $150 million investing in wind energy, Pickens suggests it isn&#39;t, not yet. What might get us there? Natural gas. After the talk, watch for a lively Q&amp;amp;A with TED Curator Chris Anderson." />

											I&#39;m a believer.
											I&#39;m a believer in global warming,
											and my record is good
											on the subject.
											But my subject
											is national security.
											We have to get off of oil purchased
											from the enemy.
											I&#39;m talking about OPEC oil.
											And let me take you back
											100 years
											to 1912.
											You&#39;re probably thinking that was my birth year.
											(Laughter)
											It wasn&#39;t. It was 1928.
											But go back to 1912,
											100 years ago,
											and look at that point
											what we, our country, was faced with.
											It&#39;s the same energy question
											that you&#39;re looking at today,
											but it&#39;s different sources of fuel.
											A hundred years ago
											we were looking at coal, of course,
											and we were looking at whale oil
											and we were looking at crude oil.
											At that point,
											we were looking for a fuel
											that was cleaner,
											it was cheaper,
											and it wasn&#39;t ours though,
											it was theirs.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So at that point, 1912,
											we selected crude oil over whale oil
											and some more coal.
											But as we moved on
											to the period now, 100 years later,
											we&#39;re back really
											at another decision point.
											What is the decision point?
											It&#39;s what we&#39;re going to use
											in the future.
											So from here,
											it&#39;s pretty clear to me,
											we would prefer to have
											cleaner, cheaper,
											domestic, ours —
											and we have that, we have that —
											which is natural gas.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So here you are,
											that the cost of all this to the world
											is 89 million barrels of oil,
											give or take a few barrels, every day.
											And the cost annually
											is three trillion dollars.
											And one trillion of that
											goes to OPEC.
											That has got to be stopped.
											Now if you look at the cost of OPEC,
											it cost seven trillion dollars —
											on the Milken Institute study last year —
											seven trillion dollars
											since 1976,
											is what we paid for oil from OPEC.
											Now that includes the cost of military
											and the cost of the fuel both.
											But it&#39;s the greatest transfer of wealth,
											from one group to another
											in the history of mankind.
											And it continues.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now when you look
											at where is the transfer of wealth,
											you can see here
											that we have the arrows
											going into the Mid-East
											and away from us.
											And with that,
											we have found ourselves
											to be the world&#39;s policemen.
											We are policing the world,
											and how are we doing that?
											I know the response to this.
											I would bet there aren&#39;t 10 percent of you in the room
											that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world.
											Raise your hand if you think you know.
											There are 12.
											One is under construction by the Chinese
											and the other 11 belong to us.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Why do we have 11 aircraft carriers?
											Do we have a corner on the market?
											Are we smarter than anybody else? I&#39;m not sure.
											If you look at where they&#39;re located —
											and on this slide it&#39;s the red blobs on there —
											there are five that are operating in the Mid-East,
											and the rest of them are in the United States.
											They just move back to the Mid-East and those come back.
											So actually most of the 11 we have
											are tied up in the Mid-East.
											Why? Why are they in the Mid-East?
											They&#39;re there to control,
											keep the shipping lanes open
											and make oil available.
											And the United States uses about 20 million barrels a day,
											which is about 25 percent of all the oil used
											everyday in the world.
											And we&#39;re doing it with four percent of the population.
											Somehow that doesn&#39;t seem right.
											That&#39;s not sustainable.

											Yes, it&#39;s going to continue.
											The slide you&#39;re looking at here

											Over that period

											And when you look at what we&#39;re using the oil for,

											It comes out of the ground at 130 octane.

											You take eight million trucks —
											these are 18-wheelers —
											and take them to natural gas,
											reduce carbon by 30 percent,
