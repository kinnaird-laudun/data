<meta content="We teach girls that they can have ambition, but not too much ... to be successful, but not too successful, or they'll threaten men, says author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. In this classic talk that started a worldwide conversation about feminism, Adichie asks that we begin to dream about and plan for a different, fairer world — of happier men and women who are truer to themselves." itemprop='description'>

											So I would like to start by telling you
about one of my greatest friends,
											Okoloma Maduewesi.
											Okoloma lived on my street
											and looked after me like a big brother.
											If I liked a boy,
I would ask Okoloma&#39;s opinion.
											Okoloma died in the notorious
Sosoliso plane crash
											in Nigeria in December of 2005.
											Almost exactly seven years ago.
											Okoloma was a person I could argue with,
laugh with and truly talk to.
											He was also the first person
to call me a feminist.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I was about fourteen,
we were at his house, arguing.
											Both of us bristling
with half bit knowledge
											from books that we had read.
											I don&#39;t remember what this
particular argument was about,
											but I remember
that as I argued and argued,
											Okoloma looked at me and said,
&quot;You know, you&#39;re a feminist.&quot;
											It was not a compliment.

											I could tell from his tone,
											the same tone that you would use
to say something like,
											&quot;You&#39;re a supporter of terrorism.&quot;

									<p>
											I did not know exactly
what this word &quot;feminist&quot; meant,
											and I did not want Okoloma
to know that I did not know.
											So I brushed it aside,
and I continued to argue.
											And the first thing
I planned to do when I got home
											was to look up the word
&quot;feminist&quot; in the dictionary.
									</p>

											Now fast forward to some years later,
											I wrote a novel about a man
who among other things beats his wife
											and whose story doesn&#39;t end very well.
											While I was promoting
the novel in Nigeria,
											a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man,
											told me he wanted to advise me.
											And for the Nigerians here,
											I&#39;m sure we&#39;re all familiar
											with how quick our people are
to give unsolicited advice.
											He told me that people were saying
that my novel was feminist
											and his advice to me —
											and he was shaking his head
sadly as he spoke —
											was that I should never
call myself a feminist
											because feminists
are women who are unhappy
											because they cannot find husbands.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I decided to call myself
&quot;a happy feminist.&quot;
											Then an academic, a Nigerian woman told me
											that feminism was not our culture
											and that feminism wasn&#39;t African,
											and that I was calling myself a feminist
											because I had been corrupted
by &quot;Western books.&quot;
											Which amused me,
											because a lot of my early readings
were decidedly unfeminist.
											I think I must have read every single
Mills &amp; Boon romance published
											before I was sixteen.
											And each time I tried to read those books
											called &quot;the feminist classics,&quot;
											I&#39;d get bored, and I really
struggled to finish them.
											But anyway, since feminism was un-African,
											I decided that I would now call myself
&quot;a happy African feminist.&quot;
											At some point I was a happy African
feminist who does not hate men
											and who likes lip gloss
											and who wears high heels
for herself but not for men.

											Now here&#39;s a story from my childhood.
											When I was in primary school,
											my teacher said at the beginning of term
that she would give the class a test
											and whoever got the highest score
would be the class monitor.
											Now, class monitor was a big deal.
											If you were a class monitor,
											you got to write down
the names of noisemakers —

											which was having enough power of its own.
											But my teacher would also give you
a cane to hold in your hand
											while you walk around
and patrol the class for noisemakers.
											Now, of course you were not
actually allowed to use the cane.
											But it was an exciting prospect
for the nine-year-old me.
											I very much wanted
to be the class monitor.
											And I got the highest score on the test.
											Then, to my surprise, my teacher said
that the monitor had to be a boy.
											She had forgotten
to make that clear earlier
											because she assumed it was ... obvious.

											A boy had the second highest
score on the test,

											Now, what was even more
interesting about this
											is that the boy was a sweet, gentle soul
											who had no interest
in patrolling the class with the cane,
											while I was full of ambition to do so.
											But I was female and he was male,
											and so he became the class monitor.
											And I&#39;ve never forgotten that incident.

											I often make the mistake of thinking
											that something that is obvious to me
is just as obvious to everyone else.
											Now, take my dear friend Louis
											for example.
											Louis is a brilliant, progressive man,
											and we would have conversations

than men in the world,

											Gender matters everywhere in the world,
											but I want to focus on Nigeria
											and on Africa in general,
											because it is where I know,
and because it is where my heart is.
											And I would like today to ask
											that we begin to dream about
and plan for a different world,
											a fairer world,
											a world of happier men and happier women
who are truer to themselves.
											And this is how to start:
											we must raise our daughters differently.
											We must also raise our sons differently.
											We do a great disservice to boys
on how we raise them;
											we stifle the humanity of boys.
											We define masculinity
in a very narrow way,
											masculinity becomes this hard, small cage
											and we put boys inside the cage.
											We teach boys to be afraid of fear.
											We teach boys to be afraid
of weakness, of vulnerability.
											We teach them to mask their true selves,
											because they have to be,
in Nigerian speak, &quot;hard man!&quot;
											In secondary school, a boy and a girl,
both of them teenagers,
											both of them with the same amount
of pocket money, would go out
											and then the boy
would be expected always to pay,
											to prove his masculinity.
											And yet we wonder why boys are more likely
to steal money from their parents.

											What if both boys and girls were raised
											not to link masculinity with money?
											What if the attitude
was not &quot;the boy has to pay&quot;
											but rather &quot;whoever has more should pay?&quot;
											Now, of course because
of that historical advantage,
											it is mostly men who will have more today,
											but if we start
raising children differently,
											then in fifty years, in a hundred years,
											boys will no longer have the pressure
of having to prove this masculinity.
											But by far the worst thing we do to males,
											by making them feel
that they have to be hard,
											is that we leave them
with very fragile egos.
											The more &quot;hard man&quot;
the man feels compelled to be,
											the weaker his ego is.
											And then we do a much greater
disservice to girls
											because we raise them
to cater to the fragile egos of men.
											We teach girls to shrink themselves,
to make themselves smaller,
											we say to girls,
											&quot;You can have ambition, but not too much.&quot;

											Recently a young woman
was gang raped in a university in Nigeria,
											I think some of us know about that.
											And the response of many young Nigerians,
both male and female,
											was something along the lines of this:
											&quot;Yes, rape is wrong.
											But what is a girl doing
in a room with four boys?&quot;
											Now, if we can forget
the horrible inhumanity of that response,
											these Nigerians have been raised
to think of women as inherently guilty,
											and they have been raised
to expect so little of men
											that the idea of men as savage beings
without any control
											is somehow acceptable.
											We teach girls shame.
											&quot;Close your legs.&quot; &quot;Cover yourself.&quot;
											We make them feel
as though by being born female
											they&#39;re already guilty of something.
											And so, girls grow up to be women
											who cannot see they have desire.
											They grow up to be women
who silence themselves.
											They grow up to be women
who cannot say what they truly think,
											and they grow up —
											and this is the worst thing
we did to girls —
											they grow up to be women
who have turned pretense into an art form.
