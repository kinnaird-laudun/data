											So, I&#39;m in Chile,

											Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands
											taking pictures of penguins.
											This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical.
											So, literally, a few minutes before that,
											I downloaded this scientific paper
											about calculations on avian defecation,
											which is really quite interesting, because it turns out
											you can model this as something called &quot;Poiseuille flow,&quot;
											and you can learn an awful lot
											about the physics of the avian rectum.
											Actually, technically, it&#39;s not a rectum. It&#39;s called a cloaca.

											At this point, she stops me,
											and she says, &quot;Who are you?
											Wha — what do you do?&quot;
											And I was stuck,
											because I didn&#39;t have any way to describe what I do.
											And so, in some sense,
											this talk today
											is my answer to that.
											It&#39;s a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.
											And it&#39;s very hard for me to make sense of it,
											so I&#39;m not sure that you can.
											It&#39;s the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes —
											often at four in the morning.

											So, one of the things that I love to do
											is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.
											Because archaeology gives us an opportunity
											to study past civilizations,

											And recently, I was in Easter Island,
											which is an incredibly beautiful place,
											and an incredibly mysterious place,
											because no matter where you go in Easter Island,
											you&#39;re struck by these statues, called the moai.
											The place is 64 square miles.
											They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.
											Why on Earth? And if you haven&#39;t read
											Jared Diamond&#39;s book, &quot;Collapse,&quot;
											I totally recommend that you do.
											He&#39;s got a great chapter about it.
											Basically, these people
											committed ecological suicide
											in order to make more of these.
											And somewhere along the line, somebody said,
											&quot;I know! Let&#39;s cut down the last tree
											and commit suicide, because
											we need more identical statues.&quot;

											was when I grew up — because when I was a little kid, I&#39;d seen these pictures —
											and I thought, &quot;Well, why that look on the face?
											Why that brow?&quot; I mean, it&#39;s such a powerful thing.
											Where did they get that inspiration?
											And then I met Yoyo,
											who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,
											and if you look at Yoyo&#39;s face,
											you kind of figure out where they got it.

											There&#39;s many mysteries, these statues.
											Everyone wants to know, how did they make them,
											how did they transport them?
											This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.
											She&#39;s the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.
											And she has studied the statues for 20-some years,
											and she has detailed records of every single statue.
											The one on the page here is the same that&#39;s up there.
											One interesting problem is the stone isn&#39;t very hard.
											So, this used to be completely smooth.
											In fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,
											the backs are totally smooth — almost glass smooth.
											But after 1,000 years out in the weather,
											they look like this.

											Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,
											and we&#39;re going to do a very high-res digitization,
											first because it&#39;s a way of preserving them.
											Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,
											learn a few of the mysteries about them.
											How long have they been standing in what positions?
											And maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of
											what caused them to be the way they are.
											While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,

											I also have an archaeological project going on
											in Egypt.
											&quot;Going on&quot; is perhaps a little bit strong.
											We&#39;re trying to get all of the permissions
											to get everything all set, to get it going.
											So, I&#39;ll talk about it at a future TED.
											But there&#39;s some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.
											Another thing I do is I invent stuff.
											In fact, I design nuclear reactors.
											Not a joke.
											This is the conventional
											nuclear fuel cycle.
											The red line is what is done in
											most nuclear reactors. It&#39;s called the open fuel cycle.
											The white lines are what&#39;s called an advance fuel cycle,
											where you reprocess.

											Now, this is the normal way it&#39;s done.
											It&#39;s got the huge advantage that it
											does not create carbon pollution.
											It has a lot of disadvantages:
											each one of these steps is extremely expensive,
											it&#39;s potentially dangerous
											and they have the interesting property that the step
											cannot be performed in anyone&#39;s backyard,
											which is a problem.
											So, our reactor eliminates these steps,
											which, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.
											Now, it&#39;s kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.
											There&#39;s — no reactor&#39;s been even built
											to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States
											for 25 years.
											It&#39;s the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return

											Changing into a totally different field,
											we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,
											particularly in an area called metamaterials.
											A metamaterial is an artificial material,
											which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,
											in a way that you couldn&#39;t otherwise.
											So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.
											It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,
											this is how you would view it.
											Rays of light — in this case, microwave light —
											come in, and they just squish around the cell,
											and they come back the other side.
											Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.
											The cool thing is, this does it from all angles.
											Metamaterials, unfortunately —
											A, it only works on microwave,
											and B, it doesn&#39;t work all that well yet.
											But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.
											It&#39;s — you know, today I&#39;d like to say
											it&#39;s a zero billion dollar business, but,
											in fact, it&#39;s negative.
											But some day, some day, maybe it&#39;s going to work.

											Now, I&#39;m also very interested in cooking.
											While I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence
											and went to a chef school in France.
											I used to work, also while at Microsoft,
											at a leading restaurant in Seattle,
											so I do a lot of cooking.
											I&#39;ve been on a team that won
											the world championship of barbecue.
											But barbecue&#39;s interesting, because it&#39;s one of these cult foods
											like chili, or bouillabaisse.
											Various parts of the world will have a cult food
											that people get enormously attached to —
											there&#39;s tremendous traditions, there&#39;s secrecy.
											And I&#39;m trying to use a very
											scientific approach.
											So, this is my latest cooker,
											and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,
											that&#39;s because it is.
											But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials —
											and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software —
											you can make some terrific ribs.

											So, another random thing I do
											is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,
											or SETI.
											And you may be familiar with the movie &quot;Contact,&quot;
											which sort of popularized that.
											It turns out there are real people who go out
											and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.
											In fact, almost everybody in the movie
											is based on a real character, a real person.
											So, the Jodie Foster character here
											is actually this woman, Jill Tarter,
											and Jill has dedicated her life to this.
											You know, a lot of people risk their lives
											in a brief act of heroism,
											which is kind of cool,
											but Jill has
											what I call slow heroism.
											She is risking her professional life on something
											that her own calculations show
											may not work for a thousand years — may not ever.

											I mean, can you imagine? E.T.&#39;s phoning home,

											So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.
											I&#39;m known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.
											And I resemble that remark.
											I&#39;m going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,
											which is the finding of them.
											Now, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions
											looking for a dinosaur.
											It sounds really dumb, but that&#39;s what it is.
											It&#39;s horrible conditions, because
											wherever you have nice weather,
											plants grow,
											and you don&#39;t get any erosion, and you don&#39;t see any dinosaurs.
											So, you always find dinosaurs
											in deserts or badlands,
											areas that have very little plant growth
											and have flash floods in the spring.
											You know, skiers pray for snow?
											Paleontologists pray for erosion.

											So, you hike around
											and — this is after you dig them up, they look like this.
											You hike around, you see something like this.
											Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.
											You&#39;ve got this bentonite clay,

											which is — sort of swells up and expands.
											And there&#39;s some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,
											and you look up close, and you say,
											&quot;Well, gee, that&#39;s kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?&quot;
											Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,
											from the shape, that these are skull fragments.
											And then when you look at this,
											you say, &quot;That&#39;s a tooth.
											It&#39;s a big tooth.&quot;
											It&#39;s about the size of a banana.
											It has a big serration on the edge.
											This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.
											And this is what it&#39;s like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,
											which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.

											Now, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.
											Not the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,
											and then, after buying the cast, I found my own,
											and I don&#39;t have room for two.
											You know.
											So, the thing that&#39;s wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs
											is that it is both an intellectual thing,
											because you&#39;re trying to reconstruct the environment
											of millions of years ago.
											It&#39;s something that can inform all sorts of science
											in unexpected ways.
											The study of dinosaurs led to the realization
											that there&#39;s a problem with asteroid impact,
											for example.
											The study of dinosaurs may, literally,
											one day save the planet.

											Study of the ancient climate is very important.
											In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,
											had much higher CO2 than today,
											was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points
											for the effects of CO2 on climate.
											But, besides being intellectually
											and scientifically interesting, it&#39;s also very different
											than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.
											This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.
											This is one of my papers: &quot;A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod.&quot;
											It&#39;s not as gripping as dinosaur sex,
											so we&#39;re not going to go into it further.

											Now, I&#39;m also really big on photography.
											I travel all over the world taking pictures —
											some of them good, most of them not.
											These days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means
											you&#39;ve got to spend more time sorting through them.
											Here&#39;s a picture I took in the Falkland Islands
											of king penguins on a beach.
											Here&#39;s a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.
											I&#39;d gone up to photograph Orcas,
											and we had looked for a week,
											and we hadn&#39;t seen a damn Orca.
											And the last day, the sun comes out,
											the Orcas come, they&#39;re right by the boat. It&#39;s fantastic.
											And I get lots of pictures like this.
											Then, a little bit later,
											I start getting some pictures like this.
											Now, to a human audience, I need to explain that
											if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,
											this would be the centerfold.
											It&#39;s true.
											So, there&#39;s more and more activity near the boat,
