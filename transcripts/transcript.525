									<p>
											This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,
											I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED&#39;s secret sister
											that pays all the bills.
											It&#39;s held every two years in Burma.
											And I particularly remember a really good speech
											by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.
											(Laughter)
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But, actually, it&#39;s suddenly come to me after years working in the business,
											that what we create in advertising,
											which is intangible value — you might call it perceived value,
											you might call it badge value, subjective value,
											intangible value of some kind —
											gets rather a bad rap.
											If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future
											where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.
											You can either live in a world which is poorer,
											which people in general don&#39;t like.
											Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value
											constitutes a greater part of overall value,
											that actually intangible value, in many ways
											is a very, very fine substitute
											for using up labor or limited resources
											in the creation of things.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.
											The question was given to a bunch of engineers,
											about 15 years ago, &quot;How do we make the journey to Paris better?&quot;
											And they came up with a very good engineering solution,
											which was to spend six billion pounds
											building completely new tracks
											from London to the coast,
											and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.
											Now, call me Mister Picky. I&#39;m just an ad man ...
											... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey
											merely to make it shorter.
											Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost
											on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Here is my naive advertising man&#39;s suggestion.
											What you should in fact do is employ all of the world&#39;s top male
											and female supermodels,
											pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus
											for the entire duration of the journey.
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											Now, you&#39;ll still have about three billion pounds left in change,
											and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.
											(Laughter)
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, here is another naive advertising man&#39;s question again.
											And this shows that engineers,
											medical people, scientific people,
											have an obsession with solving the problems of reality,
											when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth
											in society, most problems are actually problems of perception.
											So I&#39;ll ask you another question.
											What on earth is wrong with placebos?
											They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.
											They work extraordinarily well.
											They have no side effects,
											or if they do, they&#39;re imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.
											(Laughter)
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog
											by Tyler Cowen. I don&#39;t know if anybody knows it.
											Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,
											and actually produce placebo education.
											The point is that education doesn&#39;t actually work by teaching you things.
											It actually works by giving you the impression
											that you&#39;ve had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense
											of unwarranted self-confidence,
											which then makes you very, very successful in later life.
											So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.
											How many problems of life can be solved
											actually by tinkering with perception,
											rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business
											of actually trying to change reality?
											Here&#39;s a great example from history. I&#39;ve heard this attributed to several other kings,
											but doing a bit of historical research,
											it seems to be Fredrick the Great.
											Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen
											for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,
											because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,
											wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.
											And you get a far lower risk of famine,
											because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.

											The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.
											And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables —
											rather like contemporary Scottish people.
											(Laughter)
											So, actually, he tried making it compulsory.
											The Prussian peasantry said,
											&quot;We can&#39;t even get the dogs to eat these damn things.
											They are absolutely disgusting and they&#39;re good for nothing.&quot;
											There are even records of people being executed

											So he tried plan B.
											He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato
											as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.
											And he planted it in a royal potato patch,
											with guards who had instructions
											to guard over it, night and day,
											but with secret instructions not to guard it very well.
											(Laughter)
											Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one
											pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,
											it&#39;s worth stealing.
											Before long, there was a massive underground
											potato-growing operation in Germany.
											What he&#39;d effectively done is he&#39;d re-branded the potato.

											Another fantastic case of creating intangible value

											This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.
											The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,
											were encouraged to give in all their jewelry.
											And it was replaced with replica jewelry

											Here&#39;s one: &quot;Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813.&quot;
											The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,
											the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia
											wasn&#39;t made of gold or diamonds.
											It was made of cast iron.
											Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value

An early fan of the Internet, he was among the first in the traditional ad world to see the potential in these relatively unknown technologies. <br /><br />An immediate understanding of the possibilities of digital technology and the Internet powered Sutherland&#39;s meteoric rise.

He joined Ogilvy &amp; Mather&#39;s planning department in 1988, and became a junior copywriter, working on Microsoft&#39;s account in its pre-Windows days. An early fan of the Internet, he was among the first in the traditional ad world to see the potential in these relatively unknown technologies. <br /><br />An immediate understanding of the possibilities of digital technology and the Internet powered Sutherland&#39;s meteoric rise. He continues to provide insight into advertising in the age of the Internet and social media through his blog at Campaign&#39;s Brand Republic site, his column <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/all/587596/the-wiki-man.thtml\">&quot;The Wiki Man&quot;</a> at <em>The Spectator</em> and his busy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rorysutherland\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter account</a>.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Rory Sutherland","tags":["advertising","business","consumerism","creativity","economics","happiness","life","psychology"],"title":"Life lessons from an ad man","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2989063}]}
