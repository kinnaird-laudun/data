<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: It&#39;s amazing what a rigged game of Monopoly can reveal. In this entertaining but sobering talk, social psychologist Paul Piff shares his research into how people behave when they feel wealthy. (Hint: badly.)

In this entertaining but sobering talk, social psychologist Paul Piff shares his research into how people behave when they feel wealthy. (Hint: badly.)

											I want you to, for a moment,
											think about playing a game of Monopoly.
											Except in this game,
that combination of skill, talent and luck
											that helped earn you success
in games, as in life,
											has been rendered irrelevant,
											because this game&#39;s been rigged,
											and you&#39;ve got the upper hand.
											You&#39;ve got more money,
											more opportunities to move
around the board,
											and more access to resources.
											And as you think about that experience,
											I want you to ask yourself:
											How might that experience of being
a privileged player in a rigged game
											change the way you think about yourself
											and regard that other player?

											So, we ran a study
on the UC Berkeley campus
											to look at exactly that question.
											We brought in more than 100 pairs
of strangers into the lab,
											and with the flip of a coin,
											randomly assigned one of the two
to be a rich player in a rigged game.
											They got two times as much money;
											when they passed Go,
they collected twice the salary;
											and they got to roll
both dice instead of one,
											so they got to move
around the board a lot more.

hidden cameras what happened.
											What I want to do today,
for the first time,
											is show you a little bit of what we saw.
											You&#39;ll to have to pardon
the sound quality,

											Paul Piff: So it was quickly apparent
to players that something was up.
											One person clearly has
a lot more money than the other person,
											and yet, as the game unfolded,
											we saw very notable differences,
dramatic differences begin to emerge
											between the two players.
											The rich player started to move
around the board louder,
											literally smacking the board
with the piece as he went around.

											Now, this game of Monopoly can be used

have a lot of wealth and a lot of status,

											they have a lot less wealth
and a lot less status
											and a lot less access to valued resources.
											And what my colleagues and I
for the last seven years have been doing
											is studying the effects
of these kinds of hierarchies.
											What we&#39;ve been finding
across dozens of studies
											and thousands of participants
across this country
											is that as a person&#39;s levels
of wealth increase,
											their feelings of compassion
and empathy go down,
											and their feelings of entitlement,
of deservingness,
											and their ideology
of self-interest increase.
											In surveys, we&#39;ve found
											that it&#39;s actually wealthier individuals
who are more likely to moralize
											greed being good,
											and that the pursuit of self-interest
is favorable and moral.
											Now, what I want to do today
is talk about some of the implications
											of this ideology self-interest,
											talk about why we should
care about those implications,

call &quot;pro-social behavior.&quot;
											And we were really interested
											in who&#39;s more likely
to offer help to another person:
											someone who&#39;s rich or someone who&#39;s poor.
											In one of the studies,
											we bring rich and poor members
of the community into the lab,
											and give each of them
the equivalent of 10 dollars.
											We told the participants they could keep
these 10 dollars for themselves,
											or they could share
a portion of it, if they wanted to,
											with a stranger, who&#39;s totally anonymous.
											They&#39;ll never meet that stranger;
the stranger will never meet them.
											And we just monitor how much people give.
											Individuals who made 25,000,

of their money to the stranger

150,000, 200,000 dollars a year.
