<title>Jessica Shortall: The US needs paid family leave -- for the sake of its future | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We need women to work, and we need working women to have babies. So why is America one of the only countries in the world that offers no national paid leave to new working mothers? In this incisive talk, Jessica Shortall makes the impassioned case that the reality of new working motherhood in America is both hidden and horrible: millions of women, every year, are forced back to work within just weeks of giving birth. Her idea worth spreading: the time has come for us to recognize the economic, physical and psychological costs of our approach to working mothers and their babies, and to secure our economic future by providing paid leave to all working parents." />

<meta content='The US needs paid family leave — for the sake of its future' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='We need women to work, and we need working women to have babies. So why is America one of the only countries in the world that offers no national paid leave to new working mothers? In this incisive talk, Jessica Shortall makes the impassioned case that the reality of new working motherhood in America is both hidden and horrible: millions of women, every year, are forced back to work within just weeks of giving birth. Her idea worth spreading: the time has come for us to recognize the economic, physical and psychological costs of our approach to working mothers and their babies, and to secure our economic future by providing paid leave to all working parents.' itemprop='description'>

											I want to break this choice thing

											The first choice says
that women have chosen to work.
											So, that&#39;s not true.
											Today in America, women make up
47 percent of the workforce,
											and in 40 percent of American households
											a woman is the sole
or primary breadwinner.
											Our paid work is a part, a huge part,
of the engine of this economy,

for the engines of our families.
											On a national level,
our paid work is not optional.

											Choice number two says that women
are choosing to have babies,
											so women alone should bear
the consequences of those choices.
											You know, that&#39;s one of those things
											that when you hear it in passing,
can sound correct.
											I didn&#39;t make you have a baby.
											I certainly wasn&#39;t there
when that happened.
											But that stance
ignores a fundamental truth,
											which is that our procreation
on a national scale is not optional.
											The babies that women, many of them
working women, are having today,
											will one day fill our workforce,
protect our shores,
											make up our tax base.
											Our procreation
on a national scale is not optional.
											These aren&#39;t choices.
											We need women to work.
We need working women to have babies.
											So we should make
doing those things at the same time
											at least palatable, right?

											OK, this is pop quiz time:
