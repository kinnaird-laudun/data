<title>Mike Kinney: A pro wrestler&#39;s guide to confidence | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: You are more than you think you are, says former pro wrestler Mike Kinney -- you just have to find what makes you unique and use it to your advantage. For years Kinney &quot;turned up&quot; the parts of himself that made him special as he invented and perfected his wrestling persona, Cowboy Gator Magraw. In a talk equal parts funny and smart, he brings his wisdom from the ring to everyday life, sharing how we can all live more confidently and reach our full potential." />

<meta content='You are more than you think you are, says former pro wrestler Mike Kinney — you just have to find what makes you unique and use it to your advantage. For years Kinney "turned up" the parts of himself that made him special as he invented and perfected his wrestling persona, Cowboy Gator Magraw. In a talk equal parts funny and smart, he brings his wisdom from the ring to everyday life, sharing how we can all live more confidently and reach our full potential.' itemprop='description'>

											Picture it: a big, sweaty, tattooed man
											in a cowboy hat and chaps,
											is in the ring
											as the arena full of fans cheer him on.
											Their hero:
											&quot;Cowboy&quot; Gator Magraw.
											Gator bounces off the ropes
and is quickly body-slammed to the mat.
											His wild opponent leaps into the air,
											crashing down onto Gator&#39;s rib cage.
											Gator struggles to breathe, wondering:

wanted for me?&quot;

											I grew up watching professional wrestling
											with my dad.
											And like him, I loved everything about it:
											the showmanship, the athletic skill,
											the drama.
											I&#39;d be this little boy, bouncing
all over our living room,
											pretending to be my favorite
wrestlers from TV.
											My dad actually reminded me
a little bit of Hulk Hogan,
											but I was Hulk Hogan
and he was Andre the Giant.
											I&#39;d get all serious on him
and say things like, &quot;Dad ...
											someday I am going to be
world heavyweight champion.&quot;
											And he would usually smile
and very calmly say,
											&quot;OK, then I guess I can count on you
to be my retirement fund.&quot;

											When I was 16,
											a small wrestling show came
to my little town in Minnesota.
											I couldn&#39;t believe it.
											Nothing like that had ever
come to my town before.
											So I got to the arena
early in the morning the day of the show,
											waiting out in the parking lot
to see if I could spot some wrestlers
											pulling up in their cars.
											It wasn&#39;t as creepy as it sounds.
											But I could definitely tell
who the wrestlers were,
											just the way they walked.
											They were tall and confident
and intimidating,
											with their tank tops
and Zubaz and fanny packs.
											Why wouldn&#39;t I want to be them?

											All I could think about
was who are these people,
											and what are they like?
											How did they become wrestlers?
											So before the show started,
											I walked into this tiny arena —
											more like a gymnasium —
											and I asked them if I could help
set up the wrestling ring.
											&quot;Sure, kid. No problem.&quot;
											And then I pleaded with them
to show me some wrestling moves.
											&quot;Sure, kid. No problem.&quot;
											Man, they would just punch
and kick me — hard!
											But I never complained.
											They would come to my town for one night
every couple of months that year,
											and then — poof! —
next day, they were gone.

											By the next year,
											they finally told me about an actual
wrestling training camp
											that one of the wrestlers was running,
											and I begged my parents to sign me up.
											Next thing I knew,
I was a high school senior by day
											and wrestling in front of live
audiences by night.
											I had this giant poster of an alligator
hanging on my bedroom wall.
											So when I needed to come up with

											Not long after I started wrestling,

on the scene a long time

											I just said, &quot;I don&#39;t know
what I&#39;m doing.&quot;
											And then we just sat there in silence —
											just ... silence.
											Before he got up to get ready
for his own match,
											he gave me this piece of advice
											that would change the entire
direction of my life.
											He told me the best wrestlers
are just themselves, but &quot;turned up.&quot;
											He said successful wrestlers
find the traits within themselves
											they&#39;re the strongest at

of who they become in the ring.

											So there I sat —
											a scared teenager
who didn&#39;t know who he was

											I looked around the locker room
at some of the other wrestlers,

											&quot;I look so different.
How can I ever be like them?&quot;
											And then it hit me.
											That&#39;s the moment I realized
I didn&#39;t have to be like them.
											What I did have to do was find out:
What did it mean to be me?
											What made me unique,
											and how could I use it to my advantage?
											I knew I wasn&#39;t a chiseled athlete
like some of these guys,
											but I really didn&#39;t care.
											So the first thing I thought was,
											&quot;How can I amplify something as simple
as: comfortable with my own body?&quot;
											I didn&#39;t know.

											Look, the wrestling circus doesn&#39;t need
to come to your town
											before you get an invitation
to be the real you —
											the bigger, more stunning
version of yourself.
											It doesn&#39;t even necessarily
come from our parents.
											Turning yourself up means looking inward
toward our true selves
											and harnessing the voice that says,
											&quot;Maybe, just maybe,
											I am more than I thought I was.&quot;
