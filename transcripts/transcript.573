											When I was a kid, growing up in New York,

											smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls.
											And my mother, brave lady,
											was partly to blame,
											taking me to the New York Natural History Museum,
											buying me books on snakes,
											and then starting this infamous career of mine,
											which has culminated in
											of course, arriving in India 60 years ago,
											brought by my mother, Doris Norden,
											and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.

											It&#39;s been a roller coaster ride.
											Two animals, two iconic reptiles
											really captivated me very early on.
											One of them was the remarkable gharial.
											This crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long
											in the northern rivers,
											and this charismatic snake, the king cobra.
											What my purpose of the talk today really is,
											is to sort of indelibly scar your minds
											with these charismatic and majestic creatures.
											Because this is what you will take away from here,
											a reconnection with nature, I hope.

											The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons.
											What you&#39;re seeing here is very recently shot images
											in a forest nearby here,
											of a female king cobra making her nest.
											Here is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves,
											and then laying her eggs inside,
											to withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall],
											in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days,
											and hatch into little baby king cobras.
											So, she protects her eggs,
											and after three months,
											the babies finally do hatch out.
											A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality
											in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.

											My first experience with king cobras was in &#39;72
											at a magical place called Agumbe,
											in Karnataka, this state.
											And it is a marvelous rain forest.
											This first encounter
											was kind of like the
											Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.
											It really changed my life totally.
											And it brought me straight into the conservation fray.
											I ended up starting this research
											and education station in Agumbe,
											which you are all of course invited to visit.

											This is basically a base wherein
											we are trying to gather and learn
											virtually everything about the biodiversity
											of this incredibly complex forest system,
											and try to hang on to what&#39;s there,
											make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,
											and of course, having a good time too.
											You can almost hear the drums
											throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we&#39;re there.
											It was very important for us to get through to the people.
											And through the children is usually the way to go.
											They are fascinated with snakes. They haven&#39;t got
											that steely thing that you end up
											either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.
											They are interested.
											And it really works to start with them.
											This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes.

											This is an average size king cobra, about 12 feet long.
											And it actually crawled into somebody&#39;s bathroom,
											and was hanging around there for two or three days.
											The people of this part of India
											worship the king cobra.
											And they didn&#39;t kill it. They called us to catch it.
											Now we&#39;ve caught more than 100 king cobras

											But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures
											[it was necessary] for us to actually insert
											a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.
											Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,
											where the babies go after they hatch,
											and remarkable things like this you&#39;re about to see.
											This was just a few days ago in Agumbe.
											I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra
											who had caught a venomous pit viper.
											And it does it in such a way that it doesn&#39;t get bitten itself.
											And king cobras feed only on snakes.
											This [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it,

											Usually they eat something a bit larger.
											In this case a rather strange and inexplicable
											activity happened over the last breeding season,
											wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,
											didn&#39;t mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.
											We&#39;re still trying to explain and come to terms with

											But they do also a lot of other remarkable things.
											This is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact
											that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes.
											This male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra.
											And they did this incredible ritual combat dance.
											It&#39;s very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans,
											you know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.

											Now, what are we doing with all this information?

											Well, the king cobra is literally
											a keystone species in these rainforests.
											And our job is to convince the authorities
											that these forests have to be protected.
											And this is one of the ways we do it,

											You&#39;ve all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger

											We were piloted, I could say,
											by a highly autocratic stateswoman,

											And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.
											And, just like Project Tiger,
											our activities with the king cobra
											is to look at a species of animal
											so that we protect its habitat and everything within it.
											So, the tiger is the icon.

											North central India, the Chambal River
											is where we have our base.
											This is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.
											It is an animal which has been on the Earth
											for just about 100 million years.
											It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.
											It has remarkable features.
											Even though it grows to 20 feet long,
											since it eats only fish it&#39;s not dangerous to human beings.
											It does have big teeth, however,
											and it&#39;s kind of hard to convince people

											But we, actually, back in the early &#39;70s,
											did surveys,
											and found that gharial were extremely rare.
											In fact, if you see the map,
											the range of their original habitat
											was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan
											to the Irrawaddy in Burma.
											And now it&#39;s just limited to a couple of spots
											in Nepal and India.
											So, in fact at this point
											there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.
											So, starting in the mid-&#39;70s
											when conservation was at the fore,
											we were actually able to start projects which were
											basically government supported
											to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests
											and release 5,000 baby gharial
											back to the wild.
											And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.
											I mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial
											basking on the river again.

											But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.
											And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,
											like sand mining, for example,
											very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river&#39;s edge,
											not allowing the animals to breed anymore,
											we&#39;re looking at
											even more problems building up for the gharial,
											despite the early good intentions.
											Their nests hatching along the riverside
											producing hundreds of hatchlings. It&#39;s just an amazing sight.
											This was actually just taken last year.
											But then the monsoon arrives,
											and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or
											there is always a barrage,
											and, shoop, they get washed down to their doom.

											Luckily there is still a lot of interest.
											My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN,
											the [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO,
											the World Wildlife Fund,
											the Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments,
											and the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff.
											But it&#39;s possibly, and definitely not enough.
											For example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,
											there was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.
											Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.
											Why? How could it happen?

											This is a relatively clean river.
											The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.
											People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it,
											something you wouldn&#39;t do in most north Indian rivers.
											So, in order to try to find out the answer to this,
											we got veterinarians from all over the world
											working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.
											I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.
											And we actually looked through
											all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.
											And it came down to something called gout,
											which, as a result of kidney breakdown
											is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,
											and worse in the joints,
											which made the gharial unable to swim.
											And it&#39;s a horribly painful death.

											Just downriver from the Chambal is the
											filthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.
											And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it
											but it&#39;s the truth. It&#39;s just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.
											It flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra,
											and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.
											So, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial
											was something in the food chain,
											something in the fish they were eating.
											And, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain
											everything is affected, including us.

											This is one of the last repositories of the

											various species of turtles,
											thousands of migratory birds,
											and fishing is causing problems like this.
											And now [these] new elements of human intolerance
											for river creatures like the gharial
											means that if they don&#39;t drown in the net,
											then they simply cut their beaks off.

											So, who is next? Us?
											Because we are all dependent on these water sources.
											So, we all know about the Narmada river,
											the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects
											which displace people and wreck river systems
											without providing livelihoods.
											And development just basically going berserk,
											for a double figure growth index, basically.
											So, we&#39;re not sure where this story is going to end,
											whether it&#39;s got a happy or sad ending.
											And climate change is certainly going
											to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.
											We&#39;re still working hard at it.

											But out on the rivers there are still millions of people
											who are in really bad shape.
											And it&#39;s a bleak future for them.
											So, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.
											We&#39;ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it,

											So, people talk about political will.
											During the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action.
											Government cut through all the red tape,
											we got foreign vets on it. It was great.
											So, we can do it.
											But if you stroll down to the Yamuna
											or to the Gomati in Lucknow,
											or to the Adyar river in Chennai,

Later he founded the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust Centre for Herpetology to re-establish three species of crocodiles that were nearing extinction. The bank now houses 3,000 crocodiles of 15 species. Currently, Whitaker is focusing on the Gharial crocodile, whose species has less than 250 members left in Indian waters. </p><p>At age 65, he shows no sign of slowing down. <strong>&ldquo;The Dragon Chronicles,&rdquo; filmed in 2008 for PBS&#39;s series <em>Nature</em>, shows Whitaker cave-diving in ice-cold water for Slovenian olms, climbing trees in pursuit of flying lizards in the Western Ghats, and Komodo dragon-wrestling in Indonesia.</strong> Awarded the 2005 Whitley prize, Whitaker used the &pound;30,000 purse to start the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station, the first to be built along the whole 1,000km length of the Western Ghats. He uses the research station to study king cobras in their natural habitat. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Romulus Whitaker","tags":["animals","biodiversity","environment","water","ecology","india"],"title":"The real danger lurking in the water","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":410972}]}
