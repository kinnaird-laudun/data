<title>Khalida Brohi: How I work to protect women from honor killings | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nearly 1000 &quot;honor&quot; killings are reported in Pakistan each year, murders by a family member for behavior deemed &quot;shameful,&quot; such as a relationship outside of marriage. When Khalida Brohi lost a close friend to the practice, she resolved to campaign against it. Yet she met resistance from an unlikely source: the very community she hoped to protect. In this powerful, honest talk, Brohi shares how she took a hard look at her own process, and offers sharp insights for other passionate activists." />

<meta content='How I work to protect women from honor killings' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Nearly 1000 "honor" killings are reported in Pakistan each year, murders by a family member for behavior deemed "shameful," such as a relationship outside of marriage. When Khalida Brohi lost a close friend to the practice, she resolved to campaign against it. Yet she met resistance from an unlikely source: the very community she hoped to protect. In this powerful, honest talk, Brohi shares how she took a hard look at her own process, and offers sharp insights for other passionate activists.' itemprop='description'>

									<p>
											While preparing for my talk
											I was reflecting on my life
and trying to figure out
											where exactly was that moment
when my journey began.
											A long time passed by,
and I simply couldn&#39;t figure out
											the beginning or the middle
or the end of my story.
											I always used to think that my beginning
											was one afternoon in my community
when my mother had told me
											that I had escaped three
arranged marriages by the time I was two.
											Or one evening when electricity had failed
for eight hours in our community,
											and my dad sat, surrounded by all of us,
											telling us stories of when he was
a little kid struggling to go to school
											while his father, who was a farmer,
wanted him to work in the fields with him.
											Or that dark night when I was 16
											when three little kids had come to me
and they whispered in my ear
											that my friend was murdered
in something called the honor killings.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But then I realized that,
											as much as I know that these moments
have contributed on my journey,
											they have influenced my journey
											but they have not been
the beginning of it,
											but the true beginning of my journey
was in front of a mud house
											in upper Sindh of Pakistan,
											where my father held the hand
of my 14-year-old mother
											and they decided
to walk out of the village
											to go to a town where they could
send their kids to school.
											In a way, I feel like my life
											is kind of a result of some wise choices
and decisions they&#39;ve made.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And just like that,
another of their decisions
											was to keep me and my siblings
connected to our roots.
											While we were living in a community
I fondly remember as called Ribabad,
											which means community of the poor,
											my dad made sure that we also
had a house in our rural homeland.
											I come from an indigenous tribe
in the mountains of Balochistan
											called Brahui.
											Brahui, or Brohi, means mountain dweller,
and it is also my language.
											Thanks to my father&#39;s very strict rules
about connecting to our customs,
											I had to live a beautiful life of songs, 
cultures, traditions, stories, mountains,
											and a lot of sheep.
											But then, living in two extremes
											between the traditions 
of my culture, of my village,
											and then modern education
in my school wasn&#39;t easy.
											I was aware that I was the only girl
who got to have such freedom,
											and I was guilty of it.
											While going to school
in Karachi and Hyderabad,
											a lot of my cousins and childhood friends
were getting married off,
											some to older men, some in exchange,
											some even as second wives.
											I got to see the beautiful tradition
and its magic fade in front of me
											when I saw that the birth of a girl child
was celebrated with sadness,
											when women were told
to have patience as their main virtue.

											Up until I was 16,
											I healed my sadness by crying,
											mostly at nights 
when everyone would sleep
											and I would sob in my pillow,
											until that one night 
when I found out my friend was killed
											in the name of honor.

											Honor killings is a custom
											where men and women
are suspected of having relationships
											before or outside of the marriage,
											and they&#39;re killed by their family for it.
											Usually the killer is the brother
or father or the uncle in the family.
											The U.N. reports there are about 1,000
honor murders every year in Pakistan,
											and these are only the reported cases.

did not make any sense to me,

anything, to stop it.

telling everybody about honor killings

why it should be stopped,

											In those days, we were living in
a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.
											Every year, during the monsoon seasons,
our house would flood up with water —
											rainwater and sewage —
											and my mom and dad
would be taking the water out.
											In those days, my dad brought home
a huge machine, a computer.
											It was so big it looked as if it was going
to take up half of the only room we had,
											and had so many pieces and wires
that needed to be connected.
											But it was still the most exciting thing
											that has ever happened
to me and my sisters.
											My oldest brother Ali got to be in charge
of taking care of the computer,
											and all of us were given
10 to 15 minutes every day to use it.
											Being the oldest of eight kids,
											I got to use it the last,
											and that was after
I had washed the dishes,
											cleaned the house,
made dinner with my mom,
											and put blankets on the floor
for everyone to sleep,
											and after that, 
I would run to the computer,
											connect it to the Internet,
											and have pure joy and wonder
for 10 to 15 minutes.

											In those days, I had discovered
a website called Joogle.
											[Google] (Laughter)
											In my frantic wish
to do something about this custom,
											I made use of Google
and discovered Facebook,
											a website where people can connect
to anyone around the world,
											and so, from my very tiny,
cement-roofed room in Karachi,
											I connected with people in the U.K.,
the U.S., Australia and Canada,
											and created a campaign called
											WAKE UP Campaign
against Honor Killings.
											It became enormous
in just a few months.
											I got a lot of support
from all around the world.
											Media was connecting to us.
											A lot of people were reaching out
trying to raise awareness with us.
											It became so big that it went from online
to the streets of my hometown,
											where we would do rallies and strikes
											trying to change the policies 
in Pakistan for women&#39;s support.
											And while I thought
everything was perfect,
											my team — which was basically
my friends and neighbors at that time —
											thought everything was going so well,
											we had no idea a big opposition

un-Islamic behavior.
											We were challenging centuries-old
customs in those communities.
											I remember my father receiving
anonymous letters

is spreading Western culture

											One day I went to the office

to hide myself in many ways.

											There were two big reasons
why our campaign had failed big time.
											One of those, the first reason,
											is we were standing
against core values of people.
											We were saying no to something
that was very important to them,
											challenging their code of honor,
											and hurting them deeply in the process.
											And number two, which was very
important for me to learn,
											and amazing, and surprising
for me to learn,
											was that we were not including
the true heroes
											who should be fighting for themselves.
											The women in the villages had no idea
we were fighting for them in the streets.
											Every time I would go back,
											I would find my cousins and friends
with scarves on their faces,
											and I would ask, &quot;What happened?&quot;
											And they&#39;d be like, 
&quot;Our husbands beat us.&quot;
											But we are working in the streets for you!
											We are changing the policies.

											So then we found out something
which was very amazing for us.
											The policies of a country
											do not necessarily always affect
the tribal and rural communities.
											It was devastating — like, oh,
we can&#39;t actually do something about this?
											And we found out there&#39;s a huge gap
											when it comes to official policies
and the real truth on the ground.

											So this time, we were like,
we are going to do something different.
											We are going to use strategy,
											and we are going to go back and apologize.
											Yes, apologize.
											We went back to the communities
											and we said we are 
very ashamed of what we did.
											We are here to apologize, and in fact,
we are here to make it up to you.
											How do we do that?
											We are going to promote
three of your main cultures.

language, and embroidery.

											Nobody believed us.
											Nobody wanted to work with us.
											It took a lot of convincing
and discussions with these communities
											until they agreed that we are going
to promote their language
											by making a booklet of their stories,
fables and old tales in the tribe,
											and we would promote their music
											by making a CD of the songs
from the tribe, and some drumbeating.
											And the third, which was my favorite,
											was we would promote their embroidery
by making a center in the village
											where women would come every day
to make embroidery.

											And so it began.
											We worked with one village,
and we started our first center.
											It was a beautiful day.
											We started the center.
											Women were coming to make embroidery,
											and going through a life-changing
process of education,
											learning about their rights,
what Islam says about their rights,
											and enterprise development,
how they can create money,
											and then how they can create
money from money,
											how they can fight the customs
that have been destroying their lives
											from so many centuries,
											because in Islam, in reality,
											women are supposed to be
shoulder to shoulder with men.
											Women have so much status
that we have not been hearing,
											that they have not been hearing,
											and we needed to tell them
that they need to know
											where their rights are
and how to take them by themselves,
											because they can do it and we can&#39;t.

									<p>
											So this was the model which actually
came out — very amazing.
											Through embroidery
we were promoting their traditions.
											We went into the village.
We would mobilize the community.
											We would make a center inside
where 30 women will come
											for six months to learn about
value addition of traditional embroidery,
											enterprise development,
life skills and basic education,
											and about their rights
and how to say no to those customs
											and how to stand as leaders
for themselves and the society.
											After six months, we would connect
these women to loans and to markets
											where they can become
local entrepreneurs in their communities.

											We soon called this project Sughar.
											Sughar is a local word used
in many, many languages in Pakistan.
											It means skilled and confident women.
											I truly believe, to create women leaders,
there&#39;s only one thing you have to do:
											Just let them know that they have
what it takes to be a leader.
											These women you see here,
											they have strong skills
and potential to be leaders.
											All we had to do was remove
the barriers that surrounded them,
											and that&#39;s what we decided to do.

											But then while we were thinking
everything was going well,
											once again everything was fantastic,
											we found our next setback:
											A lot of men started seeing
the visible changes in their wife.
											She&#39;s speaking more,
she&#39;s making decisions —
											oh my gosh, she&#39;s handling 
everything in the house.
											They stopped them
from coming to the centers,
											and this time, we were like,
okay, time for strategy two.
											We went to the fashion 
industry in Pakistan
											and decided to do research
about what happens there.
											Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistan
is very strong and growing day by day,
											but there is less contribution
from the tribal areas
											and to the tribal areas, especially women.

											So we decided to launch our first ever
tribal women&#39;s very own fashion brand,

financially to the house,
											and men had to think again
before saying no to them
											when they were coming to the centers.

											In 2013, we launched our first
Sughar Hub instead of a center.

											and created a cement hall
in the middle of a village
											and invited so many other organizations
to work over there.
											We created this platform
for the nonprofits
											so they can touch and work
on the other issues
											that Sughar is not working on,
											which would be an easy place 
for them to give trainings,
											use it as a farmer school,
even as a marketplace,
