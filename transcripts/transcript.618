											When I go out to direct a film,
											every day we prepare too much, we think too much.
											Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom.
											You know, simple words lost
											in the quicksand of experience.
											So I come up, and I say,
											&quot;What am I going to do today?&quot; I&#39;m not going to do what I planned to do,
											and I put myself into absolute panic.
											It&#39;s my one way of getting rid of my mind,
											getting rid of this mind that says,
											&quot;Hey, you know what you&#39;re doing. You know exactly what you&#39;re doing.
											You&#39;re a director, you&#39;ve done it for years.&quot;

											When I was a kid — I was about eight years old.
											You remember how India was. There was no pollution.
											In Delhi, we used to live — we used to call it a chhat or the khota.
											Khota&#39;s now become a bad word. It means their terrace —
											and we used to sleep out at night.
											At school I was being just taught about physics,
											and I was told that
											if there is something that exists,
											then it is measurable.
											If it is not measurable,
											it does not exist.
											And at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,

											So what did I do?
											At that time, at the tender age of seven,

											What was my story?
											And I don&#39;t know why, but I remember the story.
											There was a woodcutter
											who&#39;s about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,
											and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.
											And when that ax hits that piece of wood,
											that&#39;s when everything will destroy
											and the Big Bang will happen again.
											But all before that there was a woodcutter.
											And then when I would run out of that story,
											I would imagine that woodcutter&#39;s universe
											is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.
											So every time, I could tell my story again and again

											How did I do it? Tell a story.
											So what is a story?
											A story is our — all of us —
											we are the stories we tell ourselves.
											In this universe, and this existence,
											where we live with this duality
											of whether we exist or not
											and who are we,
											the stories we tell ourselves are the stories
											that define the potentialities
											of our existence.
											We are the stories we tell ourselves.
											So that&#39;s as wide as we look at stories.
											A story is the relationship
											that you develop between who you are,
											or who you potentially are,
											and the infinite world, and that&#39;s our mythology.

											We tell our stories,

											Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,

											We all, everybody, has a story that they follow.
											We tell ourselves stories.
											So, I will go further, and I say,
											&quot;I tell a story, and therefore I exist.&quot;
											I exist because there are stories,
											and if there are no stories, we don&#39;t exist.
											We create stories to define our existence.
											If we do not create the stories,
											we probably go mad.

											and I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements
											that are given to a director —
											if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera —
											would we get Buddhism better?
											But that puts some kind of burden on me.
											I have to tell a story
											in a much more elaborate way,

											It&#39;s called subtext.
											When I first went to Hollywood, they said —
											I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,
											&quot;Would you kindly not talk about subtext?&quot;
											And I said, &quot;Why?&quot; He said, &quot;Because nobody is going to give you a film

											then we look for a story
											on the psychological level,
											then we look for a story on the political level,
											then we look at a story
											on a mythological level.
											And I look for stories on each level.
											Now, it is not necessary
											that these stories agree with each other.
											What is wonderful is,
											at many times, the stories will contradict with each other.
											So when I work with Rahman who&#39;s a great musician,
											I often tell him, &quot;Don&#39;t follow what the script already says.
											Find that which is not.
											Find the truth for yourself,

											When I made the sequel to &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; here was a story that

											A woman who was threatened
											by Philip II
											and was going to war,
											and was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.
											Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,

											but the blood of being mortal flowed in her.
											But the divine one was unjust,
											so the gods said,
											&quot;OK, what we need to do is
											help the just one.&quot;
											And so they helped the just one.
											And what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down
											to physically separate her mortal self
											from her spirit self.
											And the mortal self was the girl
											that Walter Raleigh was sent,
											and gradually he separated her
											so she was free to be divine.
											And the two divine people fought,

											Elizabeth has realized,
											and she&#39;s coming face-to-face
											with her own sense of jealousy,
											her own sense of mortality.
											What am I doing with the architecture?
											The architecture is telling a story.
											The architecture is telling a story
											about how, even though she&#39;s the most powerful woman
											in the world at that time,
											there is the other, the architecture&#39;s bigger.
											The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.
											It&#39;ll survive her.
											So it&#39;s telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.
											Not only that, why is the camera looking down?
											The camera&#39;s looking down at her because she&#39;s in the well.
											She&#39;s in the absolute well
											of her own sense of being mortal.
											That&#39;s where she has to pull herself out
											from the depths of mortality,
											come in, release her spirit.
											And that&#39;s the moment where, in my mind,
											both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.
											But that&#39;s the moment
											she&#39;s surgically removing herself from that.
											So the film is operating on
											many many levels in that scene.
											And how we tell stories
											visually, with music, with actors,
											and at each level it&#39;s a different sense
											and sometimes contradictory to each other.
											So how do I start all this?
											What&#39;s the process of telling a story?

											And he said that these people in the cities,
											in one flush, expend as much water
											as you people in the rural areas
											don&#39;t get for your family for two days.
											That struck a chord, and I said, &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;
											I went to see a friend of mine,
											and he made me wait
											in his apartment in Malabar Hill
											on the twentieth floor,
											which is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.
											And he was having a shower for 20 minutes.
											I got bored and left, and as I drove out,
											I drove past the slums of Bombay,
											as you always do,
											and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun
											of women and children with buckets
											waiting for a tanker
											to come and give them water.
											And an idea started to develop.
											So how does that become a story?
											I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.

									<p>
											So my next film is called &quot;Paani&quot;
											which means water.
											And now, out of the mythology of that,
											I&#39;m starting to create a world.
											What kind of world do I create,
											and where does the idea, the design of that come?
											So, in my mind, in the future,
											they started to build flyovers.
											You understand flyovers? Yeah?
											They started to build flyovers
											to get from A to B faster,
											but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth
											to another area of relative wealth.
											And then what they did was
											they created a city above the flyovers.
											And the rich people moved to the upper city
											and left the poorer people in the lower cities,
											about 10 to 12 percent of the people
											have moved to the upper city.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, where does this upper city and lower city come?
											There&#39;s a mythology in India about —
											where they say, and I&#39;ll say it in Hindi,
											[Hindi]
											Right. What does that mean?
											It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders
											and survive on the shoulders of the poor.
											So, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.
											So the design has a story.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And now, what happens is that the people of the upper city,
											they suck up all the water.
											Remember the word I said, suck up.
											They suck up all the water, keep to themselves,
											and they drip feed the lower city.
											And if there&#39;s any revolution, they cut off the water.
											And, because democracy still exists,
											there&#39;s a democratic way in which you say
											&quot;Well, if you give us what [we want], we&#39;ll give you water.&quot;

											So, okay my time is up.
											But I can go on about telling you
											how we evolve stories,
											and how stories effectively are who we are
											and how these get translated into the particular discipline
											that I am in, which is film.
											But ultimately, what is a story? It&#39;s a contradiction.
											Everything&#39;s a contradiction.
											The universe is a contradiction.
											And all of us are constantly looking for harmony.
											When you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.
											But you get up at 4 a.m.
											That first blush of blue is where the night and day
											are trying to find harmony with each other.
											Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn&#39;t give you,
											but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that.
											All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.
											It&#39;s the effect of looking for harmony
											in the contradiction that exists in a poet&#39;s mind,
											a contradiction that exists in a storyteller&#39;s mind.
											In a storyteller&#39;s mind, it&#39;s a contradiction of moralities.
											In a poet&#39;s mind, it&#39;s a conflict of words,
											in the universe&#39;s mind, between day and night.
											In the mind of a man and a woman,
											we&#39;re looking constantly at
											the contradiction between male and female,
											we&#39;re looking for harmony within each other.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The whole idea of contradiction,
											but the acceptance of contradiction
											is the telling of a story, not the resolution.
											The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood
											and many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,
											that we try to resolve the contradiction.
											Harmony is not resolution.
											Harmony is the suggestion of a thing
											that is much larger than resolution.
											Harmony is the suggestion of something
											that is embracing and universal
											and of eternity and of the moment.
											Resolution is something that is far more limited.
											It is finite; harmony is infinite.
											So that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,
											is looking for harmony and infinity
											in moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,
											letting another go and creating a question that is really important.
