<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 1985, architect Paul Pholeros was challenged to &quot;stop people getting sick&quot; in a small indigenous community in south Australia. And it meant thinking way beyond medicine. In this sparky, interactive talk, Pholeros shares his work with Healthabitat, which works to reduce poverty through practical design fixes -- in Australia and beyond." />

											I&#39;m going to start
where the story began —
											1985, in Central Australia.
											A man called Yami Lester,
an Aboriginal man,

											Eighty percent of what walked
in the door, in terms of illness,

infectious disease,

											Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs.
											He got a medical doctor.
											He got an environmental health guy.
											And he hand-selected a team
of local Aboriginal people
											to work on this project.
											Yami told us at that first meeting,
											&quot;There&#39;s no money,&quot; —
always a good start —
											&quot; ... no money, you have six months,
											and I want you to start on a project —&quot;
which, in his language,
											he called &quot;Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku,&quot;
											which, translated, is &quot;a plan
to stop people getting sick&quot; —
											a profound brief.

for about six months.

these nine health goals —

											After six months of work,
he came to my office
											and presented me with
those nine words on a piece of paper.

in all our houses.
											Things wear out, should have been done
by state government or local government,
											simply not done, the house doesn&#39;t work.

that indigenous people trash houses.

rock-solid pieces of evidence
											which I&#39;ve never seen evidence for,

of what we spend is damage,

											We argue strongly that the people
living in the house
											are simply not the problem.
											And we&#39;ll go a lot further than that;
											the people living in the house
are actually a major part of the solution.
											Seventy-five percent
of our national team in Australia —

from the communities we work in.

											And he came out and, within a day,
											it worked out that most dust
in this community
											was within a meter of the ground,
the wind-driven dust —
											so he suggested making mounds
to catch the dust

											They could trap the flies,
send them to him in Perth.
											When the bug was in the gut,

some dung beetles.
											The dung beetles ate the camel dung,

to one other place, and that&#39;s Nepal.
											And what a beautiful place to go.
											We were asked by a small
village of 600 people
											to go in and make toilets
where none existed.
											Health was poor.
											We went in with no grand plan,
											no grand promises of a great program,
											just the offer to build
two toilets for two families.
											It was during the design
of the first toilet
											that I went for lunch,
											invited by the family
into their main room of the house.
											It was choking with smoke.
											People were cooking
on their only fuel source, green timber.
											The smoke coming off
that timber is choking,
											and in an enclosed house,
you simply can&#39;t breathe.
											Later we found the leading cause
of illness and death
											in this particular region
is through respiratory failure.

											We were there originally
to look at toilets
											and get human waste
off the ground, that&#39;s fine.
											But all of a sudden now
there was a second problem:
											How do we actually get the smoke down?
											So two problems, and design should
be about more than one thing.
											Solution: Take human waste,
take animal waste,
											put it into a chamber,
out of that, extract biogas,
											methane gas.
											The gas gives three to four
hours cooking a day —
											clean, smokeless and free for the family.

											But as we all sit here today,
											there are now over 100 toilets built

											Well over 1,000 people use those toilets.
											Yami Lama, he&#39;s a young boy.
											He&#39;s got significantly less gut infection
because he&#39;s now got toilets,
											and there isn&#39;t human waste on the ground.
											Kanji Maya, she&#39;s a mother,
and a proud one.
											She&#39;s probably right now
cooking lunch for her family
											on biogas, smokeless fuel.
											Her lungs have got better,
											and they&#39;ll get better as time increases,
											because she&#39;s not cooking
in the same smoke.
											Surya takes the waste
out of the biogas chamber
											when it&#39;s shed the gas,
he puts it on his crops.
											He&#39;s trebled his crop income,
											more food for the family
and more money for the family.
											And finally Bishnu,
the leader of the team,
											has now understood that not only
have we built toilets,
											we&#39;ve also built a team,
											and that team is now
working in two villages

the next two villages
