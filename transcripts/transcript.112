											And in terms of the temporary nature of it,
											our goal was not to create something

											I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue

											And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani&#39;s farewell address,

											And I think regardless of what the position is about how
											this sacred piece of land is to be used,
											having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter,
											I think makes it a more powerful dialogue.

											It enables that conversation to get serious.
											And six months after the fact —
											and only a few months away from the site being cleaned —
											we are very quickly, now, getting to the point
											where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious.

											The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings,

											And I think there should be a broader — which there&#39;s starting to be —
											the dialogue is really opening up to,
											what does this site really want to be?
											And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out,
											that it&#39;s going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.
											There&#39;s a few discussions right now that I think are very positive,
											about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over,
