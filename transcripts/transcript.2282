<title>Tiq Milan and Kim Katrin Milan: A queer vision of love and marriage | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Love is a tool for revolutionary change and a path toward inclusivity and understanding for the LGBTQ+ community. Married activists Tiq and Kim Katrin Milan have imagined their marriage -- as a transgender man and cis woman -- a model of possibility for people of every kind. With infectious joy, Tiq and Kim question our misconceptions about who they might be and offer a vision of an inclusive, challenging love that grows day by day." />

<meta content='Love is a tool for revolutionary change and a path toward inclusivity and understanding for the LGBTQ+ community. Married activists Tiq and Kim Katrin Milan have imagined their marriage — as a transgender man and cis woman — a model of possibility for people of every kind.

											Kim Katrin Milan: I am
a cisgender queer woman.
											Cisgender means the gender
I was assigned at birth
											is still and has always been female.
											This doesn&#39;t make me natural or normal,
											this is just one way of describing
the many different ways
											that we exist in this world.
											And queer is a cultural term,
											but in this case,
											it refers to the way that I&#39;m not
restricted by gender
											when it comes to choosing partners.
											I&#39;ve identified in a few different ways —
											as a bisexual, as a lesbian —
											but for me,
											queerness encompasses all of the layers
of who I am and how I&#39;ve loved.
											I&#39;m layers, and not fractions.
											And for me,
											the fact that he was queer
											meant that I could trust his courtship
from the very beginning.

											As queer and trans people,
											we&#39;re so often excluded
from institutions and traditions.

											we queered it;
											we laid it all on the table.

											So often what we&#39;re told is this idea
of the &quot;Golden Rule,&quot;
											that we should treat other people
the way we want to be treated.
											But the problem with that
											is that it assumes that we are
the standard for other people,
											and we&#39;re not.
											We need to treat other people
the way they want to be treated,
											which means we had to ask.
											I couldn&#39;t assume that the kind
of love that Tiq needed
											was the same kind of love that I needed.
											So I asked him everything —
about his fears, his insecurities —
											and we started from there.
