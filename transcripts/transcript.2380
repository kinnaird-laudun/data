<title>His Holiness Pope Francis: Why the only future worth building includes everyone | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A single individual is enough for hope to exist, and that individual can be you, says His Holiness Pope Francis in this searing TED Talk delivered directly from Vatican City. In a hopeful message to people of all faiths, to those who have power as well as those who don&#39;t, the spiritual leader provides illuminating commentary on the world as we currently find it and calls for equality, solidarity and tenderness to prevail. &quot;Let us help each other, all together, to remember that the &#39;other&#39; is not a statistic, or a number,&quot; he says. &quot;We all need each other.&quot;" />

<meta content='A single individual is enough for hope to exist, and that individual can be you, says His Holiness Pope Francis in this searing TED Talk delivered directly from Vatican City. In a hopeful message to people of all faiths, to those who have power as well as those who don&#x0027;t, the spiritual leader provides illuminating commentary on the world as we currently find it and calls for equality, solidarity and tenderness to prevail. "Let us help each other, all together, to remember that the &#x0027;other&#x0027; is not a statistic, or a number," he says. "We all need each other."' itemprop='description'>

											Good evening – or, good morning,
I am not sure what time it is there.
											Regardless of the hour, I am thrilled
to be participating in your conference.
											I very much like its title
– &quot;The Future You&quot; –
											because, while looking at tomorrow,
it invites us to open a dialogue today,
											to look at the future through a &quot;you.&quot;
											&quot;The Future You:&quot;
											the future is made of yous,
it is made of encounters,
											because life flows
through our relations with others.
											Quite a few years of life
											have strengthened my conviction
											that each and everyone&#39;s existence
is deeply tied to that of others:
											life is not time merely passing by,
life is about interactions.

											As I meet, or lend an ear
to those who are sick,
											to the migrants
who face terrible hardships
											in search of a brighter future,
											to prison inmates who carry
a hell of pain inside their hearts,
											and to those, many of them young,
who cannot find a job,
											I often find myself wondering:
											&quot;Why them and not me?&quot;
											I, myself, was born
in a family of migrants;
											my father, my grandparents,
like many other Italians,
											left for Argentina
											and met the fate of those
who are left with nothing.
											I could have very well ended up
among today&#39;s &quot;discarded&quot; people.
											And that&#39;s why I always ask myself,
deep in my heart:
											&quot;Why them and not me?&quot;

											First and foremost, I would love it
if this meeting could help to remind us
											that we all need each other,
											none of us is an island,
											an autonomous and independent &quot;I,&quot;
separated from the other,
											and we can only build the future
by standing together, including everyone.
											We don’t think about it often,
but everything is connected,
											and we need to restore
our connections to a healthy state.
											Even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart
											against my brother or my sister,
											the open wound that was never cured,
the offense that was never forgiven,
											the rancor that is only going to hurt me,
											are all instances of a fight
that I carry within me,
											a flare deep in my heart
that needs to be extinguished
											before it goes up in flames,
leaving only ashes behind.

											Many of us, nowadays,
											seem to believe that a happy future
is something impossible to achieve.
											While such concerns
must be taken very seriously,
											they are not invincible.
											They can be overcome when we don&#39;t lock
our door to the outside world.
											Happiness can only be discovered
											as a gift of harmony between the whole
and each single component.
											Even science – and you know it
better than I do –
											points to an understanding of reality
											as a place where every element connects
and interacts with everything else.

											And this brings me to my second message.
											How wonderful would it be
											if the growth of scientific
and technological innovation
											would come along with more equality
and social inclusion.
											How wonderful would it be,
while we discover faraway planets,
											to rediscover the needs of the brothers
and sisters orbiting around us.
											How wonderful would it be if solidarity,
											this beautiful and, at times,
inconvenient word,
											were not simply reduced to social work,
											and became, instead, the default attitude
											in political, economic
and scientific choices,
											as well as in the relationships
among individuals, peoples and countries.
											Only by educating people
to a true solidarity
											will we be able to overcome
											the &quot;culture of waste,&quot;
											which doesn&#39;t concern only food and goods
											but, first and foremost, the people
											who are cast aside
by our techno-economic systems
											which, without even realizing it,
											are now putting products
at their core, instead of people.

											Solidarity is a term that many wish
to erase from the dictionary.
											Solidarity, however,
is not an automatic mechanism.
											It cannot be programmed or controlled.
											It is a free response born
from the heart of each and everyone.
											Yes, a free response!
											When one realizes
											that life, even in the middle
of so many contradictions, is a gift,
											that love is the source
and the meaning of life,
											how can they withhold their urge
to do good to another fellow being?

											There is a parable Jesus told
to help us understand the difference

and those who take care of the other.
											I am sure you have heard it before.
It is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.
											When Jesus was asked:
&quot;Who is my neighbor?&quot; -
											namely, &quot;Who should I take care of?&quot; -
											he told this story, the story of a man
											who had been assaulted, robbed,
beaten and abandoned along a dirt road.
											Upon seeing him, a priest and a Levite,
two very influential people of the time,
											walked past him without stopping to help.
											After a while, a Samaritan, a very much
despised ethnicity at the time, walked by.
											Seeing the injured man
lying on the ground,
											he did not ignore him
as if he weren&#39;t even there.
											Instead, he felt compassion for this man,
											which compelled him to act
in a very concrete manner.
											He poured oil and wine
on the wounds of the helpless man,
											brought him to a hostel
											and paid out of his pocket
for him to be assisted.

											The story of the Good Samaritan
is the story of today’s humanity.
											People&#39;s paths are riddled with suffering,
											as everything is centered around money,
and things, instead of people.
											And often there is this habit, by people
who call themselves &quot;respectable,&quot;
											of not taking care of the others,
											thus leaving behind thousands
of human beings, or entire populations,
											on the side of the road.
											Fortunately, there are also those
who are creating a new world
											by taking care of the other,
even out of their own pockets.
											Mother Teresa actually said:
											&quot;One cannot love,
unless it is at their own expense.&quot;

											To Christians,
the future does have a name,
											and its name is Hope.
											Feeling hopeful does not mean
to be optimistically naïve
											and ignore the tragedy humanity is facing.
											Hope is the virtue of a heart
											that doesn&#39;t lock itself into darkness,
that doesn&#39;t dwell on the past,
											does not simply get by in the present,
but is able to see a tomorrow.
											Hope is the door
that opens onto the future.
											Hope is a humble, hidden seed of life
											that, with time,
will develop into a large tree.
											It is like some invisible yeast
that allows the whole dough to grow,
											that brings flavor to all aspects of life.
											And it can do so much,
											because a tiny flicker of light
that feeds on hope
											is enough to shatter
the shield of darkness.
											A single individual
is enough for hope to exist,
											and that individual can be you.
											And then there will be another &quot;you,&quot;
and another &quot;you,&quot;
											and it turns into an &quot;us.&quot;
											And so, does hope begin
when we have an &quot;us?&quot;
											No.
											Hope began with one &quot;you.&quot;
											When there is an &quot;us,&quot;
there begins a revolution.

											The third message
I would like to share today
											is, indeed, about revolution:
the revolution of tenderness.
											And what is tenderness?
											It is the love that comes close
and becomes real.
											It is a movement
that starts from our heart
											and reaches the eyes,
the ears and the hands.
											Tenderness means to use
our eyes to see the other,
											our ears to hear the other,
											to listen to the children, the poor,
those who are afraid of the future.
											To listen also to the silent cry
of our common home,
											of our sick and polluted earth.
											Tenderness means to use
our hands and our heart
											to comfort the other,
											to take care of those in need.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Tenderness is the language
of the young children,
											of those who need the other.
											A child’s love for mom and dad
											grows through their touch, their gaze,
their voice, their tenderness.
											I like when I hear parents
											talk to their babies,
adapting to the little child,
											sharing the same level of communication.
											This is tenderness:
being on the same level as the other.
											God himself descended into Jesus
to be on our level.
											This is the same path
the Good Samaritan took.
											This is the path that Jesus himself took.
											He lowered himself,
											he lived his entire human existence
											practicing the real,
concrete language of love.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Yes, tenderness is the path of choice
											for the strongest,
most courageous men and women.
											Tenderness is not weakness;
it is fortitude.
											It is the path of solidarity,
the path of humility.
											Please, allow me to say it loud and clear:
											the more powerful you are,
											the more your actions
will have an impact on people,
											the more responsible you are
to act humbly.
											If you don’t, your power will ruin you,
and you will ruin the other.
											There is a saying in Argentina:
											&quot;Power is like drinking gin
on an empty stomach.&quot;
											You feel dizzy, you get drunk,
you lose your balance,
											and you will end up hurting yourself
and those around you,
											if you don’t connect your power
with humility and tenderness.
											Through humility and concrete love,
on the other hand,
											power – the highest, the strongest one –
becomes a service, a force for good.

											The future of humankind isn&#39;t exclusively
in the hands of politicians,
											of great leaders, of big companies.
											Yes, they do hold
an enormous responsibility.
											But the future is, most of all,
in the hands of those people
											who recognize the other as a &quot;you&quot;
											and themselves as part of an &quot;us.&quot;
											We all need each other.
											And so, please, think of me
as well with tenderness,
											so that I can fulfill the task
I have been given
											for the good of the other,
											of each and every one, of all of you,
											of all of us.
											Thank you.

","whylisten":"<p>Pope Francis was elected in March 2013, becoming the first Pope from the Americas and from the Southern hemisphere. He was born in 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as Jorge Mario Bergoglio, in a family of Italian immigrants. A Jesuit, he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires and then a Cardinal leading the Argentinian church. Upon election as the 266th Pope, he chose Francis as his papal name in reference to Saint Francis of Assisi.</p><p>A very popular figure who has taken it upon himself to reform the Catholic Church, Pope Francis&#39;s worldview is solidly anchored in humility, simplicity, mercy, social justice, attention to the poor and the dispossessed -- those he says &quot;our culture disposes of like waste&quot; -- and in a critical attitude towards unbridled capitalism and consumerism. He is a strong advocate of global action against climate change, to which he has devoted his powerful 2015 encyclical,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Laudato s&igrave;</em></a>&nbsp;(&quot;Praise be to you&quot;). He invites us to practice &quot;tenderness,&quot; putting ourselves &quot;at the level of the other,&quot; to listen and care. He is committed to interfaith dialogue and is seen as a moral and spiritual authority across the world by many people who aren&#39;t Catholics.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"His Holiness Pope Francis","tags":["children","climate change","Christianity","communication","collaboration","community","compassion","faith","future","humanity","global issues","identity","inequality","love","morality","peace","refugees","religion","social change","technology","society"],"title":"Why the only future worth building includes everyone","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":3031784}]}
