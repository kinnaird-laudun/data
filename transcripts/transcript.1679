											First of all, for those of you who
											are not familiar with my work,
											I create multicultural characters,
											so characters from lots of different backgrounds.
											So before the present is the new future,
											a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family
											that was multi-everything — multi-racial, multi-cultural,
											black and white, Caribbean,
											Irish-American, German-American.
											There was Dominican
music blasting from stereos.
											There were Christians and Jews.
											That&#39;s a long story filled with
											intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame.
											But I was totally immersed in this world
											that was filled with everybody,
											and then I went on to the United Nations school,
											and that just completely —
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I began sort of developing these voices
											and these people,
											all of whom were loosely based
on people I really know,
											and so, for example, in performing them,
											I would really try to inhabit them.
											And for example,
											I don&#39;t really talk like that,
											but that was one of my people,
											and I&#39;m going to bring a few of my friends —
											I think of them as my friends —
											to this stage, in this spirit of the idea
											that the present is the new future,
											in sort of a meta way,
											because I thought about it, and the future, for me,
											what can be so frightening
											is that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming.
											I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true for other people,
											but that notion of thinking about
											how we can understand the future
											and predict outcomes,
											for me, it&#39;s terrifying to not
know what might be coming.
											And so the idea that there are questions
											that I&#39;ve never seen
											that my people are going to answer,
											and some of these characters
have been with me for ages,
											some of them don&#39;t even have names,
											I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen.
											I don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming,
											and all I can do is remind myself
											that I told Chris I&#39;d fly by the seat of my pants,
											and now that I&#39;m up here it sort of feels like
											that dream where you don&#39;t have any pants on,
											and so I suppose I&#39;m going to be
											flying by the seat of my ass.

											Okay.
											Well first of all, I&#39;ll just say

											My name is Lorraine Levine,

											of thank God I&#39;m not wearing the Google Glasses.
											No offense to them. I&#39;m glad that you all enjoy them,

											Hi, um, okay, hi everybody.
											My name is Nereida.
											I just want to say first of all
											that dating is never boring under any circumstance.
											But I am very excited to be here right now,
											so I am just trying to remind myself that,
											you know, like, the purpose
of being here and everything,
											I mean, trying to answer these
questions, it is very exciting.
											But I also, I just need to acknowledge
											that TED is an incredible experience right now
											in the present, like, I just need to say, like,
											Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende!
											Okay, maybe it doesn&#39;t mean,
											of course it means something to you,
											but to me, it&#39;s like, another level, okay?
											Because I&#39;m Latina and I really appreciate the fact
											that there are role models here that I can really,
											I don&#39;t know, I just need to say that.
											That&#39;s incredible to me, and sometimes
when I&#39;m nervous and everything like that,
											I just need to, like, say some affirmations
											that can help me.
											I usually just try to use, like, the three little words
											that always make me feel better:
											Sotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor. (Laughter)
											Just, it really helps me to get grounded.
											Now I can use Allende, Allende, Allende,
											and, you know, I just need to say it, like,
											it&#39;s so incredible to be here, and I knew
that we were going to have these questions.
											I was so nervous and I was thinking
just, like, oh my God, oh my God,
											and reminding me, because
I&#39;ve had, like, some very,
											especially since the last time we were here at TED,
											it was, like, unbelievable,
											and then right after that, like,
											so many crazy things happened, like,
											we ended up going to the White House to perform.
											That was, like, amazing,
											and I&#39;m standing there,
											and I was just like, please don&#39;t say, &quot;Oh my God.&quot;
											Don&#39;t say, &quot;Oh my God.&quot;
											And I just kept saying it: &quot;Oh my God. Oh my God.&quot;
											And, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like,
											President Obama has to come
up here at the same podium,
											and I&#39;m standing here saying, &quot;Oh my God.&quot;
											It&#39;s like, the separation of church and state.
											It&#39;s just, I couldn&#39;t, like, I couldn&#39;t process.
											It was really too much.
											So I think I&#39;ve lost my way.
											But what I wanted to say is that dating, for me,
											you know, as far as I&#39;m concerned,
											however you reproduce, as long
as you&#39;re enjoying yourself
											and it&#39;s with another consenting
asexual — I don&#39;t know.
											You know where I&#39;m going with that.
											Okay, ciao, gracias.

											All right, well first of all, I&#39;mma say,
											you know what I&#39;m saying, I&#39;m
the only dude up here right now.
											My name is Rashid,
											and I never been at TED before,
											you know what I&#39;m saying.
											I think, Sarah Jones, maybe she
didn&#39;t want me to come out last time.
											I don&#39;t know why. You know what I&#39;m saying.
											Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED.
											You know what I&#39;m saying.
											First of all, that I&#39;m in hip hop,
you know what I&#39;m saying.
											I know some of y&#39;all may be not really
											as much into the music,
											but the first way y&#39;all can always know,
											you know what I&#39;m saying, that I&#39;m in hip hop,
											is &#39;cos I hold the microphone
											in an official emcee posture.
											Y&#39;all can see that right there.
											That&#39;s how you hold it.
											All right, so you get your little tutorial right there.
											But when Sarah Jones told me
we was gonna come up here,
											I was like, betch, you know what I&#39;m saying,
											TED is real fly, I got a whole lot of dope,
											you know what I&#39;m saying,
shit going on and everything,
											but she was like, yeah,
											we&#39;re going to have to answer,
like, some random questions,
											just like, and I was like, what the hell is that?
											You know what I&#39;m saying, just stand up there
											and answer some random questions?
											I don&#39;t want to,
											I mean, it&#39;s like an intellectual stop-and-frisk.
											You know what I&#39;m saying? (Laughter)
											I don&#39;t want to be standing up there just
											all getting interrogated and whatnot.
											That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to leave behind
											in New York. You know what I&#39;m saying?
											So anyway, I would have to say
my top five songs right now
											is all out of my own personal catalogue,
											you know what I mean?
											So if you want to know more about that,
											you know what I&#39;m saying,
											we could talk about the anti-piracy and all that,
											but as far as I&#39;m concerned,
											you know, I believe in creative commons,
											and I think it&#39;s really important that, you know,
											that needs to be sustainable and everything,
											and I mean, as far as I&#39;m concerned,
											I mean, this right here,
											this environment, I would like to sustain.
											You know what I mean?
											But I&#39;m just saying, if y&#39;all are interested
											in the top five songs, you need to holler at me.
											You know what I&#39;m saying?
											Aight? In the future or the present. Yeah.
											Enjoy the rest of it.

											please, you have to eat that, you know,

											What has changed? Okay, it&#39;s like,
											I have to think about that.
											&quot;What has changed now that women run the world?&quot;
											First of all,
											I really, like, I just want to say,
											and my name is Bella,
											I just want to, like, identify myself,
											that, like, as a feminist,
											I, like, I really find that, like,
											because I was born in the &#39;90s,
											and, like, there were a lot of women who were
											as far as feminism was concerned,
											like, maybe they didn&#39;t understand that, like,
											a feminist like me, like,
											I don&#39;t think it&#39;s required that you have to have
											a certain kind of voice,
											or, like, a certain way of presenting yourself
											to be feminist, because I think that, like,
											feminism can be really hot,
											and I think actually that it&#39;s really vital and important.
											Like, the quotation I&#39;m wearing is from, like,
											Gloria Steinem,
											and, like, I&#39;m named Bella for, like, Bella Abzug,
											who&#39;s, like, obviously, like, a really
important feminist from, like, history,
											and like, I just think that those women, like,
											really represent, like, that you can, like,
											be vital and, like, amazing,
											like, a-mazing,
											and you don&#39;t have to wear, like,
											an Eileen Fisher caftan,
											just to, like, prove that you are a feminist.
											Like, not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that,
											but my mom, she&#39;s like, like,
											why do you have to wear pants that, like,
											objectify your body? I like my pants.
											Like, I like my voice.
											Like, she&#39;s like, why do you have to talk like —
											Talk like what? Like, I&#39;m expressing myself,
											and I think that we have to, like,
											reach out, like, not only across, like,
											the different generations of feminists,
											but also across the, like, vocal ranges,
											so that, like, we,
											because otherwise it&#39;s just, like,
											restriculous within feminism,
											which is just, like, a word that I created
											that means, like, so strict it&#39;s ridiculous.
											So that&#39;s my feeling about that.
											You guys are a-mazing, by the way.

											Yeah, you know what,

											First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate
											that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd,
											a pretty orderly group.
											And, you know, I just have to say,
											the whole thing with baldness,
											and, you know, here&#39;s the thing.
											As long as the woman, in my case —

											do whatever you want to do, I don&#39;t
have any problem with anybody,
											enjoy yourself, LGBTQLMNOP. All right?
											But as far as I&#39;m concerned,
											attractiveness,
											women don&#39;t really care
											as much as you think they do
											about the, you know.
											I mean, I remember hearing this woman.
											She loved her husband, it was the sweetest thing.
											It&#39;s a pretty young girl, you know?
											And this guy&#39;s older.
											And, you know, she said she would love him
											even if he had snow on the roof
											or even if melted and disappeared altogether.
											As far as I&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s about the love.
											Am I right, or am I right?
											So that&#39;s it. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s it.
											I don&#39;t got nothing more to say.
											Keep your noses clean.

											My name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that.
											I&#39;m a member of the Blackfeet Nation.

											and no, even though it would have seemed
											like an obvious choice,
											no, I did not go into politics.
											Tough crowd.
											(Laughter)
											But I always like to just let people know
											when they ask about race or those kinds of things,
											you know, as a member of
the First Nations community,
											you know, I&#39;m probably
											not your typical guy.
											For example, in addition to being an activist,
											I&#39;m also a professional stand-up comedian.
											(Laughter)
											And, you know, I&#39;m most popular
											on college and university campuses.
											You know, whenever they want to do a diversity day,
											or hey-we&#39;re-not-all-white week,
											then I&#39;m there. (Laughter)
											Do I think there will ever be a post-racial world?
											I think, really, I can&#39;t talk about race
											without remembering that it is a construct
											in certain respects,
											but also that, you know,
											until we redress the wrongs of the past,
											we&#39;re going to be turned around.
											I don&#39;t care if the present is the new future.
											I think there&#39;s a lot of great people here at TED
											who are working to address that,

											So we&#39;re talking about what&#39;s the most popular diet?
											I&#39;m gonna start off by telling y&#39;all that
											this is my first time here at TED.
											I might not be your typical person
											you find on this stage.
											My dental work not as nice as some people.
											But I made Sarah Jones promise
											she gonna bring me this time,
											&#39;cause she didn&#39;t bring me before,
											but you know, I just want to say,
											there&#39;s a lot of things more important
											than counting calories,
											and as somebody living on the streets in New York,
											and getting to come here,
hear y&#39;all ideas worth spreading,
											I want to tell y&#39;all I believe in this idea
											that the present is the new future,
											that where you sit, you create everything
											that&#39;s gonna come, for better or worse.
											And for me, I think homeless
											is the wrong word for it anyway.
											You know, I might not have me no place
											to lay my head at night,
											but that just makes me houseless.
											I have me a home. You do too.
											Find it and try to find yourself in there.
											Make sure you know,
											it&#39;s not just about virtual reality in space.
											That&#39;s wonderful, but it&#39;s also about
											the actual reality here on Earth.
											How are people living today?
											How can you be part of the solution?
											Thank y&#39;all for thinking about that
											right now in the present moment
											to influence the future.
											I appreciate it. Bye-bye.
