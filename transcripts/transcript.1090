<meta content='Filmmaker Penelope Jagessar Chaffer was curious about the chemicals she was exposed to while pregnant: Could they affect her unborn child? So she asked scientist Tyrone Hayes to brief her on one he studied closely: atrazine, a herbicide used on corn.

											Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there&#39;s a doctor in the house.
											No, I&#39;m just joking.
											It&#39;s interesting, because it was six years ago
											when I was pregnant with my first child
											that I discovered
											that the most commonly used preservative
											in baby care products
											mimics estrogen
											when it gets into the human body.
											Now it&#39;s very easy actually
											to get a chemical compound from products
											into the human body through the skin.
											And these preservatives had been found
											in breast cancer tumors.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That was the start of my journey
											to make this film, &quot;Toxic Baby.&quot;
											And it doesn&#39;t take much time
											to discover some really astonishing statistics
											with this issue.
											One is that you and I all have
											between 30 to 50,000 chemicals
											in our bodies
											that our grandparents didn&#39;t have.
											And many of these chemicals
											are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents
											of chronic childhood disease
											that we&#39;re seeing across industrialized nations.
											I&#39;ll show you some statistics.
											So for example, in the United Kingdom,
											the incidence of childhood leukemia
											has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.
											Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.
											In Canada, we&#39;re now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.
											That&#39;s a four-fold increase.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Again, similar story around the world.
											In the United States,
											probably the most astonishing statistic
											is a 600 percent increase
											in autism and autistic spectrum disorders
											and other learning disabilities.
											Again, we&#39;re seeing that trend
											across Europe, across North America.
											And in Europe,
											there&#39;s certain parts of Europe,
											where we&#39;re seeing a four-fold increase
											in certain genital birth defects.
											Interestingly, one of those birth defects
											has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.
											So a real skyrocketing
											of chronic childhood disease
											that includes other things
											like obesity and juvenile diabetes,
											premature puberty.

									<p>
											So it&#39;s interesting for me,
											when I&#39;m looking for someone who can really talk to me
											and talk to an audience about these things,
											that probably one of the most important people in the world
											who can discuss toxicity in babies
											is expert in frogs.

											Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well
											that I would be talking about pesticides,
											that I&#39;d be talking about public health,
											because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.
											(Laughter)
											Frogs.
											In fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue
											was sort of a surprise as well
											when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world
											and they asked me if I would evaluate
											how atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.
											It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product
											for the largest chemical company in the world.
											It&#39;s the number one contaminant
											of groundwater, drinking water, rain water.
											In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union,
											but in that same year,
											the United States EPA re-registered the compound.

											to very low levels of atrazine — 0.1 parts per billion —
											that it produced animals that look like this.
											These are the dissected gonads of an animal
											that has two testes, two ovaries,
											another large testis, more ovaries,
											which is not normal ...
											(Laughter)
											even for amphibians.
											In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog
											showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.
											And you can see these large, yolked-up eggs
											bursting through the surface of this male&#39;s testes.
											Now my wife tells me, and I&#39;m sure Penelope can as well,
											that there&#39;s nothing more painful than childbirth —
											which that I&#39;ll never experience, I can&#39;t really argue that —
											but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle
											would probably be somewhere in the top five.

											In recent studies that we&#39;ve published,
											we&#39;ve shown that some of these animals when they&#39;re exposed to atrazine,
											some of the males grow up
											and completely become females.
											So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.
											And not only do these genetic males mate with other males,
											they actually have the capacity to lay eggs
											even though they&#39;re genetic males.
											What we proposed,
											and what we&#39;ve now generated support for,
											is that what atrazine is doing
											is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.
											Normally the testes should make testosterone,
											the male hormone.
											But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme,
											the machinery if you will, aromatase,
											that converts testosterone into estrogen.
											And as a result, these exposed males
											lose their testosterone, they&#39;re chemically castrated,
											and they&#39;re subsequently feminized
											because now they&#39;re making the female hormone.

									<p>
											Now this is what brought me to the human-related issues.
											Because it turns out
											that the number one cancer in women, breast cancer,
											is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.
											So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast,
											aromatase converts androgens into estrogens,
											and that estrogen turns on or promotes
											the growth of that cancer
											so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.
											In fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer
											that the latest treatment for breast cancer
											is a chemical called letrozole,
											which blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen,
											so that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn&#39;t grow into a tumor.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now what&#39;s interesting is, of course,
											that we&#39;re still using 80 million pounds of atrazine,
											the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite —
											turns on aromatase, increases estrogen
											and promotes tumors in rats
											and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.
											What&#39;s interesting is, in fact,
											the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine,
											the breast cancer promoter,
											now sells us the blocker — the exact same company.
											And so I find it interesting
											that instead of treating this disease
											by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it,
											we simply respond
											by putting more chemicals into the environment.

											PJC: So speaking of estrogen,
											one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film
											is something called bisphenol A, BPA,
											which has been in the news recently.
											It&#39;s a plasticizer.
											It&#39;s a compound that&#39;s found in polycarbonate plastic,
											which is what baby bottles are made out of.
											And what&#39;s interesting about BPA
											is that it&#39;s such a potent estrogen
											that it was actually once considered for use
											as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.
											And there have been many, many, many studies that have shown
											that BPA leaches from babies&#39; bottles
											into the formula, into the milk,
											and therefore into the babies.
											So we&#39;re dosing our babies,
											our newborns, our infants,
											with a synthetic estrogen.

									<p>
											Now two weeks ago or so,
											the European Union passed a law
											banning the use of BPA
											in babies&#39; bottles and sippy cups.
											And for those of you who are not parents,
											sippy cups are those little plastic things
											that your child graduates to after using bottles.
											But just two weeks before that,
											the U.S. Senate refused to even debate
											the banning of BPA
											in babies&#39; bottles and sippy cups.
											So it really makes you realize
											the onus on parents
											to have to look at this and regulate this and police this
											in their own lives
											and how astonishing that is.

											TH: And what Penelope says here
											is even more true.
											For those of you who don&#39;t know, we&#39;re in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.
											Scientists agree now.
											We are losing species from the Earth
											faster than the dinosaurs disappeared,
											and leading that loss are amphibians.
											80 percent of all amphibians
											are threatened and in come decline.
											And I believe, many scientists believe
											that pesticides are an important part of that decline.
											In part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive
											because they don&#39;t have protection from contaminants in the water —
											no eggshells, no membranes
											and no placenta.
											In fact, our invention — by &quot;our&quot; I mean we mammals —
											one of our big inventions was the placenta.
											But we also start out as aquatic organisms.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But it turns out that this ancient structure
											that separates us from other animals, the placenta,
											cannot evolve or adapt fast enough
											because of the rate that we&#39;re generating new chemicals
											that it&#39;s never seen before.
											The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine,
											show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.
											Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.

											Of those rats that don&#39;t abort,
											atrazine causes prostate disease
											in the pups so the sons
											are born with an old man&#39;s disease.
											Of those that don&#39;t abort,
											atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development
											in the exposed daughters in utero,
											so that their breast don&#39;t develop properly.
											And as a result, when those rats grow up,
											their pups experience retarded growth and development
											because they can&#39;t make enough milk to nourish their pups.

											So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine
											that its grandmother was exposed to.
											And given the life of many of these chemicals,

											And this is not just philosophical, it&#39;s already known,
											that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen,

											and obesity and diabetes

											This is our issue,

											and then we end up dumping it and dumping them
											into our unborn children.

											TH: One of this things that&#39;s exciting and appropriate

											&#39;When the revolution starts, we&#39;ve got your back.&#39;&quot;

											But for the men here, I want to say
											it&#39;s not just women and children that are at risk.
											And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine,
											the testes are full of holes and spaces,
											because the hormone imbalance,
											instead of allowing sperm to be generated,
											such as in the testis here,
											the testicular tubules end up empty
											and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.
											It&#39;s not just my work in amphibians,
											but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe,
											holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America
											and in rats, an absence of sperm
											in the testicular tubules as well.
											And of course, we don&#39;t do these experiments in humans,

											up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active
											are present in the urine of these men.
											Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.

											It shouldn&#39;t come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife
											are also a warning to us,
											just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.
											As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda,
											the agricultural runoff from this crop,
											which goes into these buckets,
											is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.
											Now if I told the men in this village
