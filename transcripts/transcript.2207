											I opened a blind man&#39;s head.
											I didn&#39;t make him think or reflect —
I cracked his head open, literally.

holding onto my shoulder,

there was between us,

											The truth is, when I started working
at the institute for the blind,
											I was surprised by a lot of things.
											A lot of the things they did,
I never imagined they could:
											they swam, did exercise, played cards.
											They drank mate, and could pour it
											without burning themselves in the process.

											But when I saw them playing soccer —
											that was amazing.
											They had a dirt field,
rusty goalposts and broken nets.
											The blind who attended the institute
would play their games there,
											just like I did at a field near my house.
											But they played without being able to see.
											The ball made a sound
so they could locate it.
											They had a guide
behind the rival team&#39;s goal
											to know where to kick the ball.
											And they used eye masks.
											There were guys
who could still see a little,
											and they wore eye masks
so everyone was equal.

											When I was more at ease with them,
I asked for a mask myself.
											I put it on and tried to play.
											I had played soccer all my life.
											This is where it got even more amazing:
											within two seconds, I didn&#39;t know
where I was standing.
											I had studied physical education
because I loved high performance.

											I started working
at the institute by chance.
											My other job was with the Argentinian
National Rowing Team,
											and I felt that was my thing.
											Here, everything was twice as hard.
											I&#39;ll never forget the first day
I did the warm-up with the team.
											I lined them up in front of me —
											I used to do that with the rowing team —
											and I said, &quot;OK, everyone
bend down,&quot; going like this.
											When I looked up, two guys were seated,
											three were lying down

											How could I do here
the same things I was doing there?
											It took me a while.
											I started looking for tools
to learn from them,
											from the teachers who worked with them.
											I learned I couldn&#39;t explain a play
on a chalkboard like a coach does,
											but I could use a plastic tray
and some bottle caps
											so they could follow me by way of touch.
											I also learned they could run on a track
											if I ran with them, holding a rope.
											So we started looking for volunteers
to help us run with them.
