<title>Jennifer Brea: What happens when you have a disease doctors can&#39;t diagnose | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Five years ago, TED Fellow Jennifer Brea became progressively ill with myalgic encephalomyelitis, commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating illness that severely impairs normal activities and on bad days makes even the rustling of bed sheets unbearable. In this poignant talk, Brea describes the obstacles she&#39;s encountered in seeking treatment for her condition, whose root causes and physical effects we don&#39;t fully understand, as well as her mission to document through film the lives of patients that medicine struggles to treat." />

<meta content="Five years ago, TED Fellow Jennifer Brea became progressively ill with myalgic encephalomyelitis, commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating illness that severely impairs normal activities and on bad days makes even the rustling of bed sheets unbearable. In this poignant talk, Brea describes the obstacles she's encountered in seeking treatment for her condition, whose root causes and physical effects we don't fully understand, as well as her mission to document through film the lives of patients that medicine struggles to treat." itemprop='description'>

											Then one day I had
a fever of 104.7 degrees.
											I probably should have gone to the doctor,
											but I&#39;d never really been sick in my life,
											and I knew that usually,
if you have a virus,
											you stay home and you make
some chicken soup,
											and in a few days,
everything will be fine.
											But this time it wasn&#39;t fine.
											After the fever broke,
											for three weeks I was so dizzy,
I couldn&#39;t leave my house.
											I would walk straight into door frames.
											I had to hug the walls
just to make it to the bathroom.
											That spring I got infection
after infection,
											and every time I went to the doctor,
											he said there was absolutely
nothing wrong.
											He had his laboratory tests,
											which always came back normal.
											All I had were my symptoms,
											which I could describe,
											but no one else can see.

											When my doctor diagnosed me
with conversion disorder,
											he was invoking a lineage
of ideas about women&#39;s bodies
											that are over 2,500 years old.
											The Roman physician Galen thought
											that hysteria was caused
by sexual deprivation
											in particularly passionate women.
											The Greeks thought the uterus
would literally dry up
											and wander around the body
in search of moisture,
											pressing on internal organs —
											yes —
											causing symptoms from extreme emotions
											to dizziness and paralysis.
											The cure was marriage and motherhood.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											These ideas went largely unchanged
for several millennia until the 1880s,
											when neurologists tried to modernize
the theory of hysteria.
											Sigmund Freud developed a theory
											that the unconscious mind
could produce physical symptoms
											when dealing with memories or emotions
											too painful for the conscious
mind to handle.
											It converted these emotions
into physical symptoms.
											This meant that men
could now get hysteria,
											but of course women were still
the most susceptible.

									<p>
											When I began investigating
the history of my own disease,
											I was amazed to find how deep
these ideas still run.
											In 1934,
											198 doctors, nurses and staff
at the Los Angeles County General Hospital
											became seriously ill.
											They had muscle weakness, stiffness
in the neck and back, fevers —
											all of the same symptoms
I had when I first got diagnosed.
											Doctors thought
it was a new form of polio.
											Since then, there have been more
than 70 outbreaks documented
											around the world,
											of a strikingly similar
post-infectious disease.
											All of these outbreaks have tended
to disproportionately affect women,
											and in time, when doctors failed to find
the one cause of the disease,
											they thought that these outbreaks
were mass hysteria.

									<p>
											Why has this idea had such staying power?
											I do think it has to do with sexism,
											but I also think that fundamentally,
doctors want to help.
											They want to know the answer,
											and this category allows doctors to treat
what would otherwise be untreatable,
											to explain illnesses
that have no explanation.
											The problem is that this
can cause real harm.
											In the 1950s, a psychiatrist
named Eliot Slater
											studied a cohort of 85 patients
who had been diagnosed with hysteria.
											Nine years later, 12 of them were dead
and 30 had become disabled.
											Many had undiagnosed conditions
like multiple sclerosis,
											epilepsy, brain tumors.
											In 1980, hysteria was officially
renamed &quot;conversion disorder.&quot;
											When my neurologist gave me
that diagnosis in 2012,
											he was echoing Freud&#39;s words verbatim,
											and even today,
											women are 2 to 10 times more likely
to receive that diagnosis.

											The problem with the theory of hysteria
or psychogenic illness
											is that it can never be proven.
											It is by definition
the absence of evidence,
											and in the case of ME,
											psychological explanations
have held back biological research.
											All around the world, ME is one
of the least funded diseases.
											In the US, we spend each year
roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient,
											250 dollars per MS patient
											and just 5 dollars per year
per ME patient.
											This was not just lightning.
											I was not just unlucky.
											The ignorance surrounding my disease
has been a choice,
											a choice made by the institutions
that were supposed to protect us.

sometimes runs in families,

											This issue is much bigger
than just my disease.
											When I first got sick,
											old friends were reaching out to me.
											I soon found myself a part
of a cohort of women in their late 20s

											Here&#39;s why this worries me:
											since the 1950s, rates of many
autoimmune diseases
											have doubled to tripled.
											Forty-five percent of patients
who are eventually diagnosed
											with a recognized autoimmune disease
											are initially told they&#39;re hypochondriacs.
											Like the hysteria of old,
this has everything to do with gender
											and with whose stories we believe.
											Seventy-five percent
of autoimmune disease patients are women,
											and in some diseases,
it&#39;s as high as 90 percent.
											Even though these diseases
disproportionately affect women,
											they are not women&#39;s diseases.
											ME affects children
and ME affects millions of men.
											And as one patient told me,
											we get it coming and going —
											if you&#39;re a woman, you&#39;re told
you&#39;re exaggerating your symptoms,
											but if you&#39;re a guy, you&#39;re told
to be strong, to buck up.
											And men may even have
a more difficult time getting diagnosed.

											Here&#39;s the good part:
											despite everything, I still have hope.
											So many diseases were once
thought of as psychological
											until science uncovered
their biological mechanisms.
											Patients with epilepsy
could be forcibly institutionalized
											until the EEG was able to measure
abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
											Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed
as hysterical paralysis
											until the CAT scan and the MRI
discovered brain lesions.
											And recently, we used to think
											that stomach ulcers
were just caused by stress,
											until we discovered
that H. pylori was the culprit.
											ME has never benefited
from the kind of science
											that other diseases have had,
											but that&#39;s starting to change.
											In Germany, scientists are starting
to find evidence of autoimmunity,
											and in Japan, of brain inflammation.
											In the US, scientists at Stanford
are finding abnormalities
											in energy metabolism
											that are 16 standard deviations
away from normal.
											And in Norway, researchers
are running a phase-3 clinical trial
											on a cancer drug that in some patients
causes complete remission.

											What also gives me hope
											is the resilience of patients.
											Online we came together,
											and we shared our stories.
											We devoured what research there was.
											We experimented on ourselves.
											We became our own scientists
and our own doctors
											because we had to be.
											And slowly I added five percent here,
five percent there,
											until eventually, on a good day,
											I was able to leave my home.
											I still had to make ridiculous choices:
											Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes,
or will I wash my hair today?

After reviewing 9,000 published journal articles, an IOM committee concluded that ME/CFS — the term used by U.S. agencies — is a \"serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease that often can profoundly affect the lives of patients.\" They explicitly state that ME/CFS is a physical, not mental, disorder. The committee estimated that up to 2.5 million Americans live with ME/CFS, costing the U.S. economy up to $24 billion each year. The report concludes by calling for large increases in research funding.
