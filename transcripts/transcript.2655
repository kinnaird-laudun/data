<title>WorkLife with Adam Grant: How to love criticism | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What if you could tell your co-workers what you really think of them? At the world&#39;s most successful hedge fund, everyone is rated and ranked constantly -- in front of everyone. They&#39;ve figured out how to embrace negative feedback, and they swear it&#39;s essential to their success. Adam Grant shows how you can learn to take criticism well -- and get better at dishing it out. This episode is brought to you by Bonobos, Accenture, JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co., and Warby Parker.

											When I was 26 years old,
barely out of grad school,
											I was asked to come teach
a half-day class about motivation.
											I was excited for it.
											And then I found out my audience
would be generals and colonels
											in the US Air Force.
											I was way underqualified.
											And I wanted to back out,
but it was too late.
											So I walked in,
											and I was staring at a room
full of people twice my age,
											wearing full military garb
with all their medals on display.
											They had nicknames like Gunner,
Striker and Stealth.
											By the end of the first hour,
I felt like I was bombing.
											And sure enough, in the reviews
they wrote after class,
											they bombed me.

did gain useful insight.&quot;

											It felt like a punch in the stomach.
											And I couldn&#39;t get it out of my head.
											So I did what any self-respecting
organizational psychologist would do:
											I started studying why it&#39;s often
soul-crushing to receive criticism.
											And whether we could
actually learn to like it.

											This is WorkLife, my TED podcast.
											I study how to make work not suck.
											Organizations like Google,
the NBA and the Gates Foundation
											have invited me in to help
make jobs more meaningful,
											teams more creative
and cultures more collaborative.
											In this show, I&#39;m inviting myself in
to some truly unusual places,
											where they&#39;ve mastered something
I wish everyone else knew about work.
											Today, the art and science of criticism.

											AG: We&#39;ll hear more from Kiran later.
											But right now, I want you to imagine
you&#39;re Kiran, right in that moment.
											Think about what happens
when you get criticized.
											Like, physically: your shoulders tighten,
your breath gets shallower.
											Negative feedback sets off alarm bells.
											It actually touches a nerve in your body.
											And psychologically?
											Your mind races.
											You start to put up shields
and mount a counterattack.
											If you were a peacock, you&#39;d strut.
											If you were an ape, you&#39;d beat your chest.
											But humans have another kind of reaction.
											There was a study a few decades ago
											that said our ego can get
so defensive in these situations
											that it becomes its own little
totalitarian regime.
											It starts to control the flow
of information to our brains
											the way a dictator controls the media.
											Think about that.
											Your own ego is censoring what you hear.
											But if we never hear criticism,
we&#39;ll never improve.
											What would it be like in a place
											where people constantly
criticize each other —
											and crave that kind
of feedback for themselves
											in order to make everyone better?

											When I was in college,

even seen that score before.
											Anyway, when you&#39;re flipping
and twisting in mid-air,

your own performance.

											AG: That&#39;s the goal.
											But if you&#39;re like most people,
											reflection gets hijacked
by your inner dictator,
											who immediately goes
into denial and attack.
											We need a way to take
a more honest look in the mirror.
											In the moment, that&#39;s hard to do.
											So in psychology, we have a fun way
of making you a little more aware
											of how you appear to others.
											Imagine that you&#39;re sitting at a computer
to take a timed, multiple-choice test.
											The instructions say
to answer question after question
											until a timer goes off.
											But what we haven&#39;t told you
is that we&#39;re recording your keyboard.
											So if you submit an answer
after the timer, we know you&#39;re cheating.
											It turns out you&#39;re significantly
less likely to cheat
											if there&#39;s a mirror in the room.
											It reminds you to reflect
on how your behavior will look to others.

											At Bridgewater, Ray is constantly
trying to look in the mirror,
											so he can see himself
the way others see him.
											Psychologists often talk
about a second score.
											The idea being that you can&#39;t control
											your unprepared, long-winded
meeting performance,
											the D-minus is done,
that already happened.
											The only thing you can do then is say,
											&quot;Alright, I can&#39;t control
that first score,
											I can control the second, which is
how well did I take the first score.&quot;
											Even if I got a D-minus
for my performance,
											I can get an A-plus for how
I took the feedback of my performance.
											Do you give yourself those kinds
of explicit evaluations?

											AG: A second score.
											Every time I get feedback,
											I rate myself now
on how well I took the feedback.
											That&#39;s a habit we can all develop.
											When someone gives you feedback,
they&#39;ve already evaluated you.
											So it helps to remind yourself
that the main thing they&#39;re judging now
											is whether you&#39;re open or defensive.
											You don&#39;t always realize
when you&#39;re being defensive.
											So call on your challenge network.
											Ask them to give you a second score, too.
											&quot;How did I come across
when you gave me feedback?&quot;
											And then really listen to what they say.
											And respond by saying thank you.
