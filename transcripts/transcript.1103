											TED has already persuaded me
to change my life in one small way,
											by persuading me to change
the opening of my speech.
											I love this idea of engagement.
											So, when you leave here today,
											I&#39;m going to ask you
to engage or re-engage
											with some of the most important
people in your lives:
											your brothers and sisters.
											It can be a profoundly
life-affirming thing to do,
											even if it isn&#39;t always easy.

											This is a man named Elliot,
											for whom things were very difficult.
											Elliot was a drunk.
											He spent most of his life
battling alcoholism,
											depression, morphine addiction,
											and that life ended
when he was just 34 years old.
											What made things harder for Elliot
is that his last name was Roosevelt.
											And he could never quite
get past the comparisons
											with his big brother Teddy,
											for whom things always seemed
to come a little bit easier.

											It wasn&#39;t easy being Bobby, either.
											He was also the sibling of a president.
											But he adored his brother, Jack.
											He fought for him,
											he worked for him.
											And when Jack died, he bled for him, too.
											In the years that followed,
Bobby would smile,
											but it seemed labored.
											He&#39;d lose himself in his work,
											but it seemed tortured.
											Bobby&#39;s own death, so similar to John&#39;s,
											seems somehow fitting.
											John Kennedy was robbed of his young life;
											Bobby seemed almost
to have been relieved of his.

											There may be no relationship
that effects us more profoundly,
											that&#39;s closer, finer, harder,
											sweeter, happier, sadder,
											more filled with joy or fraught with woe
											than the relationship we have
with our brothers and sisters.
											There&#39;s power in the sibling bond.
											There&#39;s pageantry.
											There&#39;s petulance, too,
											as when Neil Bush,
											sibling of both a president
and a governor, famously griped,
											&quot;I&#39;ve lost patience for being compared
to my older brothers,&quot;
											as if Jeb and George W
were somehow responsible
											for the savings and loan scandal
and the messy divorce
											that marked Neil in the public eye.

											But more important
than all of these things,
											the sibling bond can be
a thing of abiding love.
											Our parents leave us too early,
											our spouse and our children
come along too late.
											Our siblings are the only ones
who are with us
											for the entire ride.
											Over the arc of decades,
there may be nothing
											that defines us and forms us
more powerfully
											than our relationship
with our sisters and brothers.
											It was true for me,
											it&#39;s true for your children
											and if you have siblings,
it&#39;s true for you, too.

											I don&#39;t know what he thought his life
would be like on Saturday mornings
											when he had four sons,

disturbed on a Saturday morning

											One of the same studies I looked at
both here and in the book found that,

											The most common favorite

											Firstborns across history have tended
to be bigger and healthier

they got on food

											Firstborns are also
vaccinated more reliably

											Kids are born with a very innate sense
of right and wrong,
											of a fair deal versus an unfair one,
											and this teaches them powerful lessons.
											Do you want to know how powerfully encoded
fairness is in the human genome?
											We process that phenomenon
											through the same lobe in our brain
that processes disgust,
											meaning we react to the idea
of somebody being cheated
											the same way we react to putrefied meat.

											All of these dramas played out day to day,
											moment to moment,
											serve as a real-time,
total-immersion exercise for life.
											Siblings teach each other conflict
avoidance and conflict resolution,
											when to stand up for themselves,
											when to stand down;
											they learn love,
											loyalty, honesty, sharing,
caring, compromise,
											the disclosure of secrets
and much more important,
											the keeping of confidences.

											I listen to my young daughters —
aren’t they adorable? —
											I listen to my young daughters
talking late into the night,
											the same way my parents, no doubt,
listened to my brothers and me talking,
											and sometimes I intervene,
but usually I don&#39;t.
											They&#39;re part of a conversation
I am not part of,
											nobody else in the world is part of,
											and it&#39;s a conversation
that can and should go on
											for the rest of their lives.
											From this will come a sense of constancy,
											a sense of having a permanent
traveling companion,
											somebody with whom they road-tested life
											before they ever had to get out
and travel it on their own.

											Brothers and sisters aren&#39;t
the sine qua non of a happy life;
											plenty of adult sibling
relationships are fatally broken
											and need to be abandoned
for the sanity of everybody involved.
											And only-children, throughout history,
have shown themselves
											to be creatively, brilliantly capable
											of getting their socialization
and comradeship skills
											through friends, through cousins,
through classmates.
											But having siblings and not
making the most of those bonds
											is, I believe, folly of the first order.
											If relationships are broken
and are fixable, fix them.
											If they work, make them even better.
											Failing to do so is a little like having
a thousand acres of fertile farmland
											and never planting it.
											Yes, you can always get your food
at the supermarket,
											but think what you&#39;re
allowing to lie fallow.
											Life is short, it&#39;s finite,
and it plays for keeps.
											Siblings may be among the richest harvests
of the time we have here.
