<title>Mikko Hypponen: How the NSA betrayed the world&#39;s trust -- time to act | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Recent events have highlighted, underlined and bolded the fact that the United States is performing blanket surveillance on any foreigner whose data passes through an American entity -- whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not. This means that, essentially, every international user of the internet is being watched, says Mikko Hypponen. An important rant, wrapped with a plea: to find alternative solutions to using American companies for the world&#39;s information needs." />

<meta content="Recent events have highlighted, underlined and bolded the fact that the United States is performing blanket surveillance on any foreigner whose data passes through an American entity — whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not. This means that, essentially, every international user of the internet is being watched, says Mikko Hypponen.

											The two most likely largest inventions
											of our generation
											are the Internet and the mobile phone.
											They&#39;ve changed the world.
											However, largely to our surprise,
											they also turned out to be the perfect tools
											for the surveillance state.
											It turned out that the capability
											to collect data, information and connections
											about basically any of us and all of us
											is exactly what we&#39;ve been hearing
											throughout of the summer
through revelations and leaks
											about Western intelligence agencies,
											mostly U.S. intelligence agencies,
											watching over the rest of the world.

											We&#39;ve heard about these starting with the
											revelations from June 6.
											Edward Snowden started leaking information,
											top secret classified information,
											from the U.S. intelligence agencies,
											and we started learning about things like PRISM
											and XKeyscore and others.
											And these are examples of the kinds of programs
											U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,
											against the whole rest of the world.

											And if you look back about the forecasts
											on surveillance by George Orwell,
											well it turns out that
											George Orwell was an optimist.
											(Laughter)
											We are right now seeing a much larger scale
											of tracking of individual citizens
											than he could have ever imagined.

											And this here is the infamous
											NSA data center in Utah.
											Due to be opened very soon,
											it will be both a supercomputing center
											and a data storage center.
											You could basically imagine it has a large hall
											filled with hard drives storing data
											they are collecting.
											And it&#39;s a pretty big building.
											How big? Well, I can give you the numbers —
											140,000 square meters —
											but that doesn&#39;t really tell you very much.
											Maybe it&#39;s better to imagine it as a comparison.
											You think about the largest IKEA store
											you&#39;ve ever been in.
											This is five times larger.
											How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?
											Right? It&#39;s pretty big.
											We estimate that just the electricity bill
											for running this data center
											is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
											And this kind of wholesale surveillance
											means that they can collect our data
											and keep it basically forever,

											because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right

											They can monitor foreigners

											But don&#39;t get me wrong:
											There are actually types
of surveillance that are okay.
											I love freedom, but even I agree
											that some surveillance is fine.
											If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer,
											or they&#39;re trying to catch a drug lord
											or trying to prevent a school shooting,
											and they have leads and they have suspects,
											then it&#39;s perfectly fine for them
to tap the suspect&#39;s phone,
											and to intercept his Internet communications.
											I&#39;m not arguing that at all,
											but that&#39;s not what programs like PRISM are about.
											They are not about doing surveillance on people
											that they have reason
to suspect of some wrongdoings.
											They&#39;re about doing surveillance on people
											they know are innocent.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the four main arguments
											supporting surveillance like this,
											well, the first of all is that whenever you start
											discussing about these revelations,
											there will be naysayers trying to minimize
											the importance of these revelations, saying that
											we knew all this already,
											we knew it was happening, there&#39;s nothing new here.
											And that&#39;s not true. Don&#39;t let anybody tell you
											that we knew this already,
because we did not know this already.
											Our worst fears might have been something like this,
											but we didn&#39;t know this was happening.
											Now we know for a fact it&#39;s happening.
											We didn&#39;t know about this.
We didn&#39;t know about PRISM.
											We didn&#39;t know about XKeyscore.
We didn&#39;t know about Cybertrans.
											We didn&#39;t know about DoubleArrow.
											We did not know about Skywriter —
											all these different programs
											run by U.S. intelligence agencies.
											But now we do.

								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And we did not know
											that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes
											such as infiltrating standardization bodies
											to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.
											And what that means
											is that you take something which is secure,
											an encryption algorithm which is so secure
											that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,
											nobody can decrypt that file.
											Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,
											it&#39;s going to take millions of years.
											So that&#39;s basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.
											You take something which is that good
											and then you weaken it on purpose,
											making all of us less secure as an end result.
											A real-world equivalent would be that
											intelligence agencies would force
											some secret pin code into every single house alarm
											so they could get into every single house
											because, you know, bad people
might have house alarms,
											but it will also make all of us
											less secure as an end result.
											Backdooring encryption algorithms
											just boggles the mind.
											But of course, these intelligence agencies
are doing their job.
											This is what they have been told to do:
											do signals intelligence,
											monitor telecommunications,
											monitor Internet traffic.
											That&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to do,
											and since most, a very big part
of the Internet traffic today is encrypted,
											they&#39;re trying to find ways around the encryption.
											One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,
											which is a great example
											about how U.S. intelligence agencies
											are running loose.
											They are completely out of control,
											and they should be brought back under control.

									<p>
											So what do we actually know about the leaks?
											Everything is based on the files
											leaked by Mr. Snowden.
											The very first PRISM slides
											from the beginning of June
											detail a collection program where the data
											is collected from service providers,
											and they actually go and name the service providers
											they have access to.
											They even have a specific date
											on when the collection of data began
											for each of the service providers.
											So for example, they name
the collection from Microsoft
											started on September 11, 2007,
											for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,
											and then others: Google, Facebook,
											Skype, Apple and so on.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And every single one of these companies denies.
											They all say that this simply isn&#39;t true,
											that they are not giving
backdoor access to their data.
											Yet we have these files.
											So is one of the parties lying,
											or is there some other alternative explanation?
											And one explanation would be
											that these parties, these service providers,
											are not cooperating.
											Instead, they&#39;ve been hacked.
											That would explain it. They aren&#39;t cooperating. They&#39;ve been hacked.
											In this case, they&#39;ve been hacked
by their own government.
											That might sound outlandish,
											but we already have cases where this has happened,
											for example, the case of the Flame malware
											which we strongly believe was authored
											by the U.S. government,
											and which, to spread, subverted the security
											of the Windows Update network,
											meaning here, the company was hacked
											by their own government.
											And there&#39;s more evidence
											supporting this theory as well.
											Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information
											about the operations run by the elite hacker units
											operating inside these intelligence agencies.
											Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO,
											Tailored Access Operations,
											and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,
											it&#39;s called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.
											And these recent leaks of these three slides
											detail an operation
											run by this GCHQ intelligence agency
											from the United Kingdom
											targeting a telecom here in Belgium.
											And what this really means
											is that an E.U. country&#39;s intelligence agency
											is breaching the security
											of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,
											and they discuss it in their slides completely casually,
											business as usual.
											Here&#39;s the primary target,
											here&#39;s the secondary target,
											here&#39;s the teaming.
											They probably have a team building
on Thursday evening in a pub.
											They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art
											like, you know, &quot;Success,&quot;
											when they gain access to services like this.
											What the hell?

									<p>
											And then there&#39;s the argument
											that okay, yes, this might be going on,
											but then again, other countries are doing it as well.
											All countries spy.
											And maybe that&#39;s true.
											Many countries spy, not all of them,
but let&#39;s take an example.
											Let&#39;s take, for example, Sweden.
											I&#39;m speaking of Sweden because Sweden
											has a little bit of a similar law to the United States.
											When your data traffic goes through Sweden,
											their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law
											to intercept that traffic.
											All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers
											and politicians and business leaders
											use, every day, U.S.-based services,
											like, you know, run Windows or OSX,
											or use Facebook or LinkedIn,
											or store their data in clouds like iCloud
											or Skydrive or DropBox,
											or maybe use online services like
Amazon web services or sales support?
											And the answer is, every single Swedish
business leader does that every single day.
											And then we turn it around.
											How many American leaders
											use Swedish webmails and cloud services?
											And the answer is zero.
											So this is not balanced.
											It&#39;s not balanced by any means, not even close.

									<p>
											And when we do have the occasional
											European success story,
											even those, then, typically end up being sold
to the United States.
											Like, Skype used to be secure.
											It used to be end-to-end encrypted.
											Then it was sold to the United States.
											Today, it no longer is secure.
											So once again, we take something which is secure
											and then we make it less secure on purpose,
											making all of us less secure as an outcome.

											And then the argument that the United States
											is only fighting terrorists.
											It&#39;s the war on terror.
											You shouldn&#39;t worry about it.
											Well, it&#39;s not the war on terror.
											Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,
											there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,
											and we should fight them,
											but we know through these leaks
											that they have used the same techniques
											to listen to phone calls of European leaders,
											to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,
											to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,
											and I don&#39;t think they are trying to find terrorists
											from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?
											It&#39;s not the war on terror.
											Part of it might be, and there are terrorists,
											but are we really thinking about terrorists
											as such an existential threat
											that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?
											Are the Americans ready
to throw away the Constituion
											and throw it in the trash
just because there are terrorists?
											And the same thing with the Bill of Rights
and all the amendments
											and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
											and the E.U. conventions on human rights

											Because we have this thing called privacy,
											and if you really think that you have nothing to hide,
											please make sure that&#39;s the first thing you tell me,
											because then I know
											that I should not trust you with any secrets,
											because obviously you can&#39;t keep a secret.
											But people are brutally honest with the Internet,
											and when these leaks started,
											many people were asking me about this.
											And I have nothing to hide.
											I&#39;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal.
											Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular
											like to share with an intelligence agency,
											especially a foreign intelligence agency.
											And if we indeed need a Big Brother,
											I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother
											than a foreign Big Brother.
											And when the leaks started,
the very first thing I tweeted about this
											was a comment about how,
											when you&#39;ve been using search engines,
											you&#39;ve been potentially leaking all that
to U.S. intelligence.
											And two minutes later, I got a reply
											by somebody called Kimberly from the United States
											challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?
											What am I sending to worry about this?
Am I sending naked pictures or something?
											And my answer to Kimberly was
											that what I&#39;m sending is none of your business,
											and it should be none
of your government&#39;s business either.
											Because that&#39;s what it&#39;s about. It&#39;s about privacy.
											Privacy is nonnegotiable.
											It should be built in to all the systems we use.
