											(English) I was born
in a middle class family.
											My father was five years old
when he lost his father,
											but by the time I was born,
											he was already a businessman.
											But it didn&#39;t make a difference to him
											if his children were going to be
a boy or a girl:
											they were going to go to school.
											So I guess I was the lucky one.

											My mother had 16 pregnancies.
											From 16 pregnancies, five of us are alive.
											You can imagine as a child
what I went through.
											Day to day, I watched women
											being carried to a graveyard,
											or watched children going to a graveyard.
											At that time, when I
finished my high school,
											I really wanted to be a doctor.
											I wanted to be a doctor
to help women and children.
											So I completed my education,
											but I wanted to go to university.
											Unfortunately, in my country,
there wasn&#39;t a dormitory for girls,
											so I was accepted in medical school,
but I could not go there.
											So as a result, my father
sent me to America.

I was completing my education,
											I didn&#39;t know what was going on
with my family or with my country.
											There were months, years,
I didn&#39;t know about it.
											My family was in a refugee camp.

											But where was my heart?
											My heart was in Afghanistan.
											Day after day,
when I listened to the news,
											when I followed what was
going on with my country,
											my heart was breaking up.
											I really wanted to go back to my country,
											but at the same time I knew
I could not go there,
											because there was no place for me.
											I had a good job.
											I was a professor at a university.
											I earned good money.
											I had a good life.
											My family was here.
											I could live with them.
											But I wasn&#39;t happy.
											I wanted to go back home.
											So I went to the refugee camp.
											And when I went
to the refugee camp in Pakistan,
											there were 7.5 million refugees.
											7.5 million refugees.
											About 90 percent of them
were women and children.
											Most of the men have been killed
or they were in war.
											And you know, in the refugee camp,
											when I went day-to-day to do a survey,
											I found things you never could imagine.
											I saw a widow with five to eight children
											sitting there and weeping
											and not knowing what to do.
											I saw a young woman
have no way to go anywhere,
											no education, no entertainment,
no place to even live.
											I saw young men that had lost
their father and their home,
											and they are supporting the family
as a 10-to-12-year old boy —
											being the head of the household,
											trying to protect their sister
and their mother and their children.

									<p>
											So it was a very devastating situation.
											My heart was beating for my people,
											and I didn&#39;t know what to do.
											At that moment, we talk about momentum.
											At that moment, I felt,
what can I do for these people?
											How could I help these people?
											I am one individual.
What can I do for them?

									<p>
											But at that moment, I knew
											that education changed my life.
											It transformed me. It gave me status.
											It gave me confidence.
It gave me a career.
											It helped me to support my family,
											to bring my family to another country,
											to be safe.
											And I knew that at that moment
											that what I should give to my people
is education and health,
											and that&#39;s what I went after.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But do you think it was easy?
											No, because at that time, education
was banned for girls, completely.
											And also, by Russia invading Afghanistan,
											people were not trusting anyone.
											It was very hard to come and say,
&quot;I want to do this.&quot;
											Who am I?
											Somebody who comes from the United States.
											Somebody who got educated here.
											Did they trust me? Of course not.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I really needed to build
the trust in this community.
											How am I going to do that?
											I went and surveyed and looked and looked.
											I asked.
											Finally, I found one man.
											He was 80 years old.
											He was a mullah.
											I went to his tent in the camp,
											and I asked him,
											&quot;I want to make you a teacher.&quot;
											And he looked at me,
											and he said, &quot;Crazy woman,
											crazy woman, how do you think
I can be a teacher?&quot;
											And I told him,
&quot;I will make you a teacher.&quot;
											Finally, he accepted my offer,
											and once I started a class
in his compound,
											the word spread all over.
											In a matter of one year,
											we had 25 schools set up,
											15,000 children going to school,
											and it was amazing.

we were giving teacher training.

											And one day, I tell you,
											one day I was in the office
in Peshawar, Pakistan.
											All of a sudden, I saw my staff
running to rooms and locking the doors

											And, of course, by that time,
you know how I dress —

											And one day, with four trainers
and one bodyguard,

											I told her the whole story.
											At that time, she said, &quot;OK,

											You will help them.&quot;
											And when, two days later,
I went the same route,

											I said, &quot;On one condition,
that whatever I say, you accept it.&quot;
											And they said, yes, they do.
											So I took them to the mosque,
											and to make a long story short,
											I told them I&#39;d give them teachers.
											Today, they are the best trainers.
											They learn English,
											they learn how to be teachers,
											they learn computers,

											Every area that is unknown to us

											We were going everywhere.
											Women were getting education:
