											&quot;Even in purely non-religious terms,

											When I was perhaps six years old,
											I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother.
											And at the end of buying our shoes,
											the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home.
											My brother wanted a red balloon, and I wanted a pink balloon.
											My mother said that she thought I&#39;d really rather have a blue balloon.
											But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one.
											And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue.
											The fact that my favorite color now is blue, but I&#39;m still gay —

											When I was little, my mother used to say,
											&quot;The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world.
											And until you have children, you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like.&quot;
											And when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world
											that she would say that about parenting my brother and me.
											And when I was an adolescent, I thought
											that I&#39;m gay, and so I probably can&#39;t have a family.
											And when she said it, it made me anxious.
											And after I came out of the closet,
											when she continued to say it, it made me furious.
											I said, &quot;I&#39;m gay. That&#39;s not the direction that I&#39;m headed in.
											And I want you to stop saying that.&quot;

											About 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine
											to write a piece about deaf culture.
											And I was rather taken aback.
											I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.
											Those poor people, they couldn&#39;t hear.
											They lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?
											And then I went out into the deaf world.
											I went to deaf clubs.
											I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.
											I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee
											where people complained about that slurry Southern signing.

											The day after our son was born,
											the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned.
											He wasn&#39;t extending his legs appropriately.
											She said that might mean that he had brain damage.
											In so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,
											which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.
											And he had a very large head, which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus.

											And as she told me all of these things,
											I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.
											And I thought, here I had been working for years
											on a book about how much meaning people had found
											in the experience of parenting children who are disabled,
											and I didn&#39;t want to join their number.
											Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness.
											And like all parents since the dawn of time,
											I wanted to protect my child from illness.
											And I wanted also to protect myself from illness.
											And yet, I knew from the work I had done
											that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,
											that those would ultimately be his identity,
											and if they were his identity they would become my identity,
											that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded.

											We took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner,
											we took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.
											We felt helpless.
											And at the end of five hours,
											they said that his brain was completely clear
											and that he was by then extending his legs correctly.
											And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on,
											she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp.

											During these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned
											the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility,
											and I had come to see how it conquers everything else.
											And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools,
											enslaving themselves to a lifetime&#39;s journey with their thankless children

											I realized that day that my research had built me a plank
