<title>Ameenah Gurib-Fakim and Stephanie Busari: An interview with Mauritius&#39;s first female president | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Ameenah Gurib-Fakim has been an academic, an entrepreneur and is now the president of Mauritius -- the first Muslim female head of state in Africa. In a wide-ranging conversation with journalist Stephanie Busari, Gurib-Fakim discusses the humble beginnings of her political career, what it&#39;s like to be both a person of faith and a scientist and why we need to value traditional African knowledge, among much more. &quot;I don&#39;t think you should take yourself seriously,&quot; she says. &quot;You need to have trust in what you can do, have confidence in yourself and give yourself a set of goals and just work towards them.&quot;" />

<meta content="An interview with Mauritius's first female president" itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Ameenah Gurib-Fakim has been an academic, an entrepreneur and is now the president of Mauritius — the first Muslim female head of state in Africa. In a wide-ranging conversation with journalist Stephanie Busari, Gurib-Fakim discusses the humble beginnings of her political career, what it&#x0027;s like to be both a person of faith and a scientist and why we need to value traditional African knowledge, among much more. "I don&#x0027;t think you should take yourself seriously," she says. "You need to have trust in what you can do, have confidence in yourself and give yourself a set of goals and just work towards them."' itemprop='description'>

											AGF: OK, thanks, Stephanie.
											First of all, I&#39;d like to thank TED
											for having given me
the opportunity to be here today.
											And I would also like to thank
the government of Tanzania
											and the president for the welcome.
											And also, I&#39;d like to thank
the contribution of our consul,
											Mr. Rizvi, who&#39;s here,
											has been very supportive
for all our stay here.
											Now, to answer your question,
											did I have any ambitions in politics?
											The straight answer is no.
											I did not choose the world of politics;
											the world of politics chose me.
											So here I am.

											SB: So, was there ever
anything in your journey

									<p>
											AGF: Absolutely not.
											I think the journey started
immediately after TED, actually.
											When I went back,
this journalist called me and said,
											&quot;You know, your name has been cited
for the president of the republic,&quot;
											I said, &quot;Ma&#39;am, you must be mistaken,
											because I have no ambition whatsoever.&quot;
											She said, &quot;No, it&#39;s serious.
											Can you come and tell me this
in the form of a declaration?
											So, OK, you&#39;ll come?&quot;
											So, of course, as good journalists go,
											the next day I see my TED picture
											and, with my name, Ameenah Gurib-Fakim,
											&quot;For president?&quot;
											A very small interrogation mark —
											and people don&#39;t see
the interrogation mark,
											they just see my name
and they see my picture.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And that was a sounding board.
											And again, as you have just said,
											it was a very interesting scenario
											because it was a scenario
where they wanted to have somebody
											who was credible,
											had this political neutrality
											and at the same time, was for a minority
											because Islam is a minority
religion in Mauritius,
											because in Mauritius,
we stratify people&#39;s origins
											by virtue of their religious belief.
											And — I was a woman.
											So this made it all very interesting.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So there we go, and this
whole campaign started,
											and then people said, &quot;Why not?&quot;
											Now, this is very important
to note, Stephanie,
											because normally, the president
is elected after the election.
											And here we had a scenario
											where the name of the president
was flagged before the election process,
											during the campaign.
											So when people voted,
they knew that at some point,
											they would have
this Muslim woman president.

have been most productive.
											When we talk about the Arab Golden Age,

											This was a time
when cultures, religions —

											As a woman of faith and also a scientist,

seem to be at loggerheads.
											It wasn&#39;t always so,
											but I&#39;m interested to get your thoughts
on how you reconcile both

											AGF: They&#39;re not mutually exclusive.
											I mean, if you&#39;re a scientist,
											you tend to really look
at the perfection of the human body,
											the way it functions.
											If you look at nature as a whole.
											I&#39;m still amazed at the perfection
											with which the entire
ecosystem functions together.
											However, to the purists,
to those who are of faith,
											they will tell you, &quot;Yes,
there has been evolution.&quot;
											Even the Pope has agreed
that evolution exists.
											But there&#39;s always the question:
What came first?
											What came before this?
											When we talk about all
the various strata of evolution,
											we&#39;ll always be asking the question,
											there must be something before.
											So I&#39;m of the opinion that yes,
											there is this great spiritual force
which is guiding the process,
											and things like this
don&#39;t happen by chance.
											Now, whether you call it religiosity,
											whether you call
this great spirit by any name —
											Brahma, Allah, the Holy Trinity —
											you name it —
											but I still think that these two
are not mutually exclusive.
											They can still coexist with each other.

											SB: So let&#39;s move
to one of your passions — science.
											You&#39;ve made no secret of that.
											And you&#39;ve always been
passionate about science.
											I read that when you were
a very young girl,
											you went to a career guidance counselor
											and told them you wanted
to become a chemist,
											and they said, &quot;No, it&#39;s for boys.
											Boys do science.&quot;

											AGF: Well, to begin with,
											I must say, before I came
to that career guidance officer,
											I had great teachers who motivated.
											And this is something I would like
to draw attention to again,
											to our education system.
											We have to do away
with this rote learning.
											We have to ensure that we drive
this curiosity in the child,
											and they need to be curious.
											And if we want to move along the line
for them to become great scientists,
											they need to become more and more
curious in everything they do.

											So every time — exactly —
I went to see the careers guidance,
											he looked at me and said,
&quot;What do you want to do?&quot;
											I said, &quot;I want to study chemistry.&quot;
											&quot;Well, you shouldn&#39;t study chemistry
because this is for boys.
											And the next thing, when you come
back, there&#39;ll be no job for you.&quot;
											So I went back home,
											and I had a great cheerleader at home
who happens to be my father.
											He said, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot;
and asked, &quot;What did he say?&quot;
											I said, &quot;This is what he said ...&quot;
He said, &quot;What are you going to do?&quot;
											I said, &quot;I&#39;m going to do chemistry.&quot;
											So there I was.
											And one thing I will say:
one must always follow your heart.
											And my heart was always in chemistry.
											I did what I was passionate about,
											and I thought at some point
that I had developed this thinking
											that if you&#39;re passionate
about what you do,
											you will not have to work
a single day in your life,

Confucius who said that.

											Yesterday, I was listening
to one of the talks;
											it was the talk about the need for Africa
to turn into a knowledge economy.
											Africa has got very rich traditions.
											Sub-Saharan Africa, southern Africa,
											has got over 5,000
medicinal plant species,
											not harnessed.
											And, in fact, at the TED talk
I gave in 2014,
											I came out with one sentence:
											&quot;Biodiversity underpins life on earth.&quot;
											And if we don&#39;t look after
this biodiversity,
											if we don&#39;t protect it,
											if we don&#39;t actually
harness it in the right way,
											we are threatening
our own livelihoods on this planet.
											When we talk about the contribution
from countries of the north
											to the Green Fund
for the protection of our planet,
											it is not charity.
											It is to ensure our own collective
livelihoods on this planet.
											So this is something
that must be addressed.

											Now, again, when you talk about
											getting this biodiversity
of Africa working for us,
											you&#39;d be shocked to know
											that out of the 1,100 blockbuster drugs
that we have on the market,
											only 83 come from African plants.
											Why is this so?
											Because we are responsible;
											us Africans.
											We don&#39;t value
our own traditional knowledge.
											We don&#39;t give it the same status
as allopathic medicine.
											Look at what China has done.
											China has given the same status
for traditional Chinese medicine
											as allopathic medicine,
											as of 2016.
											Our governments, our people,
have not documented,
											have not taken this knowledge seriously.
											If you want to get serious about Africa
becoming a knowledge continent,
											this is something that we need
to address very seriously,
											we need to start documenting,
											we need to start codifying this knowledge,
											and unfortunately,
we are racing against time
											because tradition in Africa is that
the transmission has always been oral.

was I documented precisely these plants.
											And I&#39;ll tell you one thing —
it was not perceived to be very serious,
											because here I was,
in synthetic organic chemistry,
											going out there,
talking to these grandmothers,
											documenting their recipes.
											I mean, you can&#39;t be serious —
bringing weeds in the lab,
											and say, &quot;We&#39;re going
to be working on these.&quot;
											Are we going to get results?
											So it was really a race against prejudice
											to try to take people&#39;s —
											bring them to the table and say,
&quot;Look, this is very important.&quot;
											But I&#39;m glad I did,
											because by that time, you start
developing a crocodile skin,
											especially when you&#39;re a woman in the lab
doing different things.
											You know — you become suspect.
											So I documented it; I&#39;m very happy I did.
											And now, almost 20 years
since the documentation,
											it now constitutes prior art,

started working on as well.

											of leadership and governance.
											It&#39;s hard to ignore
that there&#39;s corruption on this continent
											with some of our leaders.
											How have you confronted that in your role,
											and what experiences can you
share with us around this issue?

											AGF: We&#39;ve had corruption —
											corruption doesn&#39;t exist only in Africa.
											Where there is a corruptee,
there is a corrupter.
											Right? It&#39;s always a two-way process.
											We have focused in my country,
											we are working very hard towards
doing something about corruption,
											but, you know, they also have
great people in Africa.
											Why do we always focus on the negative?
Why don&#39;t we talk about ...
											I want to bring on board, for example,
the great quotes of Nelson Mandela.
											His legacy is still very much alive.
											We have people in — even in Tanzania,
we&#39;ve had Julius Nyerere,
											he have Nkrumah,
											we have Kenyatta,
											we have all these people
who have been champions of Africa.
											I think we need to take
pages of their book and see.
											In fact, Julius Nyerere himself
had been a great advocate for science
											when he said that &quot;science
will make deserts bloom.&quot;
											So these are some of the founding
fathers of this continent;
											we need to take pages from them
											and move ahead.
