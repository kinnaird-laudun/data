<title>Joe Lassiter: We need nuclear power to solve climate change | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Joe Lassiter is a deep thinker and straight talker focused on developing clean, secure and carbon-neutral supplies of reliable, low-cost energy. His analysis of the world&#39;s energy realities puts a powerful lens on the stubbornly touchy issue of nuclear power, including new designs for plants that can compete economically with fossil fuels. We have the potential to make nuclear safer and cheaper than it&#39;s been in the past, Lassiter says. Now we have to make the choice to pursue it." />

<meta content="Joe Lassiter is a deep thinker and straight talker focused on developing clean, secure and carbon-neutral supplies of reliable, low-cost energy. His analysis of the world's energy realities puts a powerful lens on the stubbornly touchy issue of nuclear power, including new designs for plants that can compete economically with fossil fuels. We have the potential to make nuclear safer and cheaper than it's been in the past, Lassiter says. Now we have to make the choice to pursue it." itemprop='description'>

											It&#39;s easy to forget that last night,
											one billion people went to sleep
without access to electricity.
											One billion people.
											Two and a half billion people
did not have access to clean cooking fuels
											or clean heating fuels.
											Those are the problems
in the developing world.
											And it&#39;s easy for us not to be empathetic
											with those people
who seem so distanced from us.

									<p>
											But even in our own world,
the developed world,
											we see the tension of stagnant economies
											impacting the lives of people around us.
											We see it in whole pieces of the economy,
											where the people involved
have lost hope about the future
											and despair about the present.
											We see that in the Brexit vote.
											We see that in the Sanders/Trump
campaigns in my own country.
											But even in countries as recently
turning the corner
											towards being in the developed world,
											in China,
											we see the difficulty
that President Xi has
											as he begins to un-employ so many people
in his coal and mining industries
											who see no future for themselves.
											As we as a society
figure out how to manage
											the problems of the developed world
											and the problems of the developing world,
											we have to look at how we move forward
											and manage the environmental impact
of those decisions.

											We&#39;ve been working on this problem
for 25 years, since Rio,
											the Kyoto Protocols.
											Our most recent move is the Paris treaty,
											and the resulting climate agreements
											that are being ratified
by nations around the world.
											I think we can be very hopeful
											that those agreements,
which are bottom-up agreements,
											where nations have said
what they think they can do,
											are genuine and forthcoming
for the vast majority of the parties.
											The unfortunate thing
											is that now, as we look
at the independent analyses
											of what those climate treaties
are liable to yield,
											the magnitude of the problem
before us becomes clear.

											This is the United States
Energy Information Agency&#39;s assessment
											of what will happen if the countries
implement the climate commitments
											that they&#39;ve made in Paris
											between now and 2040.
											It shows basically CO2 emissions
around the world
											over the next 30 years.
											There are three things that you need
to look at and appreciate.

											One, CO2 emissions are expected
to continue to grow
											for the next 30 years.
											In order to control climate,
											CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero
											because it&#39;s the cumulative emissions
that drive heating on the planet.
											This should tell you that we are losing
the race to fossil fuels.

									<p>
											The second thing you should notice
											is that the bulk of the growth
comes from the developing countries,
											from China, from India,
from the rest of the world,
											which includes South Africa
and Indonesia and Brazil,
											as most of these countries
move their people
											into the lower range of lifestyles
											that we literally take for granted
in the developed world.

									<p>
											The final thing that you should notice
											is that each year,
											about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting
added to the planet&#39;s atmosphere,
											and then diffusing into the ocean
and into the land.
											That&#39;s on top of the 550 gigatons
that are in place today.
											At the end of 30 years,
											we will have put 850 gigatons
of carbon into the air,
											and that probably goes a long way
											towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase
in global mean surface temperatures,
											locking in ocean acidification
											and locking in sea level rise.

											The overwhelming thing
that we need to appreciate
											is the choice that China has made.
											China has made the choice,

											The United States has an alternative.
											It can run on natural gas

of fracking and shale gas,

show interest in nuclear power.

											If we look at China&#39;s path,
											all of us know that prosperity in China
has dramatically increased.
											In 1980, 80 percent of China&#39;s population
											lived below the extreme poverty level,
											below the level of having
$1.90 per person per day.
											By the year 2000, only 20 percent
of China&#39;s population

											a remarkable feat,
											admittedly, with some costs
in civil liberties
											that would be tough to accept
in the Western world.
											But the impact of all that wealth
											allowed people to get
massively better nutrition.
											It allowed water pipes to be placed.
											It allowed sewage pipes to be placed,
											dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases,
											at the cost of some outdoor air pollution.

											India will supply nearly four times

											First of all, we have to think
about the magnitude of the problem.
											Between now and 2040,
											800 to 1,600 new coal plants
are going to be built around the world.
											This week, between one and three
one-gigawatt coal plants
											are being turned on around the world.

of what we want,
											because the people
that rule their countries,
											assessing the interests of their citizens,
											have decided it&#39;s in the interest
of their citizens to do that.
											And that&#39;s going to happen
unless they have a better alternative.

											What we&#39;ve forgotten is something
that Vinod Khosla used to talk about,
											a man of Indian ethnicity
but an American venture capitalist.
											And he said, back in the early 2000s,
											that if you needed to get
China and India off of fossil fuels,
											you had to create a technology
that passed the &quot;Chindia test,&quot;
											&quot;Chindia&quot; being the appending
of the two words.
											It had to be first of all viable,
											meaning that technically, they could
implement it in their country,

											Two, it had to be a technology
that was scalable,

again, that we take for granted.

											without subsidy or without mandate.

											it could not be maintained
for that many people

had to go begging

											If you look at the Chindia test,
											we simply have not come up
with alternatives that meet that test.
											That&#39;s what the EIA forecast tells us.
											China&#39;s building 800 gigawatts of coal,
											400 gigawatts of hydro,
											about 200 gigawatts of nuclear,
											and on an energy-equivalent basis,
adjusting for intermittency,

better than any other country,
											knowing the need better
than any other country.

											If you look at all the alternatives
that are out there,
											there are really two
that come near to meeting it.
											First is this area of new nuclear
that I&#39;ll talk about in just a second.
											It&#39;s a new generation of nuclear plants
that are on the drawing boards
											around the world,
											and the people who are
developing these say
											we can get them
in position to demo by 2025
											and to scale by 2030,
if you will just let us.
											The second alternative
that could be there in time
											is utility-scale solar
backed up with natural gas,
											which we can use today,
											versus the batteries
which are still under development.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what&#39;s holding new nuclear back?
											Outdated regulations
and yesterday&#39;s mindsets.
											We have not used our latest
scientific thinking on radiological health
											to think how we communicate
with the public
											and govern the testing
of new nuclear reactors.
											We have new scientific knowledge
that we need to use
											in order to improve the way
we regulate nuclear industry.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The second thing is we&#39;ve got a mindset
											that it takes 25 years
and 2 to 5 billion dollars
											to develop a nuclear power plant.
											That comes from the historical,
military mindset
											of the places nuclear power came from.
											These new nuclear ventures are saying
											that they can deliver power
for 5 cents a kilowatt hour;
											they can deliver it
for 100 gigawatts a year;
											they can demo it by 2025;
											and they can deliver it in scale by 2030,
											if only we give them a chance.

									<p>
											Right now, we&#39;re basically
waiting for a miracle.
											What we need is a choice.
											If they can&#39;t make it safe,
if they can&#39;t make it cheap,
											it should not be deployed.
											But what I want you to do
is not carry an idea forward,
											but write your leaders,
											write the head of the NGOs you support,
											and tell them to give you the choice,
											not the past.
