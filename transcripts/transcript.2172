Accompanied by Joshua Roman on cello and McKenzie Stubbert on piano, Milk traces his relationship to music and art -- from the first moment he remembers putting on headphones to his current work creating breakthrough virtual reality projects.

<meta content="Chris Milk uses innovative technologies to make personal, interactive, human stories. Accompanied by Joshua Roman on cello and McKenzie Stubbert on piano, Milk traces his relationship to music and art — from the first moment he remembers putting on headphones to his current work creating breakthrough virtual reality projects. VR is the last medium for storytelling, he says, because it closes the gap between audience and storyteller. To illustrate, he brought the TED audience together in the world's largest collective VR experience. Join them and take part in this interactive talk by getting a Google Cardboard and downloading the experience at with.in/TED." itemprop='description'>

at the right time fuses with us

for the same thing, though,
											to capture that lightning in a bottle.
											Except, I&#39;m not.
											Adding moving pictures over the music
added narrative dimension, yes,
											but never quite equated the power
											that just raw music had for me on its own.
											This is not a great thing to realize
when you&#39;ve devoted your life
											and professional career
to becoming a music video director.
											I kept asking myself,
did I take the wrong path?
											So I started thinking: if I could
involve you, the audience, more,
											I might be able to make you
feel something more as well.

											So Aaron Koblin and I began
auditioning new technologies
											that could put more of you
inside of the work,
											like your childhood home
in &quot;The Wilderness Downtown,&quot;
											your hand-drawn portraits,
in &quot;The Johnny Cash Project,&quot;
											and your interactive dreams
											in &quot;3 Dreams of Black.&quot;
											We were pushing beyond the screen,
											trying to connect more deeply
											to people&#39;s hearts and imaginations.
											But it wasn&#39;t quite enough.
											It still didn&#39;t have the raw
experiential power of pure music for me.

									<p>
											So I started chasing a new technology
											that I only had read about
in science fiction.
											And after years of searching,
I found a prototype.
											It was a project from Nonny de la Peña
in Mark Bolas&#39;s lab in USC.
											And when I tried it, I knew I&#39;d found it.
											I could taste the lightning.
											It was called virtual reality.
											This was it five years ago
when I ran into it.
											This is what it looks like now.

											I quickly started building things
in this new medium,
											and through that process
we realized something:
											that VR is going to play
an incredibly important role
											in the history of mediums.
											In fact, it&#39;s going to be the last one.
											I mean this because it&#39;s the first medium
that actually makes the jump
											from our internalization
of an author&#39;s expression
											of an experience,
											to our experiencing it firsthand.
											You look confused.
I&#39;ll explain. Don&#39;t worry.

											If we go back to the origins of mediums,
											by all best guesses,
											it starts around a fire,
with a good story.
											Our clan leader is telling us
											about how he hunted the woolly mammoth
on the tundra that day.
											We hear his words
											and translate them
into our own internal truths.
											The same thing happens
											when we look at the cave painting
version of the story,
											the book about the mammoth hunt,
											the play,
											the radio broadcast,
											the television show
											or the movie.
											All of these mediums require
what we call &quot;suspension of disbelief,&quot;
											because there&#39;s a translation gap
between the reality of the story
											and our consciousness
interpreting the story
											into our reality.
											I&#39;m using the word &quot;consciousness&quot;
as a feeling of reality that we get
											from our senses experiencing
the world around us.

											So here&#39;s what special about VR.
											In all other mediums,
											your consciousness interprets the medium.
											In VR, your consciousness is the medium.
											So the potential for VR is enormous.
											But where are we now?
											What is the current state of the art?
											Well,
											we are here.
											We are the equivalent
of year one of cinema.
											This is the Lumière Brothers film
											that allegedly sent a theater full
of people running for their lives
											as they thought a train
was coming toward them.
											Similar to this early stage
of this medium,
											in VR, we also have to move
past the spectacle
											and into the storytelling.
											It took this medium decades
											to figure out its preferred
language of storytelling,
											in the form of a feature film.
											In VR today, we&#39;re more learning grammar
											than writing language.

											We&#39;ve made 15 films in the last year
at our VR company, Vrse,

											We found that we have a unique,

											your emotions, even your body.

											So, first: camera movement
is tricky in VR.
											Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.
											We found if you move the camera
at a constant speed in a straight line,
											you can actually get away with it, though.
											The first day in film school,
											they told me you have to learn
every single rule
											before you can break one.
											We have not learned every single rule.
											We&#39;ve barely learned any at all,
											but we&#39;re already trying to break them
											to see what kind of creative things
we can accomplish.
											In this shot here, where we&#39;re moving up
off the ground, I added acceleration.
											I did that because I wanted
to give you a physical sensation
											of moving up off the ground.
											In VR, I can give that to you.

											Contrary to popular belief,
											there is composition in virtual reality,
											but it&#39;s completely
different than in film,
											where you have a rectangular frame.
											Composition is now
where your consciousness exists
											and how the world moves around you.
											In this film, &quot;Waves of Grace,&quot;
which was a collaboration between Vrse,
											the United Nations, Gabo Arora,
and Imraan Ismail,
											we also see the changing role
of the close-up in virtual reality.
											A close-up in VR means
you&#39;re actually close up to someone.
											It brings that character inside
of your personal space,
											a space that we&#39;d usually reserve
for the people that we love.
											And you feel an emotional
closeness to the character
											because of what you feel
to be a physical closeness.

											Directing VR is not like
directing for the rectangle.
											It&#39;s more of a choreography
of the viewer&#39;s attention.
											One tool we can use
to guide your attention
											is called &quot;spatialized sound.&quot;
											I can put a sound anywhere
in front of you, to left or right,
											even behind you,
											and when you turn your head,
the sound will rotate accordingly.
											So I can use that to direct your attention
to where I want you to see.

											VR makes us feel
like we are part of something.
											For most of human history,
we lived in small family units.
											We started in caves,
											then moved to clans and tribes,
then villages and towns,
											and now we&#39;re all global citizens.
											But I believe that we are still
hardwired to care the most
											about the things that are local to us.
											And VR makes anywhere
and anyone feel local.
											That&#39;s why it works as an empathy machine.
											Our film &quot;Clouds Over Sidra&quot;
takes you to a Syrian refugee camp,
											and instead of watching a story
about people over there,
											it&#39;s now a story about us here.

											But where do we go from here?
											The tricky thing is that
with all previous mediums,
											the format is fixed at its birth.
											Film has been a sequence of rectangles,
											from Muybridge and his horses to now.
											The format has never changed.
											But VR as a format, as a medium,
											isn&#39;t complete yet.
											It&#39;s not using physical celluloid
or paper or TV signals.
											It actually employs what we use
to make sense of the world.
											We&#39;re using your senses
as the paints on the canvas,
											but only two right now.
											Eventually, we can see if we will have
all of our human senses employed,
											and we will have agency to live
the story in any path we choose.
											And we call it virtual reality right now,
											but what happens when we move
past simulated realities?
											What do we call it then?
											What if instead of verbally
telling you about a dream,
											I could let you live inside that dream?
											What if instead of just experiencing
visiting some reality on Earth,
											you could surf gravitational waves
on the edge of a black hole,
											or create galaxies from scratch,
											or communicate with each other
not using words
											but using our raw thoughts?
											That&#39;s not a virtual reality anymore.
											And honestly I don&#39;t know
what that&#39;s called.
											But I hope you see where we&#39;re going.

a little bit of that lightning
											by sticking our head in one again.
