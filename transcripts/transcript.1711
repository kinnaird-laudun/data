<title>Anne Curzan: What makes a word &quot;real&quot;? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>

After all, who actually decides which words make it into those pages? Language historian Anne Curzan gives a charming look at the humans behind dictionaries, and the choices they make." />

											When people meet me at parties
											and they find out that I&#39;m an English professor
											who specializes in language,
											they generally have one of two reactions.
											One set of people look frightened. (Laughter)
											They often say something like,
											&quot;Oh, I&#39;d better be careful what I say.
											I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll hear every mistake I make.&quot;
											And then they stop talking. (Laughter)
											And they wait for me to go away
											and talk to someone else.
											The other set of people,
											their eyes light up,
											and they say,
											&quot;You are just the person I want to talk to.&quot;
											And then they tell me about whatever it is
											they think is going wrong with the English language.

											A couple of weeks ago, I was at a dinner party
											and the man to my right
											started telling me about all the ways
											that the Internet is degrading the English language.
											He brought up Facebook, and he said,
											&quot;To defriend? I mean, is that even a real word?&quot;

									<p>
											I want to pause on that question:
											What makes a word real?
											My dinner companion and I both know
											what the verb &quot;defriend&quot; means,
											so when does a new word like &quot;defriend&quot;
											become real?
											Who has the authority to make those kinds
											of official decisions about words, anyway?
											Those are the questions I want to talk about today.

									<p>
											I think most people, when they say a word isn&#39;t real,
											what they mean is, it doesn&#39;t appear
											in a standard dictionary.
											That, of course, raises a host of other questions,
											including, who writes dictionaries?

									<p>
											Before I go any further,
											let me clarify my role in all of this.
											I do not write dictionaries.
											I do, however, collect new words
											much the way dictionary editors do,
											and the great thing about being a historian
											of the English language
											is that I get to call this &quot;research.&quot;
											When I teach the history of the English language,
											I require that students teach me
											two new slang words before I will begin class.
											Over the years, I have learned
											some great new slang this way,
											including &quot;hangry,&quot; which —
											(Applause) —
											which is when you are cranky or angry
											because you are hungry,
											and &quot;adorkable,&quot;
											which is when you are adorable
											in kind of a dorky way,
											clearly, terrific words that fill
											important gaps in the English language.
											(Laughter)
											But how real are they
											if we use them primarily as slang
											and they don&#39;t yet appear in a dictionary?
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

											With that, let&#39;s turn to dictionaries.
											I&#39;m going to do this as a show of hands:
											How many of you still regularly
											refer to a dictionary, either print or online?
											Okay, so that looks like most of you.
											Now, a second question. Again, a show of hands:
											How many of you have ever looked to see
											who edited the dictionary you are using?
											Okay, many fewer.
											At some level, we know that there are human hands
											behind dictionaries,
											but we&#39;re really not sure who those hands belong to.
											I&#39;m actually fascinated by this.
											Even the most critical people out there
											tend not to be very critical about dictionaries,
											not distinguishing among them
											and not asking a whole lot of questions
											about who edited them.
											Just think about the phrase
											&quot;Look it up in the dictionary,&quot;
											which suggests that all dictionaries
											are exactly the same.
											Consider the library here on campus,

											Now, don&#39;t get me wrong,
											dictionaries are fantastic resources,
											but they are human
											and they are not timeless.
											I&#39;m struck as a teacher
											that we tell students to critically question
											every text they read, every website they visit,
											except dictionaries,
											which we tend to treat as un-authored,
											as if they came from nowhere to give us answers
											about what words really mean.
											Here&#39;s the thing: If you ask dictionary editors,
											what they&#39;ll tell you
											is they&#39;re just trying to keep up with us
											as we change the language.
											They&#39;re watching what we say and what we write
											and trying to figure out what&#39;s going to stick
											and what&#39;s not going to stick.
											They have to gamble,
											because they want to appear cutting edge
											and catch the words that are going to make it,
											such as LOL,
											but they don&#39;t want to appear faddish
											and include the words that aren&#39;t going to make it,
											and I think a word that they&#39;re watching right now
											is YOLO, you only live once.

											Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors,
											and you might be surprised
											by one of the places where we hang out.
											Every January, we go
											to the American Dialect Society annual meeting,
											where among other things,
											we vote on the word of the year.
											There are about 200 or 300 people who come,
											some of the best known
linguists in the United States.
											To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting,
											it occurs right before happy hour.
											Anyone who comes can vote.
											The most important rule is
											that you can vote with only one hand.
											In the past, some of the winners have been
											&quot;tweet&quot; in 2009
											and &quot;hashtag&quot; in 2012.
											&quot;Chad&quot; was the word of the year in the year 2000,
											because who knew what a chad was before 2000,
											and &quot;WMD&quot; in 2002.

											Now, we have other categories in which we vote too,
											and my favorite category
											is most creative word of the year.
											Past winners in this category have included
											&quot;recombobulation area,&quot;
											which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security,
											where you can recombobulate.
											(Laughter)
											You can put your belt back on,
											put your computer back in your bag.
											And then my all-time favorite word at this vote,
											which is &quot;multi-slacking.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And multi-slacking is the act
											of having multiple windows up on your screen
											so it looks like you&#39;re working

											Will all of these words stick? Absolutely not.
											And we have made some questionable choices,
											for example in 2006
											when the word of the year was &quot;Plutoed,&quot;
											to mean demoted.
											(Laughter)
											But some of the past winners
											now seem completely unremarkable,

											and &quot;e&quot; as a prefix,

											Now, a few weeks before our vote,
											Lake Superior State University
											issues its list of banished words for the year.
											What is striking about this
											is that there&#39;s actually often quite a lot of overlap
											between their list and the list that we are considering
											for words of the year,
											and this is because we&#39;re noticing the same thing.
											We&#39;re noticing words that are coming into prominence.
											It&#39;s really a question of attitude.
											Are you bothered by language
fads and language change,
											or do you find it fun, interesting,
											something worthy of study
											as part of a living language?

											The list by Lake Superior State University
											continues a fairly long tradition in English
											of complaints about new words.
											So here is Dean Henry Alford in 1875,
											who was very concerned that &quot;desirability&quot;
											is really a terrible word.
											In 1760, Benjamin Franklin
											wrote a letter to David Hume
											giving up the word &quot;colonize&quot; as bad.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Over the years, we&#39;ve also seen worries
											about new pronunciations.
											Here is Samuel Rogers in 1855
											who is concerned about some
fashionable pronunciations
											that he finds offensive,
											and he says &quot;as if contemplate were not bad enough,
											balcony makes me sick.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											The word is borrowed in from Italian
											and it was pronounced bal-COE-nee.

									<p>
											These complaints now strike us as quaint,
											if not downright adorkable — (Laughter) —
											but here&#39;s the thing:
											we still get quite worked up about language change.
											I have an entire file in my office
											of newspaper articles
											which express concern about illegitimate words
											that should not have been included in the dictionary,
											including &quot;LOL&quot;
											when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary
											and &quot;defriend&quot;
											when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary.
											I also have articles expressing concern
											about &quot;invite&quot; as a noun,
											&quot;impact&quot; as a verb,
											because only teeth can be impacted,
											and &quot;incentivize&quot; is described
											as &quot;boorish, bureaucratic misspeak.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, it&#39;s not that dictionary editors
											ignore these kinds of attitudes about language.
											They try to provide us some guidance about words
											that are considered slang or informal
											or offensive, often through usage labels,
											but they&#39;re in something of a bind,
											because they&#39;re trying to describe what we do,
											and they know that we often go to dictionaries
											to get information about how we should use a word
											well or appropriately.
											In response, the American Heritage Dictionaries
											include usage notes.
											Usage notes tend to occur with words
											that are troublesome in one way,
											and one of the ways that they can be troublesome
											is that they&#39;re changing meaning.
											Now usage notes involve very human decisions,
											and I think, as dictionary users,
											we&#39;re often not as aware of those human decisions
											as we should be.
											To show you what I mean,
											we&#39;ll look at an example, but before we do,
											I want to explain what the dictionary editors
											are trying to deal with in this usage note.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Think about the word &quot;peruse&quot;
											and how you use that word.
											I would guess many of you are thinking
											of skim, scan, reading quickly.
											Some of you may even have some walking involved,
											because you&#39;re perusing grocery store shelves,
											or something like that.
											You might be surprised to learn
											that if you look in most standard dictionaries,
											the first definition will be to read carefully,
											or pore over.
											American Heritage has that as the first definition.
											They then have, as the second definition, skim,
											and next to that, they say &quot;usage problem.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And then they include a usage note,
											which is worth looking at.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So here&#39;s the usage note:
											&quot;Peruse has long meant &#39;to read thoroughly&#39;...
											But the word is often used more loosely,
											to mean simply &#39;to read.&#39;...
											Further extension of the word
to mean &#39;to glance over, skim,&#39;
											has traditionally been considered an error,
											but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming
											somewhat more acceptable.
											When asked about the sentence,
											&#39;I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly,&#39;
											66 percent of the [Usage] Panel
											found it unacceptable in 1988,
											58 percent in 1999,
											and 48 percent in 2011.&quot;

									<p>
											Ah, the Usage Panel,
											that trusted body of language authorities
											who is getting more lenient about this.
											Now, what I hope you&#39;re thinking right now is,
											&quot;Wait, who&#39;s on the Usage Panel?
											And what should I do with their pronouncements?&quot;
											If you look in the front matter
											of American Heritage Dictionaries,
											you can actually find the names
											of the people on the Usage Panel.
											But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries?
											There are about 200 people on the Usage Panel.
											They include academicians,
											journalists, creative writers.
											There&#39;s a Supreme Court justice on it
											and a few linguists.
											As of 2005, the list includes me.

											Here&#39;s what we can do for you.
											We can give you a sense
											of the range of opinions about contested usage.
											That is and should be the extent of our authority.
											We are not a language academy.
											About once a year, I get a ballot
											that asks me about whether new uses,
											new pronunciations, new meanings, are acceptable.

											Now here&#39;s what I do to fill out the ballot.
											I listen to what other people are saying and writing.
											I do not listen to my own likes
											and dislikes about the English language.
											I will be honest with you:
											I do not like the word &quot;impactful,&quot;
											but that is neither here nor there
											in terms of whether &quot;impactful&quot;
is becoming common usage
											and becoming more acceptable in written prose.
											So to be responsible,
											what I do is go look at usage,
											which often involves going to look
											at online databases such as Google Books.
											Well, if you look for &quot;impactful&quot; in Google Books,
											here is what you find.
											Well, it sure looks like &quot;impactful&quot;
											is proving useful
											for a certain number of writers,
											and has become more and more useful
											over the last 20 years.

											Now, there are going to be changes
											that all of us don&#39;t like in the language.
											There are going to be changes where you think,
											&quot;Really?
											Does the language have to change that way?&quot;
											What I&#39;m saying is,
											we should be less quick
											to decide that that change is terrible,
											we should be less quick to impose
											our likes and dislikes about words on other people,
											and we should be entirely reluctant
											to think that the English language is in trouble.
											It&#39;s not. It is rich and vibrant and filled
											with the creativity of the speakers who speak it.
											In retrospect, we think it&#39;s fascinating
											that the word &quot;nice&quot; used to mean silly,
											and that the word &quot;decimate&quot;
											used to mean to kill one in every 10.
											(Laughter)
											We think that Ben Franklin was being silly
											to worry about &quot;notice&quot; as a verb.
											Well, you know what?
											We&#39;re going to look pretty silly in a hundred years
											for worrying about &quot;impact&quot; as a verb
											and &quot;invite&quot; as a noun.
											The language is not going to change so fast
											that we can&#39;t keep up.
											Language just doesn&#39;t work that way.
											I hope that what you can do
											is find language change not worrisome
											but fun and fascinating,
											just the way dictionary editors do.
											I hope you can enjoy being part
											of the creativity that is continually remaking
											our language and keeping it robust.

											So how does a word get into a dictionary?
											It gets in because we use it
											and we keep using it,
											and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.
											If you&#39;re thinking, &quot;But that lets all of us decide
											what words mean,&quot;
											I would say, &quot;Yes it does,
											and it always has.&quot;
											Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource,
											but there is no objective
dictionary authority out there
											that is the final arbiter about what words mean.
											If a community of speakers is using a word
											and knows what it means, it&#39;s real.
											That word might be slangy,
											that word might be informal,
											that word might be a word that you think
											is illogical or unnecessary,
											but that word that we&#39;re using,
											that word is real.
