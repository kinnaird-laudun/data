											I was trying to think, how is sync connected to happiness,
											and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing.
											We like to dance together, we like singing together.
											And so, if you&#39;ll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help
											with a first experiment today. The experiment is —
											and I notice, by the way, that when you applauded,
											that you did it in a typical North American way,
											that is, you were raucous and incoherent.
											You were not organized. It didn&#39;t even occur to you to clap in unison.
											Do you think you could do it? I would like to see if this audience would —
											no, you haven&#39;t practiced, as far as I know —
											can you get it together to clap in sync?

											So what do we make of that? First of all, we know that you&#39;re all brilliant.
											This is a room full of intelligent people, highly sensitive.
											Some trained musicians out there.
											Is that what enabled you to synchronize?
											So to put the question a little more seriously,
											let&#39;s ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did,
											for spontaneous synchronization.
											Do you need, for instance, to be as smart as you are?
											Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize?
											Do you need to be alive? I mean, that&#39;s a spooky thought, right?
											Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.
											It&#39;s real. In fact, I&#39;ll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of,
											if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.
											It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.
											It&#39;s a deep tendency toward order in nature
											that opposes what we&#39;ve all been taught about entropy.
											I mean, I&#39;m not saying the law of entropy is wrong — it&#39;s not.
											But there is a countervailing force in the universe —
											the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that&#39;s our theme.

									<p>
											Now, to get into that, let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately
											when you hear that we&#39;re talking about synchrony in nature,
											which is the glorious example of birds that flock together,
											or fish swimming in organized schools.
											So these are not particularly intelligent creatures,
											and yet, as we&#39;ll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets.
											This is from a BBC show called &quot;Predators,&quot;
											and what we&#39;re looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.
											When you&#39;re small and vulnerable, like these starlings,
											or like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.
											Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.
											For a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior,
											wondering how it could be possible.
											We&#39;re so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.
											These creatures are not choreographed.
											They&#39;re choreographing themselves.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And only today is science starting to figure out how it works.
											I&#39;ll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin, a researcher at Oxford,
											that shows how swarms work.
											There are just three simple rules.
											First, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.
											Second, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.
											And third, they&#39;re all attracted to each other,
											but they try to keep a small distance apart.
											And when you build those three rules in,
											automatically you start to see swarms
											that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks.
											Now, fish like to stay close together, about a body length apart.
											Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart.
											But except for that difference, the rules are the same for both.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, all this changes when a predator enters the scene.
											There&#39;s a fourth rule: when a predator&#39;s coming, get out of the way.
											Here on the model you see the predator attacking.
											The prey move out in random directions,
											and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again,
											so there&#39;s this constant splitting and reforming.
											And you see that in nature.
											Keep in mind that, although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate,
											what&#39;s really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior.
											Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers.
											That is, out of the desire to save itself,
											each creature is following these rules,
											and that leads to something that&#39;s safe for all of them.
											Even though it looks like they&#39;re thinking as a group, they&#39;re not.
											You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm,
											so you can think of several.

											As I say, if you&#39;re in a swarm, your odds of being the unlucky one
											are reduced as compared to a small group.
											There are many eyes to spot danger.
											And you&#39;ll see in the example with the starlings, with the birds,
											when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them,
											that actually waves of panic can propagate,
											sending messages over great distances.
											You&#39;ll see — let&#39;s see, it&#39;s coming up possibly at the very end — maybe not.
											Information can be sent over half a kilometer away
											in a very short time through this mechanism.
											Yes, it&#39;s happening here.
											See if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm.
											It&#39;s beautiful. The birds are, we sort of understand, we think,

											As I say, it&#39;s just those three simple rules,

											There is one case that we have begun to understand better,

											If you see fireflies in North America,
											like so many North American sorts of things,
											they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other.
											They each do their own thing, flashing on and off,
											paying no attention to their neighbors.
											But in Southeast Asia — places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo —
											there&#39;s a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies.
											You can see it every night along the river banks.
											The trees, mangrove trees, are filled with fireflies communicating with light.
											Specifically, it&#39;s male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together,
											in perfect synchrony, to reinforce a message to the females.
											And the message, as you can imagine, is &quot;Come hither. Mate with me.&quot;

											And then watch this whole river bank, and watch how precise the synchrony is.
											On, more on and then off.
											The combined light from these beetles — these are actually tiny beetles —
											is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them
											as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It&#39;s stunning.

											Okay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive
											to see this kind of spontaneous order,
											and I&#39;ve already hinted that the answer is no.
											Well, you don&#39;t have to be a whole creature.
											You can even be just a single cell.
											Like, take, for instance, your pacemaker cells in your heart right now.
											They&#39;re keeping you alive.
											Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region, the sinoatrial node,
											which has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep,
											have an electrical rhythm — a voltage up and down —
											to send a signal to the ventricles to pump.
											Now, your pacemaker is not a single cell.
											It&#39;s this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison
											for the pacemaker to work correctly.

											I don&#39;t want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea.
											If you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions,

											So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing.
											You don&#39;t have to be alive. You don&#39;t have to be even a single cell.
											If you look, for instance, at how lasers work,
											that would be a case of atomic synchrony.
											In a laser, what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here
											is that this light is incoherent —
											many different colors and different frequencies,
											sort of like the way you clapped initially —
											but if you were a laser, it would be rhythmic applause.
											It would be all atoms pulsating in unison,

											Hold your breath for me.
											What I have here are two empty water bottles.

											This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.

											Can you hear that?
											All right, so, I&#39;ve got a metronome,

											Maybe you&#39;d better listen to them. I&#39;ll stand here.
											What I&#39;m hoping is that they might just drift apart
											because their frequencies aren&#39;t perfectly the same.
											Right? They did.
											They were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart.
											And the reason is that they&#39;re not able to communicate.
											Now, you might think that&#39;s a bizarre idea.
											How can metronomes communicate?
											Well, they can communicate through mechanical forces.
											So I&#39;m going to give them a chance to do that.
											I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate?

											Now, that might seem a bit whimsical,
											but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order
											sometimes has unexpected consequences.
											And a clear case of that,
											was something that happened in London in the year 2000.
											The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London —
											a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames,
											first river crossing in over 100 years in London.
											There was a big competition for the design of this bridge,
											and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team —
											in the TED spirit, actually — of an architect —
											perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster —
											working with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro,
											and an engineering firm, Ove Arup.
											And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster&#39;s vision,
											which was — he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books,
											and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss,
											he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											He would shoot his light saber across the abyss, making a blade of light,
											and then scamper across on this blade of light.
											He said, &quot;That&#39;s the vision I want to give to London.
											I want a blade of light across the Thames.&quot;
											So they built the blade of light,
											and it&#39;s a very thin ribbon of steel, the world&#39;s —
											probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is,
											with cables that are out on the side.
											You&#39;re used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.
											These cables were on the side of the bridge,
											like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames —
											that&#39;s what&#39;s holding up this bridge.
											Now, everyone was very excited to try it out.
											On opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.
											And within two days the bridge was closed to the public.
											So I want to first show you some interviews with people
											who were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.

											Think of the bridge as being like this platform.

											Now, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome,
											but after all, we do walk like — I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk.
											And especially if we start to walk like those people did, right?
											They all showed this strange sort of skating gait
											that they adopted once the bridge started to move.
											And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.
											But also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you&#39;ll see an interesting clip

											Actually, I think the first person you&#39;ll see

											Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me,
											suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble
											in the same way as the real bridge —

											Interviewer: For a more convincing experiment,
											I wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team.
											Their instructions: just walk normally.
											It&#39;s really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it.
											They&#39;re all having some difficulty walking.
											And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.
											But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.
											You can&#39;t help it. You&#39;re actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step,
											and therefore to drive it to move further.
