									<p>
											Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean,
											no one — not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson —
											imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean
											by what we put into it or by what we took out of it.
											It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden,
											but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.

											I want to share with you
											my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us,
											and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we&#39;ve lost —
											actually, we&#39;ve taken, we&#39;ve eaten —
											more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea;
											why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared;
											why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific
											should concern not only the creatures that are dying,
											but it really should concern you.
											It does concern you, as well.

											I&#39;m haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls &quot;tomorrow&#39;s child,&quot;
											asking why we didn&#39;t do something on our watch
											to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean
											while there still was time.
											Well, now is that time.
											I hope for your help
											to explore and protect the wild ocean
											in ways that will restore the health and,
											in so doing, secure hope for humankind.
											Health to the ocean means health for us.

											For me, as a scientist,
											it all began in 1953
											when I first tried scuba.
											It&#39;s when I first got to know fish swimming
											in something other than lemon slices and butter.
											I actually love diving at night;
											you see a lot of fish then that you don&#39;t see in the daytime.
											Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970,
											when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time —
											at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.
											In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor
											while using this personal submersible called Jim.
											It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.
											It&#39;s one of my favorite bathing suits.

									<p>
											Since then, I&#39;ve used about 30 kinds of submarines
											and I&#39;ve started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search
											to design and build systems
											to access the deep sea.
											I led a five-year National Geographic expedition,
											the Sustainable Seas expeditions,
											using these little subs.

											I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain

											and then do everything he could
											to take care of his life support system;
											and then he pointed to this and he said, &quot;Life support system.&quot;

											Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers —

											And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park,
											the United States began establishing a system of parks
											that some say was the best idea America ever had.
											About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected:
											safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink,
											generating oxygen, protecting watersheds.
											And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea,
											National Marine Sanctuaries.
											That&#39;s another great idea.
											The good news is
											that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world,
											that have some kind of protection.
											And you can find them on Google Earth.
											The bad news is
											that you have to look hard to find them.
											In the last three years, for example,
											the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.
											But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent
											to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.
											Protected areas do rebound,

											or 200-year-old orange roughy.
											We don&#39;t consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.

											to search out hope spots,
											and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.

											The next 10 years may be the most important,

											And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is.

											and campaign to ignite public support
											for a global network of marine protected areas —
											hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean,

											How much?
											Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.
											You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?

											a fraction of one percent is not enough.
											My wish is a big wish,
