<title>Noreena Hertz: How to use experts -- and when not to | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>

But, says economist Noreena Hertz, relying too much on experts can be limiting and even dangerous. She calls for us to start democratizing expertise -- to listen not only to &quot;surgeons and CEOs, but also to shop staff.&quot;" />

<meta content='We make important decisions every day — and we often rely on experts to help us decide. But, says economist Noreena Hertz, relying too much on experts can be limiting and even dangerous.

											It&#39;s Monday morning.
											In Washington,
											the president of the United States
											is sitting in the Oval Office,
											assessing whether or not
											to strike Al Qaeda
											in Yemen.
											At Number 10 Downing Street,
											David Cameron is trying to work out
											whether to cut more public sector jobs
											in order to stave off a double-dip recession.
											In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez
											is standing at the door,
											listening to her baby crying and crying,
											trying to work out whether she should let it cry
											until it falls asleep
											or pick it up and hold it.
											And I am sitting by my father&#39;s bedside in hospital,
											trying to work out
											whether I should let him drink
											the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water
											that his doctors just came in and said,
											&quot;You must make him drink today,&quot; —
											my father&#39;s been nil by mouth for a week —
											or whether, by giving him this bottle,
											I might actually kill him.

											We face momentous decisions
											with important consequences
											throughout our lives,
											and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.
											We talk things over with our friends,
											we scour the Internet,
											we search through books.
											But still,
											even in this age
											of Google and TripAdvisor
											and Amazon Recommends,
											it&#39;s still experts
											that we rely upon most —
											especially when the stakes are high
											and the decision really matters.
											Because in a world of data deluge
											and extreme complexity,
											we believe that experts
											are more able to process information than we can —
											that they are able to come to better conclusions
											than we could come to on our own.
											And in an age
											that is sometimes nowadays frightening
											or confusing,
											we feel reassured
											by the almost parental-like authority
											of experts
											who tell us so clearly what it is
											we can and cannot do.

											But I believe
											that this is a big problem,
											a problem with potentially dangerous consequences
											for us as a society,
											as a culture
											and as individuals.
											It&#39;s not that experts
											have not massively contributed to the world —
											of course they have.
											The problem lies with us:
											we&#39;ve become addicted to experts.
											We&#39;ve become addicted to their certainty,
											their assuredness,
											their definitiveness,
											and in the process,
											we have ceded our responsibility,
											substituting our intellect
											and our intelligence
											for their supposed words of wisdom.
											We&#39;ve surrendered our power,
											trading off our discomfort
											with uncertainty
											for the illusion of certainty
											that they provide.
											This is no exaggeration.
											In a recent experiment,
											a group of adults
											had their brains scanned in an MRI machine
											as they were listening to experts speak.
											The results were quite extraordinary.
											As they listened to the experts&#39; voices,
											the independent decision-making parts of their brains
											switched off.
											It literally flat-lined.
											And they listened to whatever the experts said
											and took their advice, however right or wrong.

											But experts do get things wrong.
											Did you know that studies show
											that doctors misdiagnose
											four times out of 10?
											Did you know
											that if you file your tax returns yourself,
											you&#39;re statistically more likely
											to be filing them correctly
											than if you get a tax adviser
											to do it for you?
											And then there&#39;s, of course, the example
											that we&#39;re all too aware of:
											financial experts
											getting it so wrong
											that we&#39;re living through the worst recession
											since the 1930s.
											For the sake of our health,
											our wealth
											and our collective security,
											it&#39;s imperative that we keep
											the independent decision-making parts of our brains
											switched on.
											And I&#39;m saying this as an economist
											who, over the past few years,
											has focused my research
											on what it is we think
											and who it is we trust and why,
											but also —
											and I&#39;m aware of the irony here —
											as an expert myself,
											as a professor,
											as somebody who advises prime ministers,
											heads of big companies,
											international organizations,
											but an expert who believes
											that the role of experts needs to change,
											that we need to become more open-minded,
											more democratic
											and be more open
											to people rebelling against
											our points of view.
											So in order to help you understand
											where I&#39;m coming from,
											let me bring you into my world,
											the world of experts.

											Now there are, of course, exceptions,
											wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.
											But what my research has shown me
											is that experts tend on the whole
											to form very rigid camps,
											that within these camps,
											a dominant perspective emerges
											that often silences opposition,
											that experts move with the prevailing winds,
											often hero-worshipping
											their own gurus.
											Alan Greenspan&#39;s proclamations
											that the years of economic growth
											would go on and on,
											not challenged by his peers,
											until after the crisis, of course.
											You see,
											we also learn
											that experts are located,
											are governed,
											by the social and cultural norms
											of their times —
											whether it be the doctors
											in Victorian England, say,
											who sent women to asylums
											for expressing sexual desire,
											or the psychiatrists in the United States
											who, up until 1973,
											were still categorizing homosexuality
											as a mental illness.

											And what all this means
											is that paradigms
											take far too long to shift,
											that complexity and nuance are ignored
											and also that money talks —
											because we&#39;ve all seen the evidence
											of pharmaceutical companies
											funding studies of drugs
											that conveniently leave out
											their worst side effects,
											or studies funded by food companies
											of their new products,
											massively exaggerating the health benefits
											of the products they&#39;re about to bring by market.
											The study showed that food companies exaggerated
											typically seven times more
											than an independent study.

											And we&#39;ve also got to be aware
											that experts, of course,
											also make mistakes.
											They make mistakes every single day —
											mistakes born out of carelessness.
											A recent study in the Archives of Surgery
											reported surgeons
											removing healthy ovaries,
											operating on the wrong side of the brain,
											carrying out procedures on the wrong hand,
											elbow, eye, foot,
											and also mistakes born out of thinking errors.
											A common thinking error
											of radiologists, for example —
											when they look at CT scans —
											is that they&#39;re overly influenced
											by whatever it is
											that the referring physician has said
											that he suspects
											the patient&#39;s problem to be.
											So if a radiologist
											is looking at the scan
											of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say,
											what happens is that,
											if they see evidence
											of pneumonia on the scan,
											they literally stop looking at it —
											thereby missing the tumor
											sitting three inches below
											on the patient&#39;s lungs.

											I&#39;ve shared with you so far
											some insights into the world of experts.
											These are, of course,
											not the only insights I could share,
											but I hope they give you a clear sense at least
											of why we need to stop kowtowing to them,
											why we need to rebel
											and why we need to switch
											our independent decision-making capabilities on.
											But how can we do this?
											Well for the sake of time,
											I want to focus on just three strategies.
											First, we&#39;ve got to be ready and willing
											to take experts on
											and dispense with this notion of them
											as modern-day apostles.
											This doesn&#39;t mean having to get a Ph.D.
											in every single subject,
											you&#39;ll be relieved to hear.
											But it does mean persisting
											in the face of their inevitable annoyance
											when, for example,
											we want them to explain things to us
											in language that we can actually understand.
											Why was it that, when I had an operation,
											my doctor said to me,
											&quot;Beware, Ms. Hertz,
											of hyperpyrexia,&quot;
											when he could have just as easily said,
											&quot;Watch out for a high fever.&quot;
											You see, being ready to take experts on
											is about also being willing
											to dig behind their graphs,
											their equations, their forecasts,
											their prophecies,
											and being armed with the questions to do that —
											questions like:
											What are the assumptions that underpin this?
											What is the evidence upon which this is based?
											What has your investigation focused on?
											And what has it ignored?
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											It recently came out
											that experts trialing drugs
											before they come to market
											typically trial drugs
											first, primarily on male animals
											and then, primarily on men.
											It seems that they&#39;ve somehow overlooked the fact
											that over half the world&#39;s population are women.
											And women have drawn the short medical straw
											because it now turns out that many of these drugs
											don&#39;t work nearly as well on women
											as they do on men —
											and the drugs that do work well work so well
											that they&#39;re actively harmful for women to take.
											Being a rebel is about recognizing
											that experts&#39; assumptions
											and their methodologies
											can easily be flawed.

									<p>
											Second,
											we need to create the space
											for what I call &quot;managed dissent.&quot;
											If we are to shift paradigms,
											if we are to make breakthroughs,
											if we are to destroy myths,
											we need to create an environment
											in which expert ideas are battling it out,
											in which we&#39;re bringing in
											new, diverse, discordant, heretical views
											into the discussion,
											fearlessly,
											in the knowledge that progress comes about,
											not only from the creation of ideas,
											but also from their destruction —
											and also from the knowledge
											that, by surrounding ourselves
											by divergent, discordant,
											heretical views.
											All the research now shows us
											that this actually makes us smarter.
											Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion
											because it goes against our very instincts,
											which are to surround ourselves
											with opinions and advice
											that we already believe
											or want to be true.
											And that&#39;s why I talk about the need
											to actively manage dissent.

											Google CEO Eric Schmidt
											is a practical practitioner
											of this philosophy.
											In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room —
											arms crossed, looking a bit bemused —
											and draws them into the discussion,
											trying to see if they indeed are
											the person with a different opinion,
											so that they have dissent within the room.
											Managing dissent
											is about recognizing the value
											of disagreement, discord
											and difference.
											But we need to go even further.
											We need to fundamentally redefine
											who it is that experts are.
											The conventional notion
											is that experts are people
											with advanced degrees,
											fancy titles, diplomas,
											best-selling books —
											high-status individuals.
											But just imagine
											if we were to junk
											this notion of expertise
											as some sort of elite cadre
											and instead embrace the notion
											of democratized expertise —
											whereby expertise was not just the preserve
											of surgeons and CEO&#39;s,
											but also shop-girls — yeah.

											Best Buy,
											the consumer electronics company,
											gets all its employees —
											the cleaners, the shop assistants,
											the people in the back office,
											not just its forecasting team —
											to place bets, yes bets,
											on things like whether or not
											a product is going to sell well before Christmas,
											on whether customers&#39; new ideas
											are going to be or should be taken on by the company,
											on whether a project
											will come in on time.
											By leveraging
											and by embracing
											the expertise within the company,
											Best Buy was able to discover, for example,
											that the store that it was going to open in China —
											its big, grand store —
											was not going to open on time.
											Because when it asked its staff,
											all its staff, to place their bets
											on whether they thought the store would open on time or not,
											a group from the finance department
											placed all their chips
											on that not happening.
											It turned out that they were aware,
											as no one else within the company was,

											that neither the forecasting experts,

											The strategies
											that I have discussed this evening —
											embracing dissent,
											taking experts on,
											democratizing expertise,
											rebellious strategies —
											are strategies that I think
											would serve us all well to embrace
											as we try to deal with the challenges
											of these very confusing, complex,
											difficult times.
											For if we keep
											our independent decision-making part
											of our brains switched on,
											if we challenge experts, if we&#39;re skeptical,
											if we devolve authority,
											if we are rebellious,
											but also
											if we become much more comfortable
											with nuance,
											uncertainty and doubt,
											and if we allow our experts
											to express themselves
											using those terms too,
											we will set ourselves up
											much better
											for the challenges of the 21st century.
											For now, more than ever,
											is not the time
											to be blindly following,
											blindly accepting,
											blindly trusting.
											Now is the time to face the world
											with eyes wide open —
											yes, using experts
											to help us figure things out, for sure —
											I don&#39;t want to completely do myself out of a job here —
											but being aware
											of their limitations
											and, of course, also our own.
