											Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.
											I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely
											to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?
											I think it&#39;s extremely important that we have sustainable transport
											and sustainable energy production.
											That sort of overall sustainable energy problem
											is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,
											independent of environmental concerns.
											In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,
											given that we&#39;re going to run out of hydrocarbons,
											we need to find some sustainable means of operating.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											EM: Right. There&#39;s two elements to that answer.
											One is that, even if you take the same source fuel
											and produce power at the power plant
											and use it to charge electric cars, you&#39;re still better off.
											So if you take, say, natural gas,
											which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,
											if you burn that in a modern
											General Electric natural gas turbine,
											you&#39;ll get about 60 percent efficiency.
											If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,
											you get about 20 percent efficiency.
											And the reason is, in the stationary power plant,
											you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,
											is voluminous,
											and you can take the waste heat
											and run a steam turbine and generate
											a secondary power source.
											So in effect, even after you&#39;ve taken transmission loss into account and everything,
											even using the same source fuel, you&#39;re at least twice as better off
											charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.

											EM: Yes, it does.

											as the mode of transport.

											EM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,
											and I should say that I think, actually,
											all modes of transport will become fully electric
											with the ironic exception of rockets.
											There&#39;s just no way around Newton&#39;s third law.
											The question is how do you accelerate
											the advent of electric transport?
											And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with
											a really energy efficient car,
											so that means making it incredibly light,
											and so what you&#39;re seeing here
											is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car
											made in North America.
											In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques
											to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.
											And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient
											of any car of its size.
											So as a result, the energy usage is very low,
											and it has the most advanced battery pack,
											and that&#39;s what gives it the range that&#39;s competitive,
											so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.

											version two is medium priced and medium volume,
											and then version three would be low price, high volume.
											So we&#39;re at step two at this point.
											So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.
											Then we&#39;ve got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.
											And our third generation car, which should hopefully
											be out in about three or four years

											All rockets that fly today are fully expendable.
											The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,
											but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,
											and the parts that were reusable
											took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.
											So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.

											CA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause)
											And so what a lot of people don&#39;t realize is,
											the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small.
											It&#39;s much like on a jet.
											So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent
											of the cost of the rocket.
											So it&#39;s possible to achieve, let&#39;s say,
											roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight
											if you can effectively reuse the rocket.
											That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important.
											Every mode of transport that we use,
											whether it&#39;s planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,
											is reusable, but not rockets.
											So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization.

											EM: Well, thanks. Thank you.
											Well, I do think there&#39;s a good framework for thinking.
											It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning.
											Generally I think there are — what I mean by that is,
											boil things down to their fundamental truths
											and reason up from there,
											as opposed to reasoning by analogy.
											Through most of our life, we get through life
											by reasoning by analogy,
											which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations.
											And you have to do that.
											Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn&#39;t be able to get through the day.
											But when you want to do something new,
											you have to apply the physics approach.
											Physics is really figuring out how to discover
											new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics.
											It&#39;s really counterintuitive.
											So I think that&#39;s an important thing to do,
											and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback,
											and solicit it, particularly from friends.
											This may sound like simple advice,
											but hardly anyone does that,
											and it&#39;s incredibly helpful.
