											I have a vision for each one of you,

											that as you go through the day,
											you can literally sink
to your knees in gratitude
											at the tremendous good fortune
that&#39;s been bestowed on you;
											that as you go through the day,
											you become radiantly alive several times.
											And if your life isn&#39;t like that,

											When I conduct this experiment,
a bunch of stuff comes up:

											Right now, if you were to think about it,

											I would like you to consider this:

you can get, you can un-get.

Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow.

											Let me repeat that: you have spent
your entire life learning to be unhappy.

											A mental model is a notion we have
that this is the way the world works.
											All of us have mental models,
we&#39;ve got dozens of mental models.
											We&#39;ve got mental models
on how to find a job,
											how to get ahead at work,
how to pick a restaurant to eat at,
											how to have a movie
to go to ... dozens of them.
											The problem isn&#39;t
that we have mental models.
											The problem is that we don&#39;t know
that we have mental models.
											We think this is the way the world works.
											And the more we invest in a mental model,
											the more it appears that this, in fact,
is the way the world works.
											But it isn&#39;t: it&#39;s just a mental model,
											and the mental model we have
that we buy into so strongly
											is that we have to get something
so we can do something
											so we can be something.
											Like, we have to get a great deal of money
so we can travel to exotic places
											so we can be happy.
											We have to be in a relationship
so we can have great sex
											so we can be happy.

											Well, we live in a world
where what we think of,

											here I am, here is where I want to go,
											these are the steps I have to take
in order to get from where I am

											life is no good, life sucks.
											True? False?
											That is how we live.
											We invest in the outcome,
											and as I&#39;ve just pointed out,
											the outcome is frequently different
from what we would like,
											and sometimes the diametric opposite
of what we would like.
											You invest in the outcome

											There is an alternative.
											And the alternative is that you do not
invest in the outcome,
											you invest in the process.
											And the best way to describe that
is a quote by John Wooden.
											I don&#39;t know how many of you
are familiar with John Wooden.
											He&#39;s very well-known in the United States
											and certainly among basketball fans.
											He&#39;s the only person ever to make
the basketball Hall of Fame
											both as a player and as a coach.
											And what he told his entering team —
											he led UCLA to an unprecedented number
of victories and finals in the NCAA —
											and what he used to tell any new team
is he never spoke about winning.
											He always said, &quot;When it&#39;s over
and you look in the mirror,
											did you do the best
that you were capable of?
											And if you did the best
that you were capable of,
											the score doesn&#39;t matter.
											But I would suspect that if you did
the best that you were capable of,
											you will find the score to your liking.&quot;
											That is investing in a process.

to do whatever you can,
											but you are always focusing
on, &quot;This is the outcome.&quot;
											Now, focusing on the outcome is fine.
											It gives you direction.

											And if you have children — raise
your hands if you have children.
											Have you ever seen
a small child learn to walk?
											What happens, and this happens
typically between 11 and 13 months,
											is the child gets up
and she sees everybody walking,
											she wants to walk, she gets up,
she falls down, she starts crying
											and momma runs up and comforts her,
kisses the place, makes it well.
											She tries again, falls down,
mommy runs up again.
											After some time, mommy feels tired
and no longer runs up
											and the child stops crying,
											and then she gets up, takes a step
											and doesn&#39;t fall down,
and then she takes another,
											and a beautiful smile comes on her face.
											And very soon, generally within 24 hours,
she&#39;s walking all over the place,
											upsetting your living room arrangements.
											And you know you&#39;ve gone
to a new stage of parenting.
											Right?

											Now, imagine what would happen
											if each time the child fell,
											she would say, &quot;Oh my God, I failed again.
											I&#39;m never going to learn to walk.&quot;
											And you have to get counseling for her
											to help her deal with
feelings of inadequacy
											and not being able to achieve
and fail yet again.
											How long do you think it would take her
to learn to walk if you had to do that,
											if every three times she fell down,
you had to get a counselor
											to counsel her and so on?
											Sounds funny, doesn&#39;t it?
											But that is exactly what we&#39;re doing.
											What the child is doing
is focusing on the process.
