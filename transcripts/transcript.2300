<title>Sofia Jawed-Wessel: The lies we tell pregnant women | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: &quot;When we tell women that sex isn&#39;t worth the risk during pregnancy, what we&#39;re telling her is that her sexual pleasure doesn&#39;t matter ... that she in fact doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; says sex researcher Sofia Jawed-Wessel. In this eye-opening talk, Jawed-Wessel mines our views about pregnancy and pleasure to lay bare the relationship between women, sex and systems of power." />

<meta content='"When we tell women that sex isn&#x0027;t worth the risk during pregnancy, what we&#x0027;re telling her is that her sexual pleasure doesn&#x0027;t matter ... that she in fact doesn&#x0027;t matter," says sex researcher Sofia Jawed-Wessel. In this eye-opening talk, Jawed-Wessel mines our views about pregnancy and pleasure to lay bare the relationship between women, sex and systems of power.' itemprop='description'>

											This concept, called objectification,
											is the foundation of sexism,
											and we see it reinforced
through every aspect of our lives.
											We see it in the government
											that refuses to punish men
											for raping women.
											We see it in advertisements.
											How many of you have seen an advertisement
											that uses a woman&#39;s breast
to sell an entirely unrelated product?
											Or movie after movie after movie
											that portrays women
as only love interests?
											These examples might seem
inconsequential and harmless,
											but they&#39;re insidious,
											slowly building into a culture
that refuses to see women as people.
											We see this in the school
that sends home a 10-year-old girl
											because her clothes were
a distraction to boys trying to learn,
											or the government that refuses
to punish men for raping women
											over and over,
											or the woman who is killed
											because she asked a man to stop
grinding on her on the dance floor.

											Media plays a large role in perpetuating
the objectification of women.
											Let&#39;s consider
the classic romantic comedy.
											We&#39;re typically introduced
to two kinds of women in these movies,
											two kinds of desirable women, anyway.
											The first is the sexy bombshell.
											This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman
with the perfect body.
											Our leading man
has no trouble identifying her
											and even less trouble having sex with her.
											The second is our leading lady,
											the beautiful but demure woman
our leading man falls in love with
											despite not noticing her at first
											or not liking her if he did.
											The first is the slut.
											She is to be consumed and forgotten.
											She is much too available.
											The second is desirable but modest,
											and therefore worthy
of our leading man&#39;s future babies.
											Marriage material.
											We&#39;re actually told
that women have two roles,
											but these two roles have a difficult time
existing within the same woman.

											That last one really stuck with me.
											We might think that because we divorce
pregnant women and moms from sexuality,
											we are removing the constraints
of sexual objectification.
											They experience less sexism. Right?
											Not exactly.
											What happens instead
is a different kind of objectification.
											In my efforts to explain this to others,
											one conversation
led to the Venus of Willendorf,
											a Paleolithic figurine scholars assumed
was a goddess of love and beauty,
											hence the name Venus.
											This theory was later revised, though,
											when scholars noted
the sculptor&#39;s obvious focus
											on the figurine&#39;s reproductive features:
											large breasts,
considered ideal for nursing;
											a round, possibly pregnant belly;
											the remnants of red dye,
alluding to menstruation or birth.
											They also assumed that she was
meant to be held or placed lying down
											because her tiny feet
don&#39;t allow her to be freestanding.
											She also had no face.
											For this reason, it was assumed
that she was a representation of fertility
											and not a portrait of a person.
											She was an object.
											In the history of her interpretation,
											she went from object
of ideal beauty and love
											to object of reproduction.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I think this transition speaks more
											about the scholars
who have interpreted her purpose
											than the actual purpose
of the figurine herself.
											When a woman becomes pregnant,
											she leaves the realm
of men&#39;s sexual desire
											and slides into her reproductive
and child-rearing role.
											In doing so, she also becomes
											the property of the community,
											considered very important
but only because she&#39;s pregnant. Right?
											I&#39;ve taken to calling this
the Willendorf effect,
											and once again we see it reinforced
in many aspects of her life.
