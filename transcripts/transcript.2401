											What do we do about it?
											Well for most adults,
it&#39;s a relatively mild disease —
											a little fever, a little headache,
joint pain, maybe a rash.
											In fact, most people who get it
don&#39;t even know they&#39;ve had it.
											But the more we find out
about the Zika virus
											the more terrifying it becomes.
											For example, doctors
have noticed an uptick
											of something called Guillain-Barré
syndrome in recent outbreaks.
											In Guillain-Barré, your immune system
attacks your nerve cells
											it can partially
or even totally paralyze you.
											Fortunately, that&#39;s quite rare,
and most people recover.
											But if you&#39;re pregnant
when you&#39;re infected
											you&#39;re at risk of something terrible.
											Indeed, a child with a deformed head.

											Here&#39;s that infant
with what&#39;s called microcephaly.
											a brain in a head that&#39;s too small.
											And there&#39;s no known cure.
											It was actually doctors
in northeastern Brazil
											who first noticed, just a year ago,
after a Zika outbreak,
											that there was a peak
in the incidence of microcephaly.
											It took medical doctors another year
											to be sure that it was caused
by the Zika virus,
											but they&#39;re now sure.

											So where did it come from,
and how did it get here?
											And it is here.
											Like many of our viruses,
it came out of Africa,
											specifically the Zika forest in Uganda.
											Researchers at the nearby
Yellow Fever Research Institute
											identified an unknown virus
in a monkey in the Zika forest
											which is how it got its name.
											The first human cases of Zika fever
											surfaced a few years later
in Uganda-Tanzania.
											The virus then spread through West Africa
											and east through equatorial Asia —
Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.
											But it was still mostly in monkeys
and, of course, mosquitoes.
											In fact in the 60 years between the time
it was first identified in 1947 and 2007
											there were only 13 reported cases
of human Zika fever.
											And then something extraordinary happened
on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands.
											There was an outbreak that affected
fully 75 percent of the population.
											How did it get there? By air.
											Today we have two billion
commercial airline passengers.
											An infected passenger can board a plane,
fly halfway around the world
											before developing symptoms —
if they develop symptoms at all.
											Then when they land, the local mosquitoes
begin to bite them and spread the fever.
											Zika fever then next surfaced
in 2013 in French Polynesia.
											By December of that year, it was being
transmitted locally by the mosquitoes.
											That led to an explosive outbreak in which
almost 30,000 people were affected.
											From there it radiated around the Pacific.
											There were outbreaks in the Cook
Islands, in New Caledonia,
											in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands
											and almost all the way around to the coast
of South America and Easter Island.
											And then, in early 2015,
											there was an upsurge of cases
of a dengue-like syndrome
											in the city of Natal
in northeastern Brazil.
											The virus wasn&#39;t dengue, it was Zika,
and it spread rapidly —
											Recife down the coast, a big metropolitan
center, soon became the epicenter.
											Well people have speculated that it was
2014 World Cup soccer fans
											that brought the virus into the country.
											But others have speculated that perhaps
it was Pacific Islanders
											participating in championship canoe races
											that were held in Rio that year
that brought it in.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well today, this is only a year later.
											The virus is being locally transmitted
by mosquitoes
											virtually throughout South America,
Central America, Mexico
											and the Caribbean Islands
											Until this year, the many
thousands of cases
											that have been diagnosed in the US
were contracted elsewhere.
											But as of this summer, it&#39;s being
transmitted locally in Miami.
											It&#39;s here.

									<p>
											So what do we do about it?
											Well, preventing infection
											is either about protecting people
or about eliminating the mosquitoes.
											Let&#39;s focus on people first.
											You can get vaccinated.
											You can not travel to Zika areas.
											Or you can cover up
and apply insect repellent.
											Getting vaccinated is not an option,
because there isn&#39;t a vaccine yet
											and there probably won&#39;t be
for a couple of years.
											Staying home isn&#39;t
a foolproof protection either
											because we now know that
it can be sexually transmitted.
											Covering up and applying
insect repellent does work ...

											(Laughter)
											So that leaves the mosquitoes,
and here&#39;s how we control them now:
											spraying insecticides.
											The protective gear is necessary
because these are toxic chemicals
											that kill people as well as bugs.
											Although it does take quite a lot more
to kill a person than to kill a bug.
											These are pictures from
Brazil and Nicaragua.
											But it looks the same in Miami, Florida.
											And we of course can spray
insecticides from planes.
											Last summer, mosquito control officials
in Dorchester County, South Carolina,
											authorized spraying of Naled,
an insecticide,
											early one morning,
as recommended by the manufacturer.
											Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters
											that her bee yard looked
like it had been nuked.
											Oops.
											Bees are the good guys.
											The citizens of Florida protested,
but spraying continued.
											Unfortunately, so did the increase
in the number of Zika fever cases.
											That&#39;s because insecticides
aren&#39;t very effective.

											So are there any approaches that are
perhaps more effective than spraying
											but with less downsides
than toxic chemicals?
											I&#39;m a huge fan of biological controls,
											and I share that view with Rachel Carson,
author of &quot;Silent Spring,&quot;
											the book that is credited with starting
the environmental movement.
											In this book she tells the story,
as an example,
											of how a very nasty insect
pest of livestock
											was eliminated in the last century.
											No one knows that
extraordinary story today.
											So Jack Block and I,
when we were writing an editorial
											about the mosquito problem today,
retold that story.
											And in capsule form, it&#39;s that pupae —
that&#39;s the immature form of the insect —
											were irradiated until they were sterile,
grown to adulthood
											and then released from planes
all over the Southwest,
											the Southeast and down into Mexico
and into Central America
											literally by the hundreds of millions
from little airplanes,
											eventually eliminating
that terrible insect pest
											for most of the Western Hemisphere.
											Our real purpose in writing this editorial
											was to introduce readers
to how we can do that today —
											not with radiation
but with our knowledge of genetics.
											Let me explain.

											This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti.
											It&#39;s the most common insect
vector of diseases,
											not just Zika but dengue,
Chikungunya, West Nile virus
											and that ancient plague, yellow fever.
											It&#39;s an urban mosquito,
											and it&#39;s the female
that does the dirty work.
											She bites to get a blood meal
to feed her offspring.
											Males don&#39;t bite; they don&#39;t even
have the mouth parts to bite.
											A little British company called Oxitec
genetically modified that mosquito
											so that when it mates with a wild female,
its eggs don&#39;t develop to adulthood.
											Let me show you.
											This is the normal reproductive cycle.
											Oxitec designed the mosquito so that
when the male mates with the wild female
											the eggs don&#39;t develop.
											Sounds impossible?
											Well let me show you
just diagrammatically how they do it.
											Now this represents the nucleus
of a mosquito cell,
											and that tangle in the middle
represents its genome,
											the sum total of its genes.
											Scientists added a single gene
											that codes for a protein represented
by this orange ball
											that feeds back on itself
to keep cranking out more of that protein.
											The extra copies, however,
go and gum up the mosquitoes&#39; genes,
											killing the organism.
											To keep it alive in the laboratory
they use a compound called tetracycline.
											Tetracycline shuts off that gene
and allows normal development.
											They added another little wrinkle
so that they could study what happens.
											And that is they added a gene
that makes the insect glow under UV light
											so that when they released it
they could follow exactly how far it went
											how long it lived
and all of the kinds of data
											for a good scientific study.
											Now this is the pupal stage,
and at this stage
											the females are larger than the males.
											That allows them to sort them
into the males and the females
											and they allow only the males
to grow to adulthood.
											And let me remind you
that males don&#39;t bite.
											From there it&#39;s pretty simple.
											They take beakers full of male mosquitoes,
											load them into milk cartons,
and drive around the city,
											releasing them guided by GPS.
											Here&#39;s the mayor of a city
releasing the first batch
											of what they call the &quot;friendly Aedes.&quot;
											Now I wish I could tell you
this is an American city, but it&#39;s not.
											It&#39;s Piracicaba, Brazil.
											The amazing thing is that in just a year
											it brought down the cases
of dengue by 91 percent.
											That&#39;s better than any insecticide
spraying can do.

											So why aren&#39;t we using this remarkable
biological control in the US?
											That&#39;s because it&#39;s a GMO:
a genetically modified organism.
											Notice the subtitle here says
if the FDA would let them
											they could do the same thing here,
when Zika arrives.
											And of course it has arrived.
											So now I have to tell you the short form
											of the long, torturous story
of GM regulation in the US
											In the US, there are three agencies that
regulate genetically modified organisms:
											the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,
											the EPA, the Environmental
Protection Agency,
											and the USDA, US Department
of Agriculture.
											Took these folks two years
to decide that it would be the FDA
											that would regulate the genetically
modified mosquito.
											And they would do it as a new animal drug,
if that makes any sense.
											Took them another five years going back
and forth and back and forth
											to convince the FDA
that this would not harm people,
											and it would not harm the environment.
											They finally gave them, this summer,
permission to run a little test
											in the Florida Keys,
											where they had been invited years earlier
when they Keys had an outbreak of dengue.
											Would that it were that easy.
											When the local residents heard
											that there would be genetically modified
mosquitoes tested in their community
											some of them began to organize protests.
											They even organized a petition on
the internet with this cuddly logo,
											which eventually accumulated
some 160,000 signatures
											And they demanded a referendum
											which will be conducted
in just a couple of weeks
											about whether the trials
would be permitted at all.

											Well it&#39;s Miami that really needs
these better ways of controlling insects.
											And there the attitudes are changing.
											In fact, very recently a bipartisan group
of more than 60 legislators
											wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell
											asking that she, at the Federal level,
expedite access for Florida
											to this new technology.

									<p>
											So the bottom line is this:
											biological control of harmful insects
											can be both more effective and
very much more environmentally friendly
											than using insecticides,
which are toxic chemicals.
											That was true in Rachel Carson&#39;s
time; it&#39;s true today.
											What&#39;s different is that we have
enormously more information
											about genetics than we had then,
											and therefore more ability
to use that information
											to affect these biological controls.
											And I hope that what I&#39;ve done
is aroused your curiosity enough
											to start your own inquiry —
not into just GM mosquitoes
											but to the other genetically modified
organisms that are so controversial today.
											I think if you do that, and you dig down
through all of the misinformation,
											and the marketing
											on the part of the organic food industry
and the Greenpeaces
											and find the science,
the accurate science,
											you&#39;ll be surprised and pleased.

With former Secretary of Agriculture Jack Block, she recently published a <em>New York Times</em> editorial titled &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/opinion/mosquito-vs-mosquito-in-the-battle-over-the-zika-virus.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mosquito vs. Mosquito in the Battle Over the Zika Virus</a>.&quot;</p><p>Fedoroff was trained as a molecular biologist and geneticist at the Rockefeller University in New York City. The university awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2008 as one of its most distinguished alumni on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.</p><p>Fedoroff&#39;s early scientific accomplishments include analyzing a curious enzyme that replicates the RNA genome of a tiny RNA virus and sequencing of one the first genes ever to be sequenced. On the strength of this work, she was appointed a member of the scientific staff of the Carnegie Institution for Science&rsquo;s Department of Embryology. Her most important contributions began when she met the legendary biologist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/read/4990/chapter/11/\" target=\"_blank\">Barbara McClintock</a>&nbsp;in 1978. She was intrigued by McClintock&rsquo;s pioneering work on transposable elements, commonly known as &quot;jumping genes,&quot; in corn plants.</p><p>McClintock&#39;s work was purely genetic, hence Fedoroff set out to study her jumping genes at the molecular level. That meant figuring out how to clone plant genes, none of which had yet been cloned. In fact, people had begun to wonder whether plant genes could be cloned at all. Solving the technical problems, Fedoroff and her students unraveled the molecular details of how these mobile DNA sequences move and how the plants exert epigenetic control of their movement. This work led to her election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1990. Her capstone book on transposable elements entitled&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/p5kzScG\" target=\"_blank\">Plant Transposons and Genome Dynamics in Evolution</a>&nbsp;,</em>was published in 2013.</p><p>Fedoroff moved the Penn State University in 1995 as the Director of the Biotechnology Institute and Vern M. Willaman Chair in Life Sciences. Here she organized a multidisciplinary graduate and research program now known as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.huck.psu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Huck Institute of the Life Sciences</a>. Her laboratory research shifted to understanding how plants respond to stress and how they process small regulatory RNAs from larger precursors. She also began to dance Argentine tango. And she wrote a book with science writer Nancy Marie Brown titled&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/DEamyA\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mendel in the Kitchen: A Scientist&rsquo;s View of Genetically Modified Foods</em></a>.</p><p>The year 2007 was marked by two extraordinary events in Fedoroff&#39;s life. She was named a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalmedals.org/laureates/nina-v-fedoroff/\" target=\"_blank\">National Medal of Science</a>&nbsp;laureate for 2006 and she was appointed as the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://science.psu.edu/news-and-events/2007-news/Fedoroff7-2007-2.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State</a>&nbsp;by then-Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice. The science advisory position gave her an unexpected bully pulpit to talk about the importance of science in diplomacy, about which she was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/science/19conv.html/\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a>&nbsp;by Claudia Dreifus of the <em>New York Times</em>. It also gave her many opportunities to talk about genetic modification and GMOs all over the world. Realizing that development efforts would benefit from increased involvement of scientists, she organized the GKI, an NGO that builds collaborative networks around problems requiring scientific and technological input.</p><p>Completing her advisory work at the State Department in 2010, Fedoroff was recruited to the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/\" target=\"_blank\">King Abdullah University of Science</a>&nbsp;and Technology (KAUST) as a Distinguished Professor of the Life Sciences.

Modern methods of genetic modifications and the GMOs produced using them have evoked an unprecedented level of societal controversy. Individuals and organizations opposed to using biotechnology have made effective use of scare tactics, with the result that there is a general perception throughout the world that there's something bad about GMOs. Indeed, a recent Pew poll revealed that even though almost 90 percent of scientists had a positive view of GMOs, that view was shared by less than 40 percent of the public. The curious reader, then, has the tough task of recognizing his or her own beliefs about GMOs, figuring out whether they comport with the scientific consensus, and, if so inclined, reconstructing them on a foundation of up-to-date science.

With former Secretary of Agriculture Jack Block, she recently published a <em>New York Times</em> editorial titled &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/opinion/mosquito-vs-mosquito-in-the-battle-over-the-zika-virus.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mosquito vs. Mosquito in the Battle Over the Zika Virus</a>.&quot;</p><p>Fedoroff was trained as a molecular biologist and geneticist at the Rockefeller University in New York City. The university awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2008 as one of its most distinguished alumni on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.</p><p>Fedoroff&#39;s early scientific accomplishments include analyzing a curious enzyme that replicates the RNA genome of a tiny RNA virus and sequencing of one the first genes ever to be sequenced. On the strength of this work, she was appointed a member of the scientific staff of the Carnegie Institution for Science&rsquo;s Department of Embryology. Her most important contributions began when she met the legendary biologist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/read/4990/chapter/11/\" target=\"_blank\">Barbara McClintock</a>&nbsp;in 1978. She was intrigued by McClintock&rsquo;s pioneering work on transposable elements, commonly known as &quot;jumping genes,&quot; in corn plants.</p><p>McClintock&#39;s work was purely genetic, hence Fedoroff set out to study her jumping genes at the molecular level. That meant figuring out how to clone plant genes, none of which had yet been cloned. In fact, people had begun to wonder whether plant genes could be cloned at all. Solving the technical problems, Fedoroff and her students unraveled the molecular details of how these mobile DNA sequences move and how the plants exert epigenetic control of their movement. This work led to her election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1990. Her capstone book on transposable elements entitled&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/p5kzScG\" target=\"_blank\">Plant Transposons and Genome Dynamics in Evolution</a>&nbsp;,</em>was published in 2013.</p><p>Fedoroff moved the Penn State University in 1995 as the Director of the Biotechnology Institute and Vern M. Willaman Chair in Life Sciences. Here she organized a multidisciplinary graduate and research program now known as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.huck.psu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Huck Institute of the Life Sciences</a>. Her laboratory research shifted to understanding how plants respond to stress and how they process small regulatory RNAs from larger precursors. She also began to dance Argentine tango. And she wrote a book with science writer Nancy Marie Brown titled&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/DEamyA\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mendel in the Kitchen: A Scientist&rsquo;s View of Genetically Modified Foods</em></a>.</p><p>The year 2007 was marked by two extraordinary events in Fedoroff&#39;s life. She was named a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalmedals.org/laureates/nina-v-fedoroff/\" target=\"_blank\">National Medal of Science</a>&nbsp;laureate for 2006 and she was appointed as the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://science.psu.edu/news-and-events/2007-news/Fedoroff7-2007-2.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State</a>&nbsp;by then-Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice. The science advisory position gave her an unexpected bully pulpit to talk about the importance of science in diplomacy, about which she was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/science/19conv.html/\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a>&nbsp;by Claudia Dreifus of the <em>New York Times</em>. It also gave her many opportunities to talk about genetic modification and GMOs all over the world. Realizing that development efforts would benefit from increased involvement of scientists, she organized the GKI, an NGO that builds collaborative networks around problems requiring scientific and technological input.</p><p>Completing her advisory work at the State Department in 2010, Fedoroff was recruited to the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/\" target=\"_blank\">King Abdullah University of Science</a>&nbsp;and Technology (KAUST) as a Distinguished Professor of the Life Sciences. At KAUST, Fedoroff organized a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cda.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Desert Agriculture</a>, seeking to address the difficulties facing agriculture in increasingly populous dryland areas.</p><p>Today Fedoroff continues write and lecture internationally, most recently keynoting the 2017&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.eventbu.com/mantua/food-science-festival-mantova-5-6-7-maggio-2017/2665190.amp/\" target=\"_blank\">Mantua Food and Science Festival</a>&nbsp;in Mantua, Italy. She continues to dance tango, traveling to Buenos Aires each of the past couple of years.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Nina Fedoroff","tags":["biology","biotech","disease","environment","genetics","epidemiology","global issues","health","illness","molecular biology","insects","public health","monkeys","technology","science","virus","society","TEDx"],"title":"A secret weapon against Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1008909}]}
