											MR: Right. I always
loved space technology,
											and satellites, to me, are sort of
like the canoes that our ancestors
											first pushed out into the water.
											So it was exciting for me
to be part of the navigation
											of the oceans of the sky,
											and as I developed different types
of satellite communication systems,
											the main thing I did was to launch
bigger and more powerful satellites,
											the consequence of which
was that the receiving antennas
											could be smaller and smaller,
											and after going through
direct television broadcasting,
											I had the idea that if we could make
a more powerful satellite,
											the receiving dish could be so small
											that it would just be a section
of a parabolic dish,
											a flat little plate embedded
into the roof of an automobile,
											and it would be possible to have
nationwide satellite radio,
											and that&#39;s Sirius XM today.

											MR: My thesis in this book is that there
are seven billion people in the world,

to express one&#39;s gender.
											And while people may have
the genitals of a male or a female,
											the genitals don&#39;t determine your gender
											or even really your sexual identity.
											That&#39;s just a matter of anatomy
											and reproductive tracts,
											and people could choose
whatever gender they want
											if they weren&#39;t forced by society
into categories of either male or female
											the way South Africa used to force people
into categories of black or white.
											We know from anthropological science
that race is fiction,
											even though racism is very, very real,
											and we now know from cultural studies
											that separate male or female genders
is a constructed fiction.
											The reality is a gender fluidity
											that crosses the entire continuum

to stay at the hospital
											while the other watched
the rest of the kids,

people a year in the United States alone,

											who continue to die of this illness
											because the medicines
slow down the progression
											but they don&#39;t halt it.
											The only cure for pulmonary hypertension,
pulmonary fibrosis,
											cystic fibrosis, emphysema,
											COPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of,
											is a lung transplant,
											but sadly, there are only enough
available lungs for 2,000 people

million people a year

											and buildings going forever
											with an unlimited supply
of building parts and machine parts,
											why can&#39;t we create an unlimited supply
of transplantable organs
											to keep people living indefinitely,
											and especially people with lung disease.
											So we&#39;ve teamed up with the decoder
of the human genome, Craig Venter,
											and the company he founded
											with Peter Diamandis,
the founder of the X Prize,
											to genetically modify
											the pig genome
											so that the pig&#39;s organs will not
be rejected by the human body

											CA: And is your thinking here,
part of your hope here, is that
											this version of Bina can in a sense
live on forever, or some future upgrade
											to this version can live on forever?
											MR: Yes. Not just Bina, but everybody.
											You know, it costs us virtually nothing
to store our mind files
											on Facebook, Instagram, what-have-you.
											Social media is I think one of the most
extraordinary inventions of our time,
											and as apps become available
that will allow us
											to out-Siri Siri, better and better,
											and develop consciousness
operating systems,
											everybody in the world,
billions of people,
											will be able to develop
mind clones of themselves
											that will have their own life on the web.

											CA: So the thing is, Martine,

this would sound stark-staring mad,
											but in the context of your life,
what you&#39;ve done,
											some of the things we&#39;ve heard this week,
											the constructed realities
that our minds give,
											I mean, you wouldn&#39;t bet against it.

											MR: Well, I think it&#39;s really nothing
coming from me.
											If anything, I&#39;m perhaps a bit
of a communicator of activities
											that are being undertaken
by the greatest companies
											in China, Japan, India, the U.S., Europe.
											There are tens of millions of people
working on writing code
											that expresses more and more aspects
of our human consciousness,
											and you don&#39;t have to be a genius
to see that all these threads
											are going to come together
and ultimately create human consciousness,
											and it&#39;s something we&#39;ll value.
											There are so many things
to do in this life,
											and if we could have a simulacrum,
a digital doppelgänger of ourselves
											that helps us process books, do shopping,
											be our best friends,
											I believe our mind clones,
these digital versions of ourselves,
											will ultimately be our best friends,
											and for me personally and Bina personally,
											we love each other like crazy.
											Each day, we are always saying, like,
											&quot;Wow, I love you even more
than 30 years ago.
											And so for us, the prospect of mind clones
											and regenerated bodies
											is that our love affair, Chris,
can go on forever.
											And we never get bored of each other.
I&#39;m sure we never will.
