											I was four years old
											when Pearl Harbor was bombed
											on December 7, 1941 by Japan,
											and overnight, the world was plunged
											into a world war.
											America suddenly was swept up
											by hysteria.
											Japanese-Americans,
											American citizens of Japanese ancestry,
											were looked on
											with suspicion and fear
											and with outright hatred
											simply because we happened to look like
											the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.
											And the hysteria grew and grew
											until in February 1942,
											the president of the United States,
											Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
											ordered all Japanese-Americans
											on the West Coast of America
											to be summarily rounded up
											with no charges, with no trial,
											with no due process.
											Due process, this is a core pillar
											of our justice system.
											That all disappeared.
											We were to be rounded up
											and imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps
											in some of the most desolate places in America:
											the blistering hot desert of Arizona,
											the sultry swamps of Arkansas,
											the wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,
											and two of the most desolate places in California.

											On April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday,
											and just a few weeks after my birthday,
											my parents got my younger brother,
											my baby sister and me
											up very early one morning,
											and they dressed us hurriedly.
											My brother and I were in the living room
											looking out the front window,
											and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.
											They carried bayonets on their rifles.
											They stomped up the front porch
											and banged on the door.
											My father answered it,
											and the soldiers ordered us out of our home.
											My father gave my brother and me
											small luggages to carry,
											and we walked out and stood on the driveway
											waiting for our mother to come out,
											and when my mother finally came out,
											she had our baby sister in one arm,
											a huge duffel bag in the other,
											and tears were streaming down both her cheeks.
											I will never be able to forget that scene.
											It is burned into my memory.

											We were taken from our home
											and loaded on to train cars
											with other Japanese-American families.
											There were guards stationed
											at both ends of each car,
											as if we were criminals.
											We were taken two thirds of
the way across the country,
											rocking on that train for four days and three nights,
											to the swamps of Arkansas.
											I still remember the barbed wire fence
											that confined me.
											I remember the tall sentry tower
											with the machine guns pointed at us.
											I remember the searchlight that followed me
											when I made the night runs
											from my barrack to the latrine.
											But to five-year-old me,
											I thought it was kind of nice that they&#39;d lit the way

											It became normal for me to go with my father

											Being in a prison, a barbed-wire prison camp,

											When the war ended,
											we were released,
											and given a one-way ticket
											to anywhere in the United States.
											My parents decided to go back home
											to Los Angeles,
											but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place.
											We were penniless.
											Everything had been taken from us,
											and the hostility was intense.
											Our first home was on Skid Row
											in the lowest part of our city,
											living with derelicts, drunkards
											and crazy people,
											the stench of urine all over,
											on the street, in the alley,
											in the hallway.
											It was a horrible experience,
											and for us kids, it was terrorizing.
											I remember once
											a drunkard came staggering down,
											fell down right in front of us,
											and threw up.
											My baby sister said, &quot;Mama, let&#39;s go back home,&quot;
											because behind barbed wires
											was for us
											home.

											My parents worked hard
											to get back on their feet.
											We had lost everything.
											They were at the middle of their lives
											and starting all over.
											They worked their fingers to the bone,
											and ultimately they were able
											to get the capital together to buy
											a three-bedroom home in a nice neighborhood.
											And I was a teenager,
											and I became very curious
											about my childhood imprisonment.
											I had read civics books that told me about
											the ideals of American democracy.
											All men are created equal,
											we have an inalienable right
											to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
											and I couldn&#39;t quite make that fit
											with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment.
											I read history books,
											and I couldn&#39;t find anything about it.
											And so I engaged my father after dinner
											in long, sometimes heated conversations.
											We had many, many conversations like that,
											and what I got from them
											was my father&#39;s wisdom.
											He was the one that suffered the most
											under those conditions of imprisonment,
											and yet he understood American democracy.
											He told me that our democracy
											is a people&#39;s democracy,
											and it can be as great as the people can be,
											but it is also as fallible as people are.
											He told me that American democracy
											is vitally dependent on good people
											who cherish the ideals of our system
											and actively engage in the process
											of making our democracy work.
											And he took me to a campaign headquarters —
											the governor of Illinois was
running for the presidency —
											and introduced me to American electoral politics.
											And he also told me about
											young Japanese-Americans
											during the Second World War.

											When Pearl Harbor was bombed,
											young Japanese-Americans,
like all young Americans,
											rushed to their draft board
											to volunteer to fight for our country.
											That act of patriotism
											was answered with a slap in the face.
											We were denied service,
											and categorized as enemy non-alien.
											It was outrageous to be called an enemy
											when you&#39;re volunteering to fight for your country,
											but that was compounded with the word &quot;non-alien,&quot;
											which is a word that means
											&quot;citizen&quot; in the negative.
											They even took the word &quot;citizen&quot; away from us,
											and imprisoned them for a whole year.

											And then the government realized
											that there&#39;s a wartime manpower shortage,
											and as suddenly as they&#39;d rounded us up,
											they opened up the military for service
											by young Japanese-Americans.
											It was totally irrational,
											but the amazing thing,
											the astounding thing,
											is that thousands of young
											Japanese-American men and women
											again went from behind those barbed-wire fences,
											put on the same uniform as that of our guards,
											leaving their families in imprisonment,
											to fight for this country.

											There is one battle that illustrates that.
											It was a battle for the Gothic Line.
											The Germans were embedded
											in this mountain hillside,
											rocky hillside,
											in impregnable caves,
											and three allied battalions
											had been pounding away at it
											for six months,
											and they were stalemated.
											The 442nd was called in
											to add to the fight,
											but the men of the 442nd
											came up with a unique
											but dangerous idea:
											The backside of the mountain
											was a sheer rock cliff.
											The Germans thought an attack from the backside
											would be impossible.
											The men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible.
											On a dark, moonless night,
											they began scaling that rock wall,
											a drop of more than 1,000 feet,
											in full combat gear.
											They climbed all night long
											on that sheer cliff.
											In the darkness,
											some lost their handhold
											or their footing
											and they fell to their deaths
											in the ravine below.
											They all fell silently.
											Not a single one cried out,
											so as not to give their position away.
											The men climbed for eight hours straight,
											and those who made it to the top
											stayed there until the first break of light,
											and as soon as light broke,
											they attacked.
											The Germans were surprised,
											and they took the hill
											and broke the Gothic Line.
											A six-month stalemate
											was broken by the 442nd
											in 32 minutes.

											They are my heroes.
											They clung to their belief

											and they proved that being an American
											is not just for some people,
