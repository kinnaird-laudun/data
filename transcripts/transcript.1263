									<p>
											I worked on a film called &quot;Apollo 13,&quot;
											and when I worked on this film, I discovered something
											about how our brains work, and how our brains work
											is that, when we&#39;re sort of infused with
											either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,
											it changes and alters our perception of things.
											It changes what we see. It changes what we remember.
											And as an experiment, because I dauntingly create
											a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch
											for this particular movie, because I put it out there,
											I felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experiment
											and bring a group of people like this in a projection room
											and play this stock footage, and when I played this
											stock footage, I simply wanted to find out
											what people remembered, what was memorable about it?
											What should I actually try to replicate?
											What should I try to emulate to some degree?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So this is the footage that I was showing everybody.
											And what I discovered is, because of the nature
											of the footage and the fact that we&#39;re doing this film,
											there was an emotion that was built into it
											and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us
											and all these various things.
											When I showed it, and I asked, immediately after
											the screening was over, what they thought of it,
											what was your memorable shots, they changed them.
											They were — had camera moves on them.
											They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined,
											and I was just really curious, I mean, what the hell
											were you looking at just a few minutes ago
											and how come, how&#39;d you come up with this sort of description?
											And what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually
											replicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So this is our footage of the launch, based on, basically,
											taking notes, asking people what they thought, and then
											the combination of all the different shots and all
											the different things put together created their sort of
											collective consciousness of what they remembered
											it looked like, but not what it really looked like.
											So this is what we created for &quot;Apollo 13.&quot;
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So literally what you&#39;re seeing now is the confluence
											of a bunch of different people, a bunch of different memories,
											including my own, of taking a little bit of liberty
											with the subject matter.
											I basically shot everything with short lenses,
											which means that you&#39;re very close to the action,
											but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots
											which gives you a sense of distance, so I was basically
											was setting up something that would remind you
											of something you haven&#39;t really quite seen before. (Music)
											And then I&#39;m going to show you exactly what it is
											that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.

											So now I&#39;m in a parking lot. Basically it&#39;s a tin can,
											and I&#39;m basically recreating the launch with
											fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw
											in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically
											if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you,

											I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically

											So here&#39;s the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.
											So, when you saw my footage,
											you were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guys
											flipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subs
											are actually about the size of small footballs,
											and shot in smoke.
											Jim went three miles went down, and I went about

											And so, but what you&#39;re emoting to, or what you&#39;re looking
											at, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality,
											that Jim&#39;s footage had, so I found it so fascinating
											that our brains sort of, once you believe something&#39;s real,
											you transfer everything that you feel about it,
											this quality you have, and it&#39;s totally artificial.
											It&#39;s totally make-believe, yet it&#39;s not to you,
											and I found that that was a very interesting thing
											to explore and use, and it caused me to create the next
											effect that I&#39;ll show you, which is
											this sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting
											to do is basically have the audience cue the effect,
											so it became a seamless experience for them,
											that I wasn&#39;t showing you my sort of interpretation,
											I was showing you what you wanted to see.
											And the very next shot, right after this —

											and I don&#39;t remember if I did this or Jim did this.

											RL: So, what I did is basically I had another

											of the ship, and then at some point,

											The next illustration is something that, there&#39;s like
											all one shot theory. It&#39;s a very elegant way of telling a story,
											especially if you&#39;re following somebody on a journey,
											and that journey basically tells something about
											their personality in a very concise way,
											and what we wanted to do based on the shot in &quot;Goodfellas,&quot;
											which is one of the great shots ever,
											a Martin Scorsese film, of basically following Henry Hill
											through what it feels like to be a gangster walk
											going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way.
											He was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugo
											to feel the same way, so we created this shot.

									<p>
											(Music)
											That&#39;s Hugo. (Music)
											And we felt that if we could basically move the camera
											with him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy
											who is basically the master of his universe,
											and his universe is, you know, behind the scenes
											in the bowels of this particular train station
											that only he can actually navigate through
											and do it this way, and we had to make it feel that
											this is his normal, everyday sort of life,
											so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important,
											and of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically
											it&#39;s a huge camera that&#39;s hanging off of a giant stick,
											so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task,
											and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got
											when you saw the &quot;Goodfellas&quot; shot.

											So what you&#39;re now going to see is how we actually did it.
											It&#39;s actually five separate sets shot at five different times
											with two different boys.
											The one on the left is where the shot ends,
											and the shot on the right is where it takes over,
											and now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield,
											who&#39;s the star of the show, to his stand-in. (Music)
											I wouldn&#39;t say his stunt double. There&#39;s a crazy rig
											that we built for this. (Music)
											And so this is, and now this is set number three
											we&#39;re into, and then we&#39;re going to go into, basically
											the very last moment of the shot is actually
											the steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes
											and various things like that, and it literally was done
											over five different sets, two different boys, different times,
											and it all had to feel like it was all one shot, and what was
											sort of great for me was it was probably
											the best-reviewed shot I&#39;ve ever worked on,
											and, you know, I was kind of proud of it when I was done,
											which is, you should never really be proud of stuff, I guess.

											So I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine,

His 2012 Oscar win for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/3joT\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hugo</em></a>, the 3D film about a boy who lives alone in a Paris train station, underscores his fascinating partnership with Martin Scorsese -- doing digital effects on documentaries and new classics like&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/3b1f\" target=\"_blank\">The Departed</a>.</em></p>  <p>He&#39;s worked with the big effects houses like Sony Imageworks and Digital Domain, but is now fascinated with the nimble new workflows made possible with digital tools. He designed the &quot;virtual cinematography pipeline&quot; that let James Cameron shoot <em>Avatar</em> like a feature film, not a software project.
