											Dre Urhahn: This theater 
is built on Copacabana,
											which is the most famous 
beach in the world,
											but 25 kilometers away from here
											in the North Zone of Rio
											lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro,
											and roughly 60,000 people live there.
											Now, the people here in Rio mostly know
											Vila Cruzeiro from the news,
											and unfortunately, news 
from Vila Cruzeiro often
											is not good news.
											But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place
											where our story begins.

											Jeroen Koolhaas: Ten years 
ago, we first came to Rio
											to shoot a documentary 
about life in the favelas.
											Now, we learned that favelas 
are informal communities.
											They emerged over the years
											when immigrants from the countryside
											came to the cities looking for work,
											like cities within the cities,
											known for problems like crime, poverty,
											and the violent drug war between
											police and the drug gangs.
											So what struck us was that
											these were communities that the people
											who lived there had built 
with their own hands,
											without a master plan
											and like a giant work in progress.
											Where we&#39;re from, in Holland,
											everything is planned.
											We even have rules for 
how to follow the rules.

											DU: So the last day of 
filming, we ended up
											in Vila Cruzeiro, and 
we were sitting down
											and we had a drink,
											and we were overlooking this hill
											with all these houses,
											and most of these houses looked unfinished,
											and they had walls of bare brick,
											but we saw some of these houses
											which were plastered and painted,
											and suddenly we had this idea:
											what would it look like if all these houses
											would be plastered and painted?
											And then we imagined one big design,
											one big work of art.
											Who would expect something like that
											in a place like this?
											So we thought, would that even be possible?
											So first we started to count the houses,
											but we soon lost count.
											But somehow the idea stuck.

									<p>
											JK: We had a friend.
											He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.
											His name was Nanko,
											and he also liked the idea.
											He said, &quot;You know, everybody here
											would pretty much love 
to have their houses
											plastered and painted.
											It&#39;s when a house is finished.&quot;
											So he introduced us to the right people,
											and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew.
											We picked three houses in
the center of the community
											and we start here. We made a few designs,
											and everybody liked this design
											of a boy flying a kite the best.
											So we started painting, 
and the first thing we did
											was to paint everything blue,
											and we thought that looked 
already pretty good.
											But they hated it. The people
who lived there really hated it.
											They said, &quot;What did you do?
											You painted our house in 
exactly the same color
											as the police station.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											In a favela, that is not a good thing.
											Also the same color as the prison cell.
											So we quickly went ahead 
and we painted the boy,
											and then we thought we were finished,
											we were really happy, but still,
											it wasn&#39;t good because the little
kids started coming up to us,
											and they said, &quot;You know, 
there&#39;s a boy flying the kite,
											but where is his kite?&quot;
											We said, &quot;Uh, it&#39;s art.
											You know, you have to imagine the kite.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And they said, &quot;No, no, no, 
we want to see the kite.&quot;
											So we quickly installed a kite
											way up high on the hill,
											so that you could see 
the boy flying the kite
											and you could actually see a kite.
											So the local news started writing about it,
											which was great,
											and then even The Guardian wrote about it:
											&quot;Notorious slum becomes open-air gallery.&quot;

											JK: So, encouraged by this success,
											we went back to Rio for a second project,
											and we stumbled upon this street.
											It was covered in concrete 
to prevent mudslides,
											and somehow we saw a sort of river in it,
											and we imagined this river
to be a river in Japanese style
											with koi carp swimming upstream.
											So we decided to paint that river,
											and we invited Rob Admiraal,
											who is a tattoo artist,
											and he specialized in the Japanese style.
											So little did we know that we would spend
											almost an entire year painting that river,
											together with Geovani
and Robinho and Vitor,
											who lived nearby.
											And we even moved into the neighborhood
											when one of the guys that 
lived on the street, Elias,
											told us that we could come 
and live in his house,
											together with his family,
											which was fantastic.
											Unfortunately, during that time,
											another war broke out between the police
											and the drug gangs.
											(Video) (Gunfire)
											We learned that during those times,
											people in communities 
really stick together
											during these times of hardship,
											but we also learned a 
very important element,
											the importance of barbecues. 
(Laughter)
											Because, when you throw a barbecue,
											it turns you from a guest into a host,
											so we decided to throw one
											almost every other week,
											and we got to know everybody 
in the neighborhood.

											DU: Yeah, yeah, we were talking about
											the scale of this, because this painting
											was incredibly big,
											and it was insanely detailed,
											and this process almost drove
us completely insane ourselves.
											But we figured that maybe, 
during this process,
											all the time that we had 
spent in the neighborhood
											was maybe actually even more important
											than the painting itself.

									<p>
											JK: So after all that time,
											this hill, this idea was still there,
											and we started to make sketches,
											models, and we figured something out.
											We figured that our ideas, our designs
											had to be a little bit more simple than that last project
											so that we could paint with more people
											and cover more houses at the same time.
											And we had an opportunity to try that out
											in a community in the central part of Rio,
											which is called Santa Marta,
											and we made a design for this place
											which looked like this,
											and then we got people to go along with it
											because turns out that if 
your idea is ridiculously big,
											it&#39;s easier to get people to 
go along with this. (Laughter)
											And the people of Santa Marta
											got together and in a little over a month
											they turned that square into this.
											(Applause)
											And this image somehow 
went all over the world.

									<p>
											DU: So then we received 
an unexpected phone call
											from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program,
											and they had this question
											if this idea, our approach,
											if this would actually 
work in North Philly,
											which is one of the poorest neighborhoods
											in the United States.
											So we immediately said yes.
											We had no idea how,
											but it seemed like a very 
interesting challenge,
											so we did exactly the 
same as we did in Rio,
											and we moved into the neighborhood
											and started barbecuing.
											(Laughter)
											So the project took almost two years to complete,
											and we made individual designs
											for every single house on 
the avenue that we painted,
											and we made these designs together
											with the local store owners, 
the building owners,
											and a team of about a dozen 
young men and women.
											They were hired, and then
they were trained as painters,
											and together they transformed
their own neighborhood,
											the whole street, into a 
giant patchwork of color.
											(Applause)
											And at the end, the city of Philadelphia
											thanked every single one of them
											and gave them a merit for
their accomplishment.

									<p>
											JK: So now we had painted a whole street.
											How about we do this whole hill now?
											We started looking for funding,
											but instead, we just ran into questions,
											like, how many houses 
are you going to paint?
											How many square meters is that?
											How much paint are you going to use,
											and how many people are you going to employ?
											And we did try for years to write plans
											for the funding and answer 
all those questions,
											but then we thought,
											in order to answer all those questions,
											you have to know exactly 
what you&#39;re going to do
											before you actually get there and start.
											And maybe it&#39;s a mistake 
to think like that.
											It would lose some of the 
magic that we had learned
											about that if you go somewhere
											and you spend time there,
											you can let the project grow organically
											and have a life of its own.

									<p>
											DU: So what we did is
											we decided to take this 
plan and strip it away
											from all the numbers
											and all the ideas and presumptions
											and just go back to the base idea,
											which was to transform this hill
											into a giant work of art.
											And instead of looking for funding,
											we started a crowdfunding campaign,
											and in a little over a month,
											more than 1,500 people put together
											and donated over 100,000 dollars.
											So for us, this was an amazing 
moment, because now —
											(Applause) —
											because now we finally had the freedom
											to use all the lessons that we had learned
											and create a project that was built
											the same way that the favela was built,
											from the ground on up, bottom up,
											with no master plan.

											JK: So we went back, 
and we employed Angelo,
											and he&#39;s a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro,
											very talented guy, and he
knows almost everybody there,
											and then we employed Elias, our former landlord
											who invited us into his house,
											and he&#39;s a master of construction.
											Together with them, we decided where to start.
											We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro,
											and houses are being plastered as we speak.
											And the good thing about them is that
											they are deciding which houses go next.
											They&#39;re even printing t-shirts,
											they&#39;re putting up banners
											explaining everything to everybody,

											JK: So the favela was not only the place
											where this idea started:
											it was also the place that made it possible
											to work without a master plan,
											because these communities are informal —
											this was the inspiration —
											and in a communal effort,

Spurred on in 2010 by Dutch artists Jeroen Koolhaas and Dre Urhahn in collaboration with the local group &quot;Tudo de cor para voc&ecirc;&quot;, the painting was accomplished by 25 young people from the neighborhood, and reframed the square as a place of shared pride. The locals have since continued the project, with monthly painting task forces and other activities that have involved 800 people and transformed the aesthetic and the social psychology of the whole favela.<br />&nbsp;<br />Known as &quot;favela painters&quot;, Haas&amp;Hahn have been working on community projects in Rio for almost 10 years. They&#39;ve also worked in Haiti and Cura&ccedil;ao, and in 2011, they moved north into a tough neighborhood in northern Philadelphia, where they trained the Philly Painting crew to cover a worn-out commercial corridor in massive color blocks. They&#39;ve returned to Rio in 2014 for a new project in the Vila Cruzeiro favela."}],"speaker_name":"Haas&Hahn","tags":["art","cities","community"],"title":"How painting can transform communities","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1732738}]}
