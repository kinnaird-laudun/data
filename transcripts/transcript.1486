											Diana Reiss: You may think you&#39;re looking
											through a window at a dolphin
spinning playfully,
											but what you&#39;re actually looking through
											is a two-way mirror at a dolphin
											looking at itself spinning playfully.
											This is a dolphin that is self-aware.
											This dolphin has self-awareness.
											It&#39;s a young dolphin named Bayley.
											I&#39;ve been very interested
in understanding the nature
											of the intelligence of dolphins
for the past 30 years.
											How do we explore
intelligence in this animal
											that&#39;s so different from us?
											And what I&#39;ve used is a very
simple research tool,
											a mirror, and we&#39;ve gained
great information,
											reflections of these animal minds.
											Dolphins aren&#39;t the only animals,
the only non-human animals,
											to show mirror self-recognition.
											We used to think this
was a uniquely human ability,
											but we learned that the great
apes, our closest relatives,
											also show this ability.
											Then we showed it in dolphins,
											and then later in elephants.
											We did this work in my lab
with the dolphins and elephants,
											and it&#39;s been recently
shown in the magpie.

									<p>
											Now, it&#39;s interesting,
because we&#39;ve embraced
											this Darwinian view of a continuity
in physical evolution,
											this physical continuity.
											But we&#39;ve been much more
reticent, much slower
											at recognizing this
continuity in cognition,
											in emotion, in consciousness
in other animals.

									<p>
											Other animals are conscious.
											They&#39;re emotional. They&#39;re aware.
											There have been multitudes
of studies with many species
											over the years that have
given us exquisite evidence
											for thinking and consciousness
in other animals,
											other animals that are quite
different than we are in form.
											We are not alone.
											We are not alone in these abilities.
											And I hope, and one of my biggest dreams,
											is that, with our growing awareness
											about the consciousness of others
											and our relationship with the rest
of the animal world,
											that we&#39;ll give them
the respect and protection
											that they deserve.
											So that&#39;s a wish I&#39;m throwing
out here for everybody,
											and I hope I can really
engage you in this idea.

											Now, I want to return to dolphins,
											because these are the animals
that I feel like
											I&#39;ve been working up closely
and personal with
											for over 30 years.
											And these are real personalities.
											They are not persons,
but they&#39;re personalities
											in every sense of the word.
											And you can&#39;t get more
alien than the dolphin.
											They are very different
from us in body form.
											They&#39;re radically different. They come
from a radically different environment.
											In fact, we&#39;re separated
by 95 million years
											of divergent evolution.
											Look at this body.
											And in every sense of making a pun here,
											these are true non-terrestrials.

									<p>
											I wondered how we might
interface with these animals.
											In the 1980s, I developed
an underwater keyboard.
											This was a custom-made
touch-screen keyboard.
											What I wanted to do was give
the dolphins choice and control.
											These are big brains,
highly social animals,
											and I thought, well, if we give
them choice and control,
											if they can hit a symbol
on this keyboard —
											and by the way, it was interfaced
by fiber optic cables
											from Hewlett-Packard
with an Apple II computer.
											This seems prehistoric now,
											but this was where
we were with technology.
											So the dolphins could hit a key, a symbol,
											they heard a computer-generated whistle,
											and they got an object or activity.

											Now here&#39;s a little video.
											This is Delphi and Pan,
and you&#39;re going to see Delphi

whistle — (Whistle) —
											and gets a ball, so they can

											What was remarkable is,
they explored this keyboard
											on their own. There was no
intervention on our part.
											They explored the keyboard.
They played around with it.
											They figured out how it worked.
											And they started to quickly
imitate the sounds
											they were hearing on the keyboard.
											They imitated on their own.

											Beyond that, though, they started learning

between the symbols, the sounds

											What we saw was self-organized learning,

											Peter Gabriel: I make noises for a living.
											On a good day, it&#39;s music,
											and I want to talk a little bit about
											the most amazing music-making
experience I ever had.
											I&#39;m a farm boy. I grew
up surrounded by animals,
											and I would look in these eyes and wonder
											what was going on there?
											So as an adult, when
I started to read about
											the amazing breakthroughs
with Penny Patterson and Koko,
											with Sue Savage-Rumbaugh
and Kanzi, Panbanisha,
											Irene Pepperberg, Alex the parrot,
											I got all excited.
											What was amazing to me also
											was they seemed a lot more adept
											at getting a handle on our language
											than we were on getting
a handle on theirs.
											I work with a lot of musicians
from around the world,
											and often we don&#39;t have
any common language at all,
											but we sit down behind our instruments,
											and suddenly there&#39;s a way
for us to connect and emote.

											So I started cold-calling,
and eventually got through
											to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh,

											I went down, and the bonobos
											had had access to percussion instruments,
											musical toys, but never
before to a keyboard.
											At first they did what infants do,
											just bashed it with their fists,
											and then I asked, through Sue,
											if Panbanisha could try
with one finger only.

											The idea is this will be — much
like the Internet functions
											as a network of networks,
											which is Vint&#39;s core contribution,
											this will be a wrapper
around all of these initiatives,
											that are wonderful individually,
to link them globally.
