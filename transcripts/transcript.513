											Do we live in a borderless world?
											Before you answer that, have a look at this map.
											Contemporary political map shows
											that we have over 200 countries in the world today.
											That&#39;s probably more than at any time in centuries.
											Now, many of you will object.
											For you this would be a more appropriate map.
											You could call it TEDistan.
											In TEDistan, there are no borders,
											just connected spaces and unconnected spaces.
											Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots
											on this screen, of the many more
											that represent 90 percent of the world economy.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But let&#39;s talk about the 90 percent of the world population
											that will never leave the place in which they were born.
											For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,
											and often violently.
											Now here at TED, we&#39;re solving some of the great
											riddles of science and mysteries of the universe.
											Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:
											our basic political geography.
											How do we distribute ourselves around the world?

									<p>
											Now this is important, because border conflicts
											justify so much of the world&#39;s military-industrial complex.
											Border conflicts can derail
											so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.
											So I think we need a deeper understanding
											of how people, money, power,
											religion, culture, technology
											interact to change the map of the world.
											And we can try to anticipate those changes,
											and shape them in a more constructive direction.

											So we&#39;re going to look at some maps of the past,
											the present and some maps you haven&#39;t seen
											in order to get a sense of where things are going.
											Let&#39;s start with the world of 1945.
											1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.
											After World War II, Europe was devastated,
											but still held large overseas colonies:
											French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.
											Then over the late &#39;40s,
											&#39;50s, &#39;60s, &#39;70s and &#39;80s,
											waves of decolonization took place.
											Over 50 new countries were born.
											You can see that Africa has been fragmented.
											India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created.
											Then came the end of the Cold War.
											The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
											You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe,
											the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans,
											and the &#39;stans of central Asia.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Today we have 200 countries in the world.
											The entire planet is covered
											by sovereign, independent nation-states.
											Does that mean that someone&#39;s gain has to be someone else&#39;s loss?
											Let&#39;s zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world,
											Eastern Eurasia.
											As you can see on this map,
											Russia is still the largest country in the world.
											And as you know, China is the most populous.
											And they share a lengthy land border.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What you don&#39;t see on this map
											is that most of Russia&#39;s 150 million people
											are concentrated in its western provinces
											and areas that are close to Europe.
											And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas.
											In fact, the World Bank predicts
											that Russia&#39;s population is declining
											towards about 120 million people
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And there is another thing that you don&#39;t see on this map.
											Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders
											forced Russians out to the far east
											to be in gulags, labor camps,
											nuclear cities, whatever the case was.
											But as oil prices rose,
											Russian governments have invested in infrastructure
											to unite the country, east and west.
											But nothing has more perversely impacted
											Russia&#39;s demographic distribution,
											because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,
											have gotten on those trains and roads
											and gone back to the west.
											As a result, in the Russian far east today,
											which is twice the size of India,
											you have exactly six million Russians.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let&#39;s get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.
											We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.
											Why do they call it that?
											Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate
											and own most of the mines — copper, zinc, gold —
											and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.
											China isn&#39;t conquering Mongolia.
											It&#39;s buying it.

											So let&#39;s apply this principle to Siberia.

											This is just to give you a taste of what&#39;s happening in this part of the world.
											Again, globalization Chinese style.
											Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to
											undermine and change the way we think about political geography.
											So, the history of East Asia in fact,
											people don&#39;t think about nations and borders.
											They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,

									<p>
											Well it&#39;s China&#39;s turn again.
											So let&#39;s look at how China is re-establishing
											that hierarchy in the far East.
											It starts with the global hubs.
											Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map
											that show the hubs of the global economy?
											East Asia today has more of those global hubs
											than any other region in the world.
											Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,
											Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.
											These are the filters and funnels of global capital.
											Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,
											so much of it being invested into China.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Then there is trade.
											These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger
											trade relationships that China has
											with every country in the region.
											Specifically, it targets Japan
											and Korea and Australia,
											countries that are strong allies of the United States.
											Australia, for example, is heavily dependent
											on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.
											For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs
											so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply
											and become dependent on exporting to China as well.

											And now many of you have been reading in the news
											how people are looking to China
											to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.
											The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that&#39;s emerging
											now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.
											So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.
											China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.
											It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions
											such as the East Asian Community.
											Some of these organizations don&#39;t even have
											the United States as a member.
											There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,
											such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,
											most countries vow to just sit it out,
											including American allies like Korea and Australia.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Another pillar of the strategy,
											like Russia, is demographic.
											China exports business people, nannies, students,
											teachers to teach Chinese around the region,
											to intermarry and to occupy ever greater
											commanding heights of the economies.
											Already ethnic Chinese people
											in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia
											are the real key factors and drivers
											in the economies there.
											Chinese pride is resurgent in the region
											as a result.
											Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.
											Now it encourages it.

											If you add it all up what do you get?
											Well, if you remember before World War II,
											Japan had a vision
											for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.
											What&#39;s emerging today is what you might call
											a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.
											So no matter what the lines on the map tell you
											in terms of nations and borders,

											Let&#39;s start with Iraq.
											Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,
											the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.
											Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;
											now it is the most significant cause of the country&#39;s disintegration.
											The reason is Kurdistan.
											The Kurds for 3,000 years
											have been waging a struggle for independence,
											and now is their chance to finally have it.
											These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,
											which is an oil-rich region.

											And today, if you go to Kurdistan,
											you&#39;ll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas
											are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.
											But what are they guarding?
											Is it really a border on the map?
											No. It&#39;s the pipelines.
											If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms
											of their own statehood.
											Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?
											I don&#39;t believe we should.
											Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,
											behind Saudi Arabia.
											And we&#39;ll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.
											Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.
											It has no choice but to behave.
											In order to profit from its oil
											it has to export it through Turkey or Syria,
											and other countries, and Iraq itself.
											And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.

											Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.
											That is, of course, in Palestine.
											Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly
											because it&#39;s two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.
											30 years of rose garden diplomacy
											have not delivered us peace in this conflict.
											What might? I believe that what might
											solve the problem is infrastructure.

											Now what might this entire region look like
											if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,
											when the insecurities might abate?
											The last time that was the case was actually
											a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.
											This is the Hejaz Railway.
											The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.
											It even had an offshoot running to Haifa
											in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.
											But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.
											If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,
											infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,

											These countries&#39; borders originate from Stalin&#39;s decrees.

											Before it was, how do we control their oil?
											Now it&#39;s their oil for their own purposes.
											And I assure you it&#39;s every bit as important to them
											as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.

											More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.
											The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.
											Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust.

											Now let&#39;s look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,

											And that is, of course, Europe.
											The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,
											and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany
											to happen in a peaceful way.
											But then eventually it grew into 12 countries,
											and those are the 12 stars on the European flag.
											The E.U. also became a currency block,
											and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.
											On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year
											since the end of the Cold War.
											In fact most of that happened on just one day.
											In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.

											So what is next? What is the future of the European Union?
											Well in light blue, you see the zones
											or the regions that are at least two-thirds
											or more dependent on the European Union
											for trade and investment.
											What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us
											that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.
											Even if these regions aren&#39;t part of the E.U.,
											they are becoming part of its sphere of influence.
											Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia
											Bosnia, they&#39;re not members of the E.U. yet.
											But you can get on a German ICE train
											and make it almost to Albania.
											In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,

											So, looking at other parts of Europe&#39;s periphery, such as North Africa.
											On average, every year or two,
											a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,
											connecting North Africa to Europe.
											That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance
											on Russia for energy,
											but if you travel to North Africa today, you&#39;ll hear more and more people saying

											Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile
