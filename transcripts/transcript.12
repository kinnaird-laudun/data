											I&#39;m the luckiest guy in the world.
											I got to see the last case
of killer smallpox in the world.
											I was in India this past year,
											and I may have seen
the last cases of polio in the world.
											There&#39;s nothing that makes
you feel more —
											the blessing and the honor
of working in a program like that —
											than to know that something
that horrible no longer exists.
											So I&#39;m going to tell you —
											(Applause)
											so I&#39;m going to show you
some dirty pictures.
											They are difficult to watch,
but you should look at them with optimism,
											because the horror
of these pictures will be matched
											by the uplifting quality of knowing
that they no longer exist.

											But first, I&#39;m going to tell you
a little bit about my own journey.
											My background is not exactly
the conventional medical education
											that you might expect.
											When I was an intern in San Francisco,
											I heard about a group of Native Americans
who had taken over Alcatraz Island,
											and a Native American
who wanted to give birth on that island,
											and no other doctor wanted
to go and help her give birth.
											I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived
on the island for several weeks.
											She gave birth; I caught
the baby; I got off the island;
											I landed in San Francisco;
											and all the press wanted to talk to me,
											because my three weeks on the island
made me an expert in Indian affairs.
											(Laughter)

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I wound up on every television show.
											Someone saw me on television;
they called me up; and they asked me
											if I&#39;d like to be in a movie
and to play a young doctor
											for a bunch of rock and roll stars
who were traveling in a bus ride
											from San Francisco to England.
											And I said, yes, I would do that,
											so I became the doctor
in an absolutely awful movie
											called &quot;Medicine Ball Caravan.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											Now, you know from the &#39;60s,
											you&#39;re either on the bus
or you&#39;re off the bus; I was on the bus.
											My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.
											Our bus ride took us
from San Francisco to London,
											then we switched buses at the big pond.
											We then got on two more buses
											and we drove through Turkey
and Iran, Afghanistan,
											over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan,
like every other young doctor.
											This is us at the Khyber Pass,
and that&#39;s our bus.
											We had some difficulty getting
over the Khyber Pass.
											But we wound up in India.
											And then, like everyone else
in our generation,
											we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.

											This is just like a residency program,
											for those of you
that are in medical school.
											(Laughter)
											And we studied with a wise man,
a guru named Karoli Baba,
											who then told me to get rid of the dress,
											put on a three-piece suit,
											go join the United Nations as a diplomat
											and work for the World
Health Organization.
											And he made an outrageous prediction
that smallpox would be eradicated,
											and that this was God&#39;s gift to humanity,
											because of the hard work
of dedicated scientists.
											And that prediction came true.
											This little girl is Rahima Banu,
											and she was the last case
of killer smallpox in the world.
											And this document is the certificate
that the global commission signed,
											certifying the world to have eradicated
the first disease in history.

											Larry Brilliant: Smallpox
was the worst disease in history.
											It killed more people
than all the wars in history.
											In the last century,
it killed 500 million people.
											You&#39;re reading about Larry Page already.
											Somebody reads very fast.
											(Laughter)
											In the year that Larry Page
and Sergey Brin —
											with whom I have a certain affection
and a new affiliation —
											in the year in which they were born,
											two million people died of smallpox.
											We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.
											This is the most important slide
that I&#39;ve ever seen in public health,
											[Sovereigns killed by smallpox]
because it shows you
											to be the richest and the strongest,
											and to be kings and queens of the world,
											did not protect you

											Never can you doubt

											In 1967, the WHO embarked
on what was an outrageous program
											to eradicate a disease.
											In that year, there were 34 countries
affected with smallpox.
											By 1970, we were down to 18 countries.
											1974, we were down to five countries.
											But in that year,
smallpox exploded throughout India.
											And India was the place
where smallpox made its last stand.
											In 1974, India had
a population of 600 million.
											There are 21 linguistic states in India,
											which is like saying
21 different countries.
											There are 20 million people
on the road at any time,
											in buses and trains, walking;
500,000 villages, 120 million households,
											and none of them wanted to report
											if they had a case
of smallpox in their house,
											because they thought that smallpox
was the visitation of a deity,
											Shitala Mata, the cooling mother,
											and it was wrong to bring
strangers into your house
											when the deity was in the house.
											No incentive to report smallpox.

											It wasn&#39;t just India
that had smallpox deities;
											smallpox deities were

											So, how we eradicated smallpox was —
											mass vaccination wouldn&#39;t work.
											You could vaccinate everybody in India,
											but one year later there&#39;d be
21 million new babies,
											which was then the population of Canada.
											It wouldn&#39;t do just to vaccinate everyone.
											You had to find every single
case of smallpox in the world
											at the same time, and draw
a circle of immunity around it.
											And that&#39;s what we did.

											And in the process,
I learned something very important.
											Every time we did a house-to-house search,
											we had a spike in the number
of reports of smallpox.
											When we didn&#39;t search, we had
the illusion that there was no disease.
											When we did search, we had the illusion
that there was more disease.
											A surveillance system was necessary,

was early detection, early response.

											We have a joke.
											This is an epidemic curve,

to know what it is.
											But the joke is,
											an epidemiologist likes to arrive
at an epidemic right here
											and ride to glory on the downhill curve.
											(Laughter)
											But you don&#39;t get to do that usually.
											You usually arrive right about here.
											What we really want is to arrive
right here, so we can stop the epidemic.
											But you can&#39;t always do that.
											But there&#39;s an organization
that has been able to find a way
											to learn when the first cases occur,

											LB: Well, as Ron St. John —
											I hope you&#39;ll go and meet him
in the dinner afterwards and talk to him.
											When he started GPHIN —
											In 1997, there was an outbreak
of bird flu — H5N1.
											It was in Hong Kong.
											And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong
responded immediately,
											by slaughtering 1.5 million
chickens and birds,
											and they stopped
that outbreak in its tracks.
											Immediate detection, immediate response.
											Then a number of years went by,
											and there were a lot
of rumors about bird flu.
											Ron and his team in Ottawa
began to crawl the web —
											only crawling 20,000 different websites,
mostly periodicals —
											and they read about
and heard about a concern,
											of a lot of children who had high fever
and symptoms of bird flu.

											WHO took a little while taking action,
											because WHO will only receive
a report from a government,
											because it&#39;s the United Nations.
											But they were able to point
to WHO and let them know
											that there was this surprising
and unexplained cluster of illnesses
											that looked like bird flu.
											That turned out to be SARS.
											That&#39;s how the world found out about SARS.
											And because of that,
we were able to stop SARS.
											Now, what&#39;s really important is that,
before there was GPHIN,
											100 percent of all the world&#39;s
reports of bad things —
											whether you&#39;re talking about famine
											or you&#39;re talking about bird flu
or you&#39;re talking about Ebola —
											100 percent of all those reports
came from nations.

											The moment these guys in Ottawa —
											on a budget of 800,000 dollars
a year — got cracking,
											75 percent of all the reports
in the world came from GPHIN,
											25 percent of all the reports in the world
											came from all the other 180 nations.
											Now, here&#39;s what&#39;s really interesting:
											after they&#39;d been working
for a couple years,
											what do you think happened
to those nations?
											They felt pretty stupid.
											So they started sending in
their reports early.
											And now, their reporting percentage
is down to 50 percent,
											because other nations
have started to report.
											So, can you find diseases
early by crawling the web?
											Of course you can.
											Can you find it even earlier
than GPHIN does now?
											Of course you can.
											You saw that they found SARS
using their Chinese web crawler
											a full six weeks before they found it
using their English web crawler.
											Well, they&#39;re only crawling
in seven languages.
											These bad viruses really
don&#39;t have any intention
											of showing up first in English
or Spanish or French.

											So yes, I want to take GPHIN,
I want to build on it.
											I want to add all the languages
of the world that we possibly can.
											I want to make this open to everybody,
											so that the health officer
in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar
											will have as much access to it
as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.
											And I want to make it part of our culture
											that there is a community of people
who are watching out
											for the worst nightmares of humanity,
											and that it&#39;s accessible to everyone.

Now, as Chair of the Skoll Global Threats Fund, he's redefining how we solve the world's biggest problems.","whylisten":"<p>Larry Brilliant&#39;s career path, as unlikely as it is inspirational, has proven worthy of his surname. Trained as a doctor, he was living in a Himalayan monastery in the early 1970s when his guru told him he should help rid the world of smallpox. He joined the World Health Organization&#39;s eradication project, directed efforts to eliminate the disease in India and eventually presided over the last case of smallpox on the planet.  </p><p>Not content with beating a single disease, he founded the nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.seva.org\" target=\"_blank\">Seva Foundation</a>, which has cured more than two million people of blindness in 15 countries through innovative surgery, self-sufficient eye care systems and low-cost manufacturing of intraocular lenses. Outside the medical field, he found time to cofound the legendary online community The Well, and run two public tech companies. <em>Time</em> and <em>WIRED</em> magazines call him a &quot;technology visionary.&quot; </p><p> His 2006 <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/pages/prizewinner_larry_brilliant\">TED Prize wish</a>  drew on both sides of his career: He challenged the TED community to help him build a global early-response system to spot new diseases&nbsp;as quickly as they emerge. Called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://instedd.org/\" target=\"_blank\">InSTEDD</a>, the system has grown into a network of 100 digital detection partners, which provide tools that help the UN, WHO and CDC track potential pandemics.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after he won the TED Prize, Google executives asked Brilliant to run their new philanthropic arm, <a href=\"http://Google.org\" target=\"_blank\">Google.org</a>. So, between consulting on the WHO&#39;s polio eradication project and designing a disease-surveillance network, he harnessed Google&#39;s brains and billions in a mix of for-profit and nonprofit ventures tackling the global problems of disease, poverty and climate change. Today, Brilliant is Chair of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.skollglobalthreats.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Skoll Global Threats Fund</a>, where he heads a team whose mission is to confront global threats imperiling humanity:  pandemics, climate change, water security, nuclear proliferation and Middle East

Prize winner Larry Brilliant has spent his career solving the ills of today -- from overseeing the last smallpox cases to saving millions from blindness -- and building technologies of the future. Now, as Chair of the Skoll Global Threats Fund, he's redefining how we solve the world's biggest problems.","whylisten":"<p>Larry Brilliant&#39;s career path, as unlikely as it is inspirational, has proven worthy of his surname. Trained as a doctor, he was living in a Himalayan monastery in the early 1970s when his guru told him he should help rid the world of smallpox. He joined the World Health Organization&#39;s eradication project, directed efforts to eliminate the disease in India and eventually presided over the last case of smallpox on the planet.  </p><p>Not content with beating a single disease, he founded the nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.seva.org\" target=\"_blank\">Seva Foundation</a>, which has cured more than two million people of blindness in 15 countries through innovative surgery, self-sufficient eye care systems and low-cost manufacturing of intraocular lenses. Outside the medical field, he found time to cofound the legendary online community The Well, and run two public tech companies. <em>Time</em> and <em>WIRED</em> magazines call him a &quot;technology visionary.&quot; </p><p> His 2006 <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/pages/prizewinner_larry_brilliant\">TED Prize wish</a>  drew on both sides of his career: He challenged the TED community to help him build a global early-response system to spot new diseases&nbsp;as quickly as they emerge. Called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://instedd.org/\" target=\"_blank\">InSTEDD</a>, the system has grown into a network of 100 digital detection partners, which provide tools that help the UN, WHO and CDC track potential pandemics.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after he won the TED Prize, Google executives asked Brilliant to run their new philanthropic arm, <a href=\"http://Google.org\" target=\"_blank\">Google.org</a>. So, between consulting on the WHO&#39;s polio eradication project and designing a disease-surveillance network, he harnessed Google&#39;s brains and billions in a mix of for-profit and nonprofit ventures tackling the global problems of disease, poverty and climate change. Today, Brilliant is Chair of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.skollglobalthreats.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Skoll Global Threats Fund</a>, where he heads a team whose mission is to confront global threats imperiling humanity:  pandemics, climate change, water security, nuclear proliferation and Middle East conflict.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Larry Brilliant","tags":["TED Prize","collaboration","disease","ebola","global issues","health","science","technology"],"title":"My wish: Help me stop pandemics","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":746018}]}
