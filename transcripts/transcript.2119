<title>Parag Khanna: How megacities are changing the map of the world | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: &quot;I want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth,&quot; says global strategist Parag Khanna. As our expanding cities grow ever more connected through transportation, energy and communications networks, we evolve from geography to what he calls &quot;connectography.&quot; This emerging global network civilization holds the promise of reducing pollution and inequality -- and even overcoming geopolitical rivalries. In this talk, Khanna asks us to embrace a new maxim for the future: &quot;Connectivity is destiny.&quot;" />

<meta content='"I want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth," says global strategist Parag Khanna. As our expanding cities grow ever more connected through transportation, energy and communications networks, we evolve from geography to what he calls "connectography." This emerging global network civilization holds the promise of reducing pollution and inequality — and even overcoming geopolitical rivalries. In this talk, Khanna asks us to embrace a new maxim for the future: "Connectivity is destiny."' itemprop='description'>

											I want you to reimagine
how life is organized on earth.
											Think of the planet
like a human body that we inhabit.
											The skeleton is the transportation system
of roads and railways,
											bridges and tunnels, air and seaports
											that enable our mobility
across the continents.
											The vascular system that powers the body
											are the oil and gas pipelines
and electricity grids.
											that distribute energy.
											And the nervous system of communications
											is the Internet cables,
satellites, cellular networks
											and data centers that allow
us to share information.

											This ever-expanding infrastructural matrix
											already consists of 64 million
kilometers of roads,
											four million kilometers of railways,
											two million kilometers of pipelines
											and one million kilometers
of Internet cables.
											What about international borders?
											We have less than
500,000 kilometers of borders.

											Let&#39;s build a better map of the world.
											And we can start by overcoming
some ancient mythology.
											There&#39;s a saying with which
all students of history are familiar:
											&quot;Geography is destiny.&quot;
											Sounds so grave, doesn&#39;t it?
											It&#39;s such a fatalistic adage.
											It tells us that landlocked countries
are condemned to be poor,
											that small countries
cannot escape their larger neighbors,
											that vast distances are insurmountable.
											But every journey I take around the world,
											I see an even greater force
sweeping the planet:
											connectivity.

									<p>
											The global connectivity revolution,
in all of its forms —
											transportation, energy
and communications —
											has enabled such a quantum leap
in the mobility of people,
											of goods, of resources, of knowledge,
											such that we can no longer even think
of geography as distinct from it.
											In fact, I view the two forces
as fusing together
											into what I call &quot;connectography.&quot;

											Connectography represents a quantum leap
											in the mobility of people,
resources and ideas,

from political geography,
											which is how we legally divide the world,
											to functional geography,
											which is how we actually use the world,
											from nations and borders,
to infrastructure and supply chains.

											We are becoming
this global network civilization

two trillion dollars per year.
											Meanwhile, our global
infrastructure spending
											is projected to rise
to nine trillion dollars per year
											within the coming decade.
											And, well, it should.
											We have been living
off an infrastructure stock
											meant for a world population
of three billion,

seven billion to eight billion
