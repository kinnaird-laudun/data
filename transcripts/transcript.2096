<title>Travis Kalanick: Uber&#39;s plan to get more people into fewer cars | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Uber didn&#39;t start out with grand ambitions to cut congestion and pollution. But as the company took off, co-founder Travis Kalanick wondered if there was a way to get people using Uber along the same routes to share rides, reducing costs and carbon footprint along the way. The result: uberPOOL, the company&#39;s carpooling service, which in its first eight months took 7.9 million miles off the roads and 1,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the air in Los Angeles. Now, Kalanick says carpooling could work for commuters in the suburbs, too. &quot;With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation,&quot; he says, &quot;we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today.&quot;" />

<meta content="Uber's plan to get more people into fewer cars" itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Uber didn&#x0027;t start out with grand ambitions to cut congestion and pollution. But as the company took off, co-founder Travis Kalanick wondered if there was a way to get people using Uber along the same routes to share rides, reducing costs and carbon footprint along the way. The result: uberPOOL, the company&#x0027;s carpooling service, which in its first eight months took 7.9 million miles off the roads and 1,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the air in Los Angeles. Now, Kalanick says carpooling could work for commuters in the suburbs, too. "With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation," he says, "we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today."' itemprop='description'>

											Today I wanted to —
well, this morning —
											I want to talk about the future
of human-driven transportation;
											about how we can cut congestion,
pollution and parking
											by getting more people into fewer cars;
											and how we can do it
with the technology that&#39;s in our pockets.
											And yes, I&#39;m talking about smartphones ...
											not self-driving cars.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But to get started we&#39;ve got
to go back over 100 years.
											Because it turns out
there was an Uber way before Uber.
											And if it had survived,
											the future of transportation
would probably already be here.

											So let me introduce you to the jitney.
											In 1914 it was created or invented
by a guy named LP Draper.
											He was a car salesman from LA,
and he had an idea.
											Well, he was cruising around
downtown Los Angeles,
											my hometown,
											and he saw trolleys
											with long lines of people trying
to get to where they wanted to go.
											He said, well, why don&#39;t
I just put a sign on my car
											that takes people wherever
they want to go for a jitney —
											that was slang for a nickel.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so people jumped on board,
											and not just in Los Angeles
but across the country.
											And within one year,
											by 1915,
											there were 50,000
rides per day in Seattle,
											45,000 rides per day in Kansas
											and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.
											To give you some perspective,
											Uber in Los Angeles
											is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...
											100 years later.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so these are the trolley guys,
											the existing transportation
monopoly at the time.
											They were clearly not happy
about the jitney juggernaut.
											And so they got to work
											and they went to cities across the country
											and got regulations put in place
to slow down the growth of the jitney.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And there were all kinds of regulations.
											There were licenses —
often they were pricey.
											In some cities,
											if you were a jitney driver,
											you were required to be
in the jitney for 16 hours a day.
											In other cities,
											they required two jitney
drivers for one jitney.
											But there was a really
interesting regulation
											which was they had to
put a backseat light —
											install it in every Jitney —
											to stop a new pernicious innovation
which they called spooning.

											That&#39;s unfortunate ...
											because, well, when you can&#39;t share a car,
then you have to own one.
											And car ownership skyrocketed
											and it&#39;s no wonder that by 2007,
											there was a car for every man,
woman and child in the United States.
											And that phenomenon had gone global.
											In China by 2011,
											there were more car sales
happening in China than in the US.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, all this private ownership
of course had a public cost.
											In the US, we spend
7 billion hours a year,
											wasted, sitting in traffic.
											160 billion dollars in lost productivity,
											of course also sitting in traffic,
											and one-fifth of all
of our carbon footprint
											is spewed out in the air
by those cars that we&#39;re sitting in.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, that&#39;s only four percent
of our problem though.
											Because if you have to own a car
											then that means 96 percent of the time
your car is sitting idle.
											And so, up to 30 percent
of our land and our space
											is used storing these hunks of steel.
											We even have skyscrapers built for cars.
											That&#39;s the world we live in today.

									<p>
											Now, cities have been dealing
with this problem for decades.
											It&#39;s called mass transit.
											And even in a city like New York City,
											one of the most densely
populated in the world
											and one of the most sophisticated
mass transit systems in the world,
											there are still 2.5 million cars
that go over those bridges every day.
											Why is that?
											Well, it&#39;s because mass transit
hasn&#39;t yet figured out
											how to get to everybody&#39;s doorstep.
											And so back in San Francisco,
where I live,
											the situation&#39;s much worse,
											in fact, much worse around the world.

											And so the beginning
of Uber in 2010 was —
											well, we just wanted
to push a button and get a ride.
											We didn&#39;t have any grand ambitions.
											But it just turned out
											that lots of people wanted
to push a button and get a ride,
											and ultimately what we started to see
was a lot of duplicate rides.
											We saw a lot of people
											pushing the same button at the same time

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so we started thinking about,
											well, how do we make those two trips
and turn them into one.
											Because if we did,
that ride would be a lot cheaper —
											up to 50 percent cheaper —
											and of course for the city
											you&#39;ve got a lot more people
and a lot fewer cars.

that exponential growth happen.

we don&#39;t talk about,
											&quot;Hey, well, 100,000 people

											And every morning at about the same time,

											There&#39;s just one hitch ...
											it&#39;s called regulation.
											So 54 cents a mile, what is that?
											Well, that is what the US government
											has determined that the cost
of owning a car is per mile.
											You can pick up anybody
in the United States
											and take them wherever they want to go
at a moment&#39;s notice,
											for 54 cents a mile or less.
											But if you charge 60 cents a mile,
you&#39;re a criminal.
											But what if for 60 cents a mile
											we could get half a million more people
carpooling in Los Angeles?
											And what if at 60 cents a mile
											we could get 50 million people
carpooling in the United States?
											If we could,

to the lesson of the jitney.
											If by 1915 this thing was taking off,

the regulations that happened,
											if that thing could just keep going.
											How would our cities be different today?
											Would we have parks
in the place of parking lots?

probably just say,
											well, what we were trying to accomplish.
											And I think if you know
a little bit about our history,
											it makes a lot more sense.
											Which is, when we first got started,
											it was just black cars.
											It was literally you push a button
and get an S-Class.

											was almost what I would call
an immature version of a luxury brand

that was important for us
											to be more accessible,
											to be more hyperlocal,
											to be about the cities we were in
											and that&#39;s what you see
with the patterns and colors.
											And to be more iconic,
											because a U doesn&#39;t mean
anything in Sanskrit,
											and a U doesn&#39;t mean anything in Mandarin.

											at different times of the day
than they otherwise would have,
											and they&#39;re more likely to use it
in places they wouldn&#39;t have before.
											And what that means for a driver
is wherever he or she drops somebody off,
											they&#39;re much more likely
to get a pickup and get back in.
											And so what that means
is more trips per hour,
											more minutes of the hour
where they&#39;re productive
											and actually, earnings come up.

									<p>
											And we have cities where we&#39;ve done
literally five or six price cuts
											and have seen those price cuts
go up over time.
											So even in New York —
											We have a blog post
we call &quot;4 Septembers&quot; —
											compare the earnings
											September after September after September.
											Same month every year.
											And we see the earnings going up over time
											as the price comes down.
											And there&#39;s a perfect price point —
you can&#39;t go down forever.
											And in those places
where we bring the price down
											but we don&#39;t see those earnings pop,
											we bring the prices back up.

											So that addresses that first part.
											And then the enigma and all of this —
											I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am
											is one that gets really excited
about solving hard problems.
											And the way I like to describe it
is it&#39;s kind of like a math professor.
											You know? If a math professor
doesn&#39;t have hard problems to solve,
											that&#39;s a really sad math professor.
											And so at Uber we like the hard problems
											and we like getting excited
about those and solving them.
											But we don&#39;t want just any math problem,
											we want the hardest ones
that we can possibly find,
											and we want the one that if you solve it,
											there&#39;s a little bit of a wow factor.

											For us it&#39;s an interesting
challenge, right?
											Because, well —
											Google&#39;s been investing
in this since 2007,
											Tesla&#39;s going to be doing it,
Apple&#39;s going to be doing it,
											the manufacturers
are going to be doing it.
											This is a world that&#39;s going to exist,
and for good reason.
											A million people die a year in cars.
											And we already looked at the billions
or even trillions of hours worldwide
											that people are spending sitting in them,
driving frustrated, anxious.
											And think about the quality
of life that improves
											when you give people their time back
											and it&#39;s not so anxiety-ridden.

is that it&#39;s a challenge,

											resisting technology,

											we have to embrace it

									<p>
											But how do we optimistically
lead through it?
											Are there ways to partner with cities?
											Are there ways to have education systems,
vocational training, etc.,
											for that transition period.
											It will take a lot longer
than I think we all expect,
											especially that transition period.
											But it is a world that&#39;s going to exist,
