									<p>
											I thought I&#39;d begin with a scene of war.
											There was little to warn of the danger ahead.
											The Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED,
											an Improvised Explosive Device,
											along the side of the road with great care.
											By 2006, there were more than 2,500
											of these attacks every single month,
											and they were the leading cause of
											casualties among American soldiers
											and Iraqi civilians.
											The team that was hunting for this IED
											is called an EOD team—
											Explosives Ordinance Disposal—and
											they&#39;re the pointy end of the spear in the
											American effort to suppress these roadside bombs.
											Each EOD team goes out on about
											600 of these bomb calls every year,
											defusing about two bombs a day.
											Perhaps the best sign of how valuable they
											are to the war effort, is that
											the Iraqi insurgents put a $50,000 bounty
											on the head of a single EOD soldier.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Unfortunately, this particular call
											would not end well.
											By the time the soldier advanced close
											enough to see the telltale wires
											of the bomb, it exploded in a wave of flame.
											Now, depending how close you are
											and how much explosive has been packed
											into that bomb, it can cause death
											or injury. You have to be as far as
											50 yards away to escape that.
											The blast is so strong it can even break
											your limbs, even if you&#39;re not hit.
											That soldier had been on top of the bomb.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so when the rest of the team advanced
											they found little left. And that night the unit&#39;s
											commander did a sad duty, and he wrote
											a condolence letter back to the United
											States, and he talked about how hard the
											loss had been on his unit, about the fact
											that they had lost their bravest soldier,
											a soldier who had saved their lives
											many a time.
											And he apologized
											for not being able to bring them home.
											But then he talked up the silver lining
											that he took away from the loss.
											&quot;At least,&quot; as he wrote, &quot;when a robot dies,
											you don&#39;t have to write a letter
											to its mother.&quot;

									<p>
											That scene sounds like science fiction,
											but is battlefield reality already.
											The soldier in that case
											was a 42-pound robot called a PackBot.
											The chief&#39;s letter went, not to some
											farmhouse in Iowa like you see
											in the old war movies, but went to
											the iRobot Company, which is
											named after the Asimov novel
											and the not-so-great Will Smith movie,
											and... um... (Laughter)...
											if you remember that
											in that fictional world, robots started out
											carrying out mundane chores, and then
											they started taking on life-and-death decisions.
											That&#39;s a reality we face today.

											What we&#39;re going to do is actually just
											flash a series of photos behind me that
											show you the reality of robots used in war
											right now or already at the prototype stage.
											It&#39;s just to give you a taste.
											Another way of putting it is you&#39;re not
											going to see anything that&#39;s powered
											by Vulcan technology, or teenage
											wizard hormones or anything like that.
											This is all real. So why don&#39;t we
											go ahead and start those pictures.

											Something big is going on in war today,
											and maybe even the history of humanity
											itself. The U.S. military went into Iraq with
											a handful of drones in the air.
											We now have 5,300.
											We went in with zero unmanned ground
											systems. We now have 12,000.
											And the tech term &quot;killer application&quot;
											takes on new meaning in this space.

									<p>
											And we need to remember that we&#39;re
											talking about the Model T Fords,
											the Wright Flyers, compared
											to what&#39;s coming soon.
											That&#39;s where we&#39;re at right now.
											One of the people that I recently met with
											was an Air Force three-star general, and he
											said basically, where we&#39;re headed very
											soon is tens of thousands of robots
											operating in our conflicts, and these
											numbers matter, because we&#39;re not just
											talking about tens of thousands of today&#39;s
											robots, but tens of thousands of these
											prototypes and tomorrow&#39;s robots, because
											of course, one of the things that&#39;s operating
											in technology is Moore&#39;s Law,
											that you can pack in more and more
											computing power into those robots, and so
											flash forward around 25 years,
											if Moore&#39;s Law holds true,
											those robots will be close to a billion times
											more powerful in their computing than today.

									<p>
											And so what that means is the kind of
											things that we used to only talk about at
											science fiction conventions like Comic-Con
											have to be talked about in the halls
											of power and places like the Pentagon.
											A robots revolution is upon us.

											When historians look at this period, they&#39;re

											affect the &quot;how&quot; of war-fighting,
											they affect the &quot;who&quot; of fighting
											at its most fundamental level.
											That is, every previous revolution in war, be
											it the machine gun, be it the atomic bomb,
											was about a system that either shot faster,
											went further, had a bigger boom.
											That&#39;s certainly the case with robotics, but

									<p>
											Another way of putting this is that
											mankind&#39;s 5,000-year-old monopoly
											on the fighting of war is breaking down
											in our very lifetime. I&#39;ve spent
											the last several years going around
											meeting with all the players in this field,
											from the robot scientists to the science
											fiction authors who inspired them to the
											19-year-old drone pilots who are fighting
											from Nevada, to the four-star generals
											who command them, to even the Iraqi
											insurgents who they are targeting and what
											they think about our systems, and
											what I found interesting is not just
											their stories, but how their experiences
											point to these ripple effects that are going
											outwards in our society, in our law
											and our ethics, etc. And so what I&#39;d like
											to do with my remaining time is basically
											flesh out a couple of these.

									<p>
											So the first is that the future of war,
											even a robotics one, is not going to be
											purely an American one.
											The U.S. is currently ahead in military
											robotics right now, but we know that in
											technology there&#39;s no such thing as
											a permanent first move or advantage.
											In a quick show of hands, how many
											people in this room still use
											Wang Computers? (Laughter)
											It&#39;s the same thing in war. The British and
											the French invented the tank.
											The Germans figured out how
											to use it right, and so what we have to
											think about for the U.S. is that we are
											ahead right now, but you have
											43 other countries out there
											working on military robotics, and they
											include all the interesting countries like
											Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And this raises a bigger worry for me.
											How do we move forward in this revolution
											given the state of our manufacturing
											and the state of our science and
											mathematics training in our schools?
											Or another way of thinking about this is,
											what does it mean to go to war increasingly
											with soldiers whose hardware is made
											in China and software is written in India?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But just as software has gone open-source,
											so has warfare.
											Unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb,
											you don&#39;t need a massive manufacturing
											system to build robotics. A lot of it is
											off the shelf. A lot of it&#39;s even do-it-yourself.
											One of those things you just saw flashed
											before you was a raven drone, the handheld
											tossed one. For about a thousand dollars,
											you can build one yourself, equivalent to
											what the soldiers use in Iraq.

								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That raises another wrinkle when it comes
											to war and conflict. Good guys might play
											around and work on these as hobby kits,
											but so might bad guys.
											This cross between robotics and things like
											terrorism is going to be fascinating
											and even disturbing,
											and we&#39;ve already seen it start.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											During the war between Israel, a state,
											and Hezbollah, a non-state actor,
											the non-state actor flew
											four different drones against Israel.
											There&#39;s already a jihadi website
											that you can go on and remotely
											detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting
											at your home computer.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so I think what we&#39;re going to see is
											two trends take place with this.
											First is, you&#39;re going to reinforce the power
											of individuals against governments,
											but then the second is that
											we are going to see an expansion
											in the realm of terrorism.
											The future of it may be a cross between
											al Qaeda 2.0 and the
											next generation of the Unabomber.
											And another way of thinking about this
											is the fact that, remember, you don&#39;t have
											to convince a robot that they&#39;re gonna
											receive 72 virgins after they die
											to convince them to blow themselves up.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But the ripple effects of this are going to go
											out into our politics. One of the people that
											I met with was a former Assistant Secretary of
											Defense for Ronald Reagan, and he put it
											this way: &quot;I like these systems because
											they save American lives, but I worry about
											more marketization of wars,
											more shock-and-awe talk,
											to defray discussion of the costs.
											People are more likely to support the use
											of force if they view it as costless.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Robots for me take certain trends
											that are already in play in our body politic,
											and maybe take them to
											their logical ending point.
											We don&#39;t have a draft. We don&#39;t
											have declarations of war anymore.
											We don&#39;t buy war bonds anymore.
											And now we have the fact that we&#39;re
											converting more and more of our American
											soldiers that we would send into harm&#39;s
											way into machines, and so we may take
											those already lowering bars to war
											and drop them to the ground.

									<p>
											But the future of war is also going to be
											a YouTube war.
											That is, our new technologies don&#39;t merely
											remove humans from risk.
											They also record everything that they see.
											So they don&#39;t just delink the public:
											they reshape its relationship with war.
											There&#39;s already several thousand
											video clips of combat footage from Iraq
											on YouTube right now,
											most of it gathered by drones.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, this could be a good thing.
											It could be building connections between
											the home front and the war front
											as never before.
											But remember, this is taking place
											in our strange, weird world, and so
											inevitably the ability to download these
											video clips to, you know, your iPod
											or your Zune gives you
											the ability to turn it into entertainment.

											Soldiers have a name for these clips.
											They call it war porn.
											The typical one that I was sent was
											an email that had an attachment of
											video of a Predator strike taking out
											an enemy site. Missile hits,
											bodies burst into the air with the explosion.
											It was set to music.
											It was set to the pop song

									<p>
											This ability to watch more
											but experience less creates a wrinkle
											in the public&#39;s relationship with war.
											I think about this with a sports parallel.
											It&#39;s like the difference between
											watching an NBA game, a professional
											basketball game on TV, where the athletes
											are tiny figures on the screen, and
											being at that basketball game in person
											and realizing what someone seven feet

											But we have to remember,
											these are just the clips.
											These are just the ESPN SportsCenter
											version of the game. They lose the context.
											They lose the strategy.
											They lose the humanity. War just

									<p>
											Now the irony of all this is that
											while the future of war may involve
											more and more machines,
											it&#39;s our human psychology that&#39;s driving
											all of this, it&#39;s our human failings
											that are leading to these wars.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So one example of this that has
											big resonance in the policy realm is
											how this plays out on our very real
											war of ideas that we&#39;re fighting
											against radical groups.
											What is the message that we think we are
											sending with these machines versus what
											is being received in terms of the message.

											So one of the people that I met was
											a senior Bush Administration official,
											who had this to say about
											our unmanning of war:
											&quot;It plays to our strength. The thing that
											scares people is our technology.&quot;
											But when you go out and meet with people,
											for example in Lebanon, it&#39;s a very
											different story. One of the people
											I met with there was a news editor, and
											we&#39;re talking as a drone is flying above him,
											and this is what he had to say.
											&quot;This is just another sign of the coldhearted
											cruel Israelis and Americans,
											who are cowards because
											they send out machines to fight us.
											They don&#39;t want to fight us like real men,
											but they&#39;re afraid to fight,
											so we just have to kill a few of their soldiers
											to defeat them.&quot;

									<p>
											The future of war also is featuring
											a new type of warrior,
											and it&#39;s actually redefining the experience
											of going to war.
											You can call this a cubicle warrior.
											This is what one Predator drone pilot
											described of his experience fighting
											in the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada.
											&quot;You&#39;re going to war for 12 hours,
											shooting weapons at targets,
											directing kills on enemy combatants,
											and then you get in the car
											and you drive home and within 20 minutes,
											you&#39;re sitting at the dinner table

									<p>
											Now, the psychological balancing
											of those experiences is incredibly tough,
											and in fact those drone pilots have
											higher rates of PTSD than many
											of the units physically in Iraq.
											But some have worries that this
											disconnection will lead to something else,
											that it might make the contemplation of war
											crimes a lot easier when you have
											this distance. &quot;It&#39;s like a video game,&quot;
											is what one young pilot described to me
											of taking out enemy troops from afar.
											As anyone who&#39;s played Grand Theft Auto
											knows, we do things in the video world

											So much of what you&#39;re hearing from me
											is that there&#39;s another side
											to technologic revolutions,
											and that it&#39;s shaping our present
											and maybe will shape our future of war.
											Moore&#39;s Law is operative,

											We&#39;re gaining incredible new capabilities,
											but we&#39;re also seeing and experiencing
											new human dilemmas. Now,
											sometimes these are just &quot;oops&quot; moments,
											which is what the head of a robotics
											company described it, you just have
											&quot;oops&quot; moments. Well, what are
											&quot;oops&quot; moments with robots in war?
											Well, sometimes they&#39;re funny. Sometimes,
											they&#39;re like that scene from the
											Eddie Murphy movie &quot;Best Defense,&quot;
											playing out in reality, where they tested out
											a machine gun-armed robot, and during
											the demonstration it started spinning
											in a circle and pointed its machine gun
											at the reviewing stand of VIPs.
											Fortunately the weapon wasn&#39;t loaded
											and no one was hurt, but other times
											&quot;oops&quot; moments are tragic,
											such as last year in South Africa, where
											an anti-aircraft cannon had a
											&quot;software glitch,&quot; and actually did turn on
											and fired, and nine soldiers were killed.

									<p>
											We have new wrinkles in the laws of war
											and accountability. What do we do
											with things like unmanned slaughter?
											What is unmanned slaughter?
											We&#39;ve already had three instances of
											Predator drone strikes where we thought
											we got bin Laden, and it turned out
											not to be the case.
											And this is where we&#39;re at right now.
											This is not even talking about armed,
											autonomous systems
											with full authority to use force.
											And do not believe that that isn&#39;t coming.
											During my research I came across
											four different Pentagon projects

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so you have this question:
											what does this lead to issues like
											war crimes? Robots are emotionless, so
											they don&#39;t get upset if their buddy is killed.
											They don&#39;t commit crimes of rage
											and revenge.
											But robots are emotionless.
											They see an 80-year-old grandmother
											in a wheelchair the same way they see
											a T-80 tank: they&#39;re both
											just a series of zeroes and ones.
											And so we have this question to figure out:
											How do we catch up our 20th century
											laws of war, that are so old right now
											that they could qualify for Medicare,
											to these 21st century technologies?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so, in conclusion, I&#39;ve talked about
											what seems the future of war,
											but notice that I&#39;ve only used
											real world examples and you&#39;ve only seen
											real world pictures and videos.
											And so this sets a great challenge for
											all of us that we have to worry about well
											before you have to worry about your
											Roomba sucking the life away from you.
											Are we going to let the fact that what&#39;s
											unveiling itself right now in war
											sounds like science fiction and therefore
											keeps us in denial?
											Are we going to face the reality
											of 21st century war?
											Is our generation going to make the same
											mistake that a past generation did
											with atomic weaponry, and not deal with
											the issues that surround it until
											Pandora&#39;s box is already opened up?

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, I could be wrong on this, and
											one Pentagon robot scientist told me
											that I was. He said, &quot;There&#39;s no real
											social, ethical, moral issues when it comes
											to robots.
											That is,&quot; he added, &quot;unless the machine
											kills the wrong people repeatedly.
											Then it&#39;s just a product recall issue.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so the ending point for this is
											that actually, we can turn to Hollywood.
											A few years ago, Hollywood gathered
											all the top characters and created
											a list of the top 100 heroes and
											top 100 villains of all of Hollywood history,
											the characters that represented the best
											and worst of humanity.
											Only one character made it onto both lists:
											The Terminator, a robot killing machine.
											And so that points to the fact that
											our machines can be used
											for both good and evil, but for me
											it points to the fact that there&#39;s a duality
											of humans as well.

											This week is a celebration

											But one of the main reasons that we&#39;re
