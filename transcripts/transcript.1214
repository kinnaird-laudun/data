											Over the last two decades, India has become
											a global hub for software development
											and offshoring of back office services, as we call it,
											and what we were interested in finding out was that
											because of this huge industry that has started
											over the last two decades in India,
											offshoring software development and back office services,
											there&#39;s been a flight of white collar jobs
											from the developed world to India.
											When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs
											to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst
											amongst the Western populations.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining
											trend for support for free trade in the West.
											Now, the Western elites, however, have said
											this fear is misplaced.
											For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you
											have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman
											called &quot;The World Is Flat,&quot; he said, basically, in his book
											that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong
											because it assumes, it&#39;s based on a mistaken assumption
											that everything that can be invented has been invented.
											In fact, he says, it&#39;s innovation that will keep the West
											ahead of the developing world,
											with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done
											in the developed world, and the less sophisticated,
											shall we say, drudge work being done
											in the developing world.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, what we were trying to understand was,
											is this true?
											Could India become a source, or a global hub,
											of innovation, just like it&#39;s become a global hub
											for back office services and software development?
											And for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranam
											and I spent investigating this topic.
									</p>

											Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know,
											in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting
											the Western innovative model, say,
											&quot;Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras,
											if the Indians are so bloody smart?&quot; (Laughter)
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So initially, when we started our research, we went
											and met several executives, and we asked them,
											&quot;What do you think? Will India go from being a favored
											destination for software services and back office services
											to a destination for innovation?&quot;
											They laughed. They dismissed us.
											They said, &quot;You know what? Indians don&#39;t do innovation.&quot;
											The more polite ones said, &quot;Well, you know, Indians
											make good software programmers and accountants,
											but they can&#39;t do the creative stuff.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication,
											and people said, &quot;You know, it&#39;s nothing to do with Indians.
											It&#39;s really the rule-based, regimented education system
											in India that is responsible for killing all creativity.&quot;
											They said, instead, if you want to see real creativity,
											go to Silicon Valley, and look at companies
											like Google, Microsoft, Intel.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we started examining the R&amp;amp;D and innovation labs
											of Silicon Valley.
											Well, interestingly, what you find there is,
											usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab
											or the R&amp;amp;D center as they may call it,
											and more often than not, it&#39;s an Indian. (Laughter)
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I immediately said, &quot;Well, but you could not have been
											educated in India, right?
											You must have gotten your education here.&quot;
											It turned out, in every single case,
											they came out of the Indian educational system.
											So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question,
											and the right question is, really, can Indians
											based out of India do innovative work?
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So off we went to India. We made, I think,
											about a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon,
											Delhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examine
											what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.
											And what we found was, as we progressed in our research,
											was, that we were asking really the wrong question.
											When you ask, &quot;Where are the Indian Googles,
											iPods and Viagras?&quot; you are taking a particular perspective
											on innovation, which is innovation for end users,
											visible innovation.

											Instead, innovation, if you remember, some of you
											may have read the famous economist Schumpeter,
											he said, &quot;Innovation is novelty
											in how value is created and distributed.&quot;
											It could be new products and services,
											but it could also be new ways of producing products.
											It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Once you take this, there&#39;s no reason to restrict innovation,
											the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.
											When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation,
											what we found was, India is well represented
											in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India
											is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was
											we called it &quot;invisible innovation.&quot;
											And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation
											that are coming out of India.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The first type of invisible innovation out of India
											is what we call innovation for business customers,
											which is led by the multinational corporations,
											which have — in the last two decades, there have been
											750 R&amp;amp;D centers set up in India by multinational companies
											employing more than 400,000 professionals.
											Now, when you consider the fact that, historically,
											the R&amp;amp;D center of a multinational company
											was always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin
											of that multinational company, to have 750 R&amp;amp;D centers
											of multinational corporations in India
											is truly a remarkable figure.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											When we went and talked to the people in those innovation
											centers and asked them what are they working on,
											they said, &quot;We are working on global products.&quot;
											They were not working on localizing global products
											for India, which is the usual role of a local R&amp;amp;D.
											They were working on truly global products,
											and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca,
											General Electric, Philips, have already answered
											in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore
											and Hyderabad R&amp;amp;D centers they are able to produce
											products and services for the world.
											But of course, as an end user, you don&#39;t see that,
											because you only see the name of the company,
											not where it was developed.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The other thing we were told then was, &quot;Yes, but, you know,
											the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&amp;amp;D center
											cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out
											of the U.S. R&amp;amp;D centers.&quot;
											So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be
											one of the smartest people I know, said
											he&#39;s going to do a study.
											What he did was he looked at those companies
											that had an R&amp;amp;D center in USA and in India,
											and then he looked at a patent that was filed
											out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same
											company&#39;s subsidiary in India,
											so he&#39;s now comparing the patents of R&amp;amp;D centers
											in the U.S. with R&amp;amp;D centers in India of the same company
											to find out what is the quality of the patents filed
											out of the Indian centers and how do they compare
											with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Interestingly, what he finds is
											— and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent
											is what we call forward citations: How many times
											does a future patent reference the older patent? —
											he finds something very interesting.
											What we find is that the data says
											that the number of forward citations of a patent filed
											out of a U.S. R&amp;amp;D subsidiary is identical to the number
											of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary
											of the same company within that company.
											So within the company, there&#39;s no difference in the forward
											citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus
											their U.S. subsidiaries.
											So that&#39;s the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India
											is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies,
											where many companies today are contracting
											Indian companies to do a major part of their product
											development work for their global products
											which are going to be sold to the entire world.
											For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules
											are being developed, but you see a major part of that work
											is being sent to India.
											For example, XCL Technologies,
											they developed two of the mission critical systems
											for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,
											one to avoid collisions in the sky,
											and another to allow landing in zero visibility.
											But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,
											you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation
											out of India.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India
											is what we call process innovations, because of an injection
											of intelligence by Indian firms.
											Process innovation is different from product innovation.
											It&#39;s about how do you create a new product or develop
											a new product or manufacture a new product,
											but not a new product itself?
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

									<p>
											Only in India do millions of young people dream
											of working in a call center.
											What happens — You know, it&#39;s a dead end job in the West,
											what high school dropouts do.
											What happens when you put hundreds of thousands
											of smart, young, ambitious kids
											on a call center job?
											Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating,
											and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and
											out of this process innovation comes product innovations,
											which are then marketed around the world.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											For example, 24/7 Customer,
											traditional call center company, used to be a traditional
											call center company. Today they&#39;re developing
											analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before
											you pick up the phone, you can guess
											or predict what this phone call is about.
											It&#39;s because of an injection of intelligence into a process
											which was considered dead for a long time in the West.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation
											coming out of India is what we call management innovation.
											It&#39;s not a new product or a new process
											but a new way to organize work,
											and the most significant management innovation to come
											out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry
											is what we call the global delivery model.
											What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you
											to take previously geographically core-located tasks,
											break them up into parts, send them around the world
											where the expertise and the cost structure exists,
											and then specify the means for reintegrating them.
											Without that, you could not have any of the other
											invisible innovations today.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, what I&#39;m trying to say is, what we are finding
											in our research is, that if products for end users
											is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg,
											India is well represented in the invisible, large,
											submerged portion of the innovation iceberg.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, this has, of course, some implications,
											and so we developed three implications of this research.
											The first is what we called sinking skill ladder,
											and now I&#39;m going to go back to where I started my
											conversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.
											Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company,
											decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;amp;D,
											what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the
											bottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs,
											just like Tom Friedman would predict.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung
											of the ladder to India for innovation and for R&amp;amp;D work,
											at some stage in the very near future you are going to have
											to confront a problem,
											which is where does the next step
											of the ladder people come from within your company?
											So you have two choices then:
											Either you bring the people from India into
											the developed world to take positions in the next step
											of the ladder — immigration —
											or you say, there&#39;s so many people in the bottom step
											of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India,
											why don&#39;t we move the next step to India?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What we are trying to say is
											that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you —
											it&#39;s a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,
											and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that
											you can&#39;t be an investment banker
											without having been an analyst once.
											You can&#39;t be a professor without having been a student.
											You can&#39;t be a consultant without having been a research associate.
											So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,
											at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The second thing we bring up is what we call
											the browning of the TMT, the top management teams.
											If the R&amp;amp;D talent is going to be based out of India
											and China, and the largest growth markets
											are going to be based out of India and China,
											you have to confront the problem that
											your top management of the future
											is going to have to come out of India and China,
											because that&#39;s where the product leadership is,
											that&#39;s where the important market leadership is.

									<p>
											Right? And the last thing we point out in this slide,
											which is, you know, that to this story, there&#39;s one caveat.
											India has the youngest growing population in the world.
											This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically,
											there&#39;s also the mirage of mighty labor pools.
											Indian institutes and educational system,
											with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students
											in the quantity and quality needed
											to keep this innovation engine going,
											so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this,
											but in the end it does not absolve the government
											of the responsibility for creating this educational structure.

									<p>
											So finally, I want to conclude
											by showing you the profile of one company, IBM.
											As many of you know, IBM has always been considered
											for the last hundred years to be one of the most
											innovative companies.
											In fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history,
											I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies
											in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Here is the profile of employees of
											IBM over the last decade.
											In 2003, they had 300,000 employees,
											or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000
											were in America, 9,000 were in India.
											In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time
											the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,
											whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, in 2010, they decided they&#39;re not going to reveal
											this data anymore, so I had to make some estimates
											based on various sources.
											Here are my best guesses. Okay? I&#39;m not saying
											this is the exact number, it&#39;s my best guess.
											It gives you a sense of the trend.
											There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which
											98,000 are remaining in the U.S.,
											and 150,000 are in India.
											So you tell me, is IBM an American company,
											or an Indian company? (Laughter)
