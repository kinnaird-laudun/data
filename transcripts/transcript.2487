<title>Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò: Why Africa must become a center of knowledge again | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How can Africa, the home to some of the largest bodies of water in the world, be said to have a water crisis? It doesn&#39;t, says Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò -- it has a knowledge crisis. Táíwò suggests that lack of knowledge on important topics like water and food is what stands between Africa&#39;s current state and a future of prosperity. In a powerful talk, he calls for Africa to make the production of knowledge within the continent rewarding and reclaim its position as a locus of learning on behalf of humanity." />

<meta content="How can Africa, the home to some of the largest bodies of water in the world, be said to have a water crisis? It doesn't, says Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò — it has a knowledge crisis. Táíwò suggests that lack of knowledge on important topics like water and food is what stands between Africa's current state and a future of prosperity. In a powerful talk, he calls for Africa to make the production of knowledge within the continent rewarding and reclaim its position as a locus of learning on behalf of humanity." itemprop='description'>

											What stands between Africa&#39;s current

											One word:
											knowledge.
											If Africa is to become a continent
that offers the best life for humans,

											What use is there in producing lawyers

											The biggest crisis in Africa today
is the crisis of knowledge:
											how to produce it,
											how to manage it,
											and how to deploy it effectively.
											For instance, Africa does not
have a water crisis.
											It has a knowledge crisis
regarding its water,
											where and what types it is,
											how it can be tapped and made available
where and when needed to all and sundry.
											How does a continent that is home
											to some of the largest
bodies of water in the world —
											the Nile,
											the Niger,
											the Congo,
											the Zambezi
											and the Orange Rivers —
											be said to have a water crisis,

											While we wrongly dissipate our energies
fighting the wrong crises,
											all those who invest in knowledge about us
											are busy figuring out
how to pipe water from Libya&#39;s aquifers
											to quench Europe&#39;s thirst.
											Such is our knowledge
of our water resources
											that many of our countries have given up
											on making potable water a routine presence
											in the lives of Africans,
											rich or poor,
											high and low,
											rural and urban.
											We eagerly accept
what the merchants of misery
											and the global African Studies
safari professoriat
											and their aid-addled,
											autonomy-fearing African minions
											in government, universities
and civil society
											tell us regarding how nature
has been to stinting towards Africa
											when it comes to the distribution
of water resources in the world.
											We are content to run our cities

											It is yet another knowledge crisis

											what and where they are,
											and how they can be best managed
to make Africans live more lives
											that are worth living.
											Otherwise, how does one explain the fact
											that geography puts the source
of the River Nile in Ethiopia,

have water for their lives?
											And the same geography
puts California in the desert,

											The difference, obviously,
is not geography.
											It is knowledge.
											Colorado&#39;s aquifers
											grow California&#39;s pistachios.
											Why can&#39;t Libya&#39;s aquifers
											grow sorghum in northern Nigeria?
											Why does Nigeria not aspire
											to feed the world,
											not just itself?
											If Africa&#39;s land is so poor,
as we are often told,
											why are outsiders,
											from the United Arab Emirates
all the way to South Korea,
											buying up vast acreages of our land,
											to grow food, no less,
											to feed their people
											in lands that are truly more
geographically stinting?
											The new landowners are not planning
to import new topsoil
											to make their African
acquisitions more arable.
											Again, a singular instance
of knowledge deficiency.

											In the 19th century,
											our predecessors,
											just years removed from the ravages
of slavery and the slave trade,
											were exploring the Niger and Congo Rivers
											with a view to turning Africa&#39;s resources
to the advantage of its people
											and to the rest of humanity,
											and their 20th-century successors
were dreaming of harnessing
											the powers of the River Congo
											to light up the whole continent.
											Now only buccaneer capitalists from Europe
											are scheming of doing the same,
											but for exports to Europe
and South Africa.
											And they are even suggesting
											that Congolese may not
benefit from this scheme,
											because, according to them,
Congolese communities are too small

											Things have not always been this way
											when it comes to knowledge
production and Africa.
											In antiquity, the world went to Africa
for intellectual enrichment.
											There were celebrated centers of learning,
											attracting questers from all parts
of the then-known world,
											seeking knowledge about that world.
											What happened then
has implications for our present.
											For example,
											how Roman Africa managed the relationship
between settlers and natives
											between the second and fourth
centuries of our era
											might have something to teach us
when it comes to confronting
											not-too-dissimilar problems
at the present time.
											But how many classics departments
do we have in our universities?
											Because we do not invest in knowledge,
											people come to Africa now
											not as a place of intellectual enrichment,
											but as a place where they sate
their thirst for exotica.

											Yet for the last half-millennium,
											Africa has been hemorrhaging
and exporting knowledge
											to the rest of the world.
											Regardless of the popular description
of it as a trade in bodies,
											the European trans-Atlantic
slave trade and slavery
											was one of the most radical
and longest programs
											of African brains export in history.
											American slave owners may have pretended
that Africans were mere brutes,
											beasts of burden,

as other farm implements
											they classified them with

they were princes and princesses,

they were herbologists,

											The list is endless.
											They, to take a single example,
											brought the knowledge of rice cultivation

											For the last half-millennium,
beginning with the slave trade,
											Africa has been exporting brains
											while simultaneously breaking
the chains of knowledge transmission
											on the continent itself,
											with dire consequences for the systems
of knowledge production in Africa.
											Successive generations are cut off
from the intellectual production
											of their predecessors.
											We keep producing for external markets
											while beggaring our own internal needs.
											At present,
											much of the best knowledge about Africa
											is neither produced nor housed there,
											even when it is produced by Africans.
											Because we are dominated
by immediate needs
											and relevant solutions when it comes
to what we should know,
											we are happy to hand over to others
											the responsibility to produce knowledge,
											including knowledge about, of and for us,
											and to do so far away from us.
											We are ever eager to consume knowledge
											and have but a mere portion of it
											without any anxiety about
ownership and location.
											African universities
are now all too content
											to have e-connections
with libraries elsewhere,
											having given up ambitions
on building libraries
											to which the world would come
for intellectual edification.
											Control over who decides
what should be stocked on our shelves
											and how access to collections
should be determined
											are made to rest on our trust
in our partners&#39; good faith
											that they will not abandon us
down the road.

											This must change.
											Africa must become
a place of knowledge again.
											Knowledge production
actually expands the economy.
											Take archaeological digs, for instance,
											and their impact on tourism.
											Our desires to unearth our antiquity,
											especially those remote times
of which we have no written records,
											requires investment in archaeology
and related disciplines,
											e.g., paleoanthropology.
											Yet, although it is our past
we seek to know,
											by sheer serendipity,
											archaeology may shed light
on the global human experience
											and yield economic payoffs
											that were no part
of the original reasons for digging.

											We must find a way to make knowledge
and its production sexy and rewarding;
											rewarding, not in the crass
sense of moneymaking
											but in terms of making it worthwhile
to indulge in the pursuit of knowledge,
											support the existence
											of knowledge-producing
groups and intellectuals,
											ensuring that the continent
											becomes the immediate locus
of knowledge production,
											distribution and consumption,
											and that instead of having
its depositories

By itself, my living in Nigeria does not warrant comment. But the discovery that I speak of put that life in a completely different light; hence these remarks. All my life in Nigeria, I lived as a Yor&ugrave;b&aacute;, a Nigerian, an African, and a human being. I occupied, by turns, several different roles. I was a hugely successful Boy Scout. I was a well-read African cultural nationalist. I was a member of the Nigerian province of the worldwide communion of the Church of England who remains completely enamored of the well-crafted sermon and of church music, often given to impromptu chanting from memory of whole psalms, the Te Deum or the Nunc Dimittis. I was a student leader of national repute. I was an aspiring revolutionary who once entertained visions of life as a guerilla in the bush. I was a frustrated journalist who, to his eternal regret, could not resist the call of the teaching profession. I was an ardent football player of limited talent. I was a budding spiritualist who has since stopped professing faith. Overall, I always believed that I was put on Earth for the twin purposes of raising hell for and catching it from those who would dare shame humanity through either ignorance or injustice or poverty.&quot;</p><p>T&aacute;&iacute;w&ograve; is the author of <em>Legal Naturalism: A Marxist Theory of Law</em> (1996/2015), <em>How Colonialism Preempted Modernity in Africa</em> (2010) and <em>Africa Must Be Modern: A Manifesto</em> (2012/2014).</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/oluf_mi_taiwo_why_africa_must_become_a_center_of_knowledge_again","viewed_count":1035986,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò recommends","blurb":"Check out these resources, curated by Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":"","type":"recommendation","rec_lists":[{"title":"Reading List","description":"","rec_items":[{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*The Meanings of Timbuktu* ","blurb":"This volume documents the role of Timbuktu as a center of knowledge production in Africa, beyond Egypt, from the medieval period through the eighteenth century.","note":"Shamil Jeppie, Souleymane Bachir Diagne\r\nCODESRIA, 2009","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Meanings-Timbuktu-Shamil-Jeppie/dp/0796922047/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Article","headline":"\"Colonialism and Its Aftermath: The Crisis of Knowledge Production\"\r\n","blurb":"This is the piece in which I first articulated the idea that the most lasting impact of colonialism in Africa could be found in what I there called the crisis of knowledge production.","note":"Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò\r\n*Callaloo* 1993","link_url":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2932216","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*How Europe Underdeveloped Africa* ","blurb":"This is the classic account of Africa’s development up to the coming of European conquest and what the consequences of that conquest have been.","note":"Walter Rodney\r\nHoward University Press, 1974","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Europe-Underdeveloped-Africa-Walter-Rodney/dp/1574780484/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"EXPLORE","headline":"Sources on African contributions to knowledge production in the past","blurb":"Theophile Obenga, A Lost Tradition: African Philosophy in World History (The Source Editions, 1995)\r\n\r\nCivilization or Barbarism: an Authentic Anthropology (Lawrence Hill Books, 1991)\r\n\r\nThe African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality (Lawrence Hill Books, 1974)\r\n\r\nClaudia Zaslavsky, Africa Counts: Number and Patter in African Cultures, 3rd edition (Lawrence Hill Books, 1999)\r\n\r\nInnocent C.

African political thought at the Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell University in the US. As he writes: &quot;I was born in Nigeria. I lived there all my life save for the five unbroken years that I sojourned in Canada in search of the proverbial Golden Fleece. By itself, my living in Nigeria does not warrant comment. But the discovery that I speak of put that life in a completely different light; hence these remarks. All my life in Nigeria, I lived as a Yor&ugrave;b&aacute;, a Nigerian, an African, and a human being. I occupied, by turns, several different roles. I was a hugely successful Boy Scout. I was a well-read African cultural nationalist. I was a member of the Nigerian province of the worldwide communion of the Church of England who remains completely enamored of the well-crafted sermon and of church music, often given to impromptu chanting from memory of whole psalms, the Te Deum or the Nunc Dimittis. I was a student leader of national repute. I was an aspiring revolutionary who once entertained visions of life as a guerilla in the bush. I was a frustrated journalist who, to his eternal regret, could not resist the call of the teaching profession. I was an ardent football player of limited talent. I was a budding spiritualist who has since stopped professing faith. Overall, I always believed that I was put on Earth for the twin purposes of raising hell for and catching it from those who would dare shame humanity through either ignorance or injustice or poverty.&quot;</p><p>T&aacute;&iacute;w&ograve; is the author of <em>Legal Naturalism: A Marxist Theory of Law</em> (1996/2015), <em>How Colonialism Preempted Modernity in Africa</em> (2010) and <em>Africa Must Be Modern: A Manifesto</em> (2012/2014).</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò","tags":["Africa","history","library","leadership","agriculture","resources","philosophy","society","rivers","water"],"title":"Why Africa must become a center of knowledge again","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1035986}]}
