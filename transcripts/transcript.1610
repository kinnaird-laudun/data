<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When she became the attorney general of New Jersey in 2007, Anne Milgram quickly discovered a few startling facts: not only did her team not really know who they were putting in jail, but they had no way of understanding if their decisions were actually making the public safer. And so began her ongoing, inspirational quest to bring data analytics and statistical analysis to the US criminal justice system." />

									<p>
											In 2007, I became the attorney general
											of the state of New Jersey.
											Before that, I&#39;d been a criminal prosecutor,
											first in the Manhattan district attorney&#39;s office,
											and then at the United States Department of Justice.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But when I became the attorney general,
											two things happened that changed 
the way I see criminal justice.
											The first is that I asked what I thought
											were really basic questions.
											I wanted to understand who we were arresting,
											who we were charging,
											and who we were putting in our nation&#39;s jails
											and prisons.
											I also wanted to understand
											if we were making decisions
											in a way that made us safer.
											And I couldn&#39;t get this information out.
											It turned out that most big criminal justice agencies
											like my own
											didn&#39;t track the things that matter.
											So after about a month of being incredibly frustrated,
											I walked down into a conference room
											that was filled with detectives
											and stacks and stacks of case files,
											and the detectives were sitting there
											with yellow legal pads taking notes.
											They were trying to get the information
											I was looking for
											by going through case by case
											for the past five years.
											And as you can imagine,
											when we finally got the results, they weren&#39;t good.
											It turned out that we were doing
											a lot of low-level drug cases
											on the streets just around the corner
											from our office in Trenton.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The second thing that happened
											is that I spent the day in the Camden,
New Jersey police department.
											Now, at that time, Camden, New Jersey,
											was the most dangerous city in America.
											I ran the Camden Police
Department because of that.
											I spent the day in the police department,
											and I was taken into a room
with senior police officials,
											all of whom were working hard
											and trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden.
											And what I saw in that room,
											as we talked about how to reduce crime,
											were a series of officers with a
lot of little yellow sticky notes.
											And they would take a yellow sticky
and they would write something on it
											and they would put it up on a board.
											And one of them said, 
&quot;We had a robbery two weeks ago.
											We have no suspects.&quot;
											And another said, &quot;We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week. We have no suspects.&quot;
											We weren&#39;t using data-driven policing.
											We were essentially trying to fight crime
											with yellow Post-it notes.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, both of these things made me realize
											fundamentally that we were failing.
											We didn&#39;t even know who was
in our criminal justice system,
											we didn&#39;t have any data about
the things that mattered,
											and we didn&#39;t share data or use analytics
											or tools to help us make better decisions
											and to reduce crime.
											And for the first time, I started to think
											about how we made decisions.
											When I was an assistant D.A.,
											and when I was a federal prosecutor,
											I looked at the cases in front of me,
											and I generally made decisions based on my instinct
											and my experience.
											When I became attorney general,
											I could look at the system as a whole,
											and what surprised me is that I found
											that that was exactly how we were doing it
											across the entire system —
											in police departments, in prosecutors&#39;s offices,
											in courts and in jails.
											And what I learned very quickly
											is that we weren&#39;t doing a good job.
											So I wanted to do things differently.
											I wanted to introduce data and analytics
											and rigorous statistical analysis
											into our work.
											In short, I wanted to moneyball criminal justice.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, moneyball, as many of you know,
											is what the Oakland A&#39;s did,
											where they used smart data and statistics
											to figure out how to pick players
											that would help them win games,
											and they went from a system that 
was based on baseball scouts
											who used to go out and watch players
											and use their instinct and experience,

											It worked for the Oakland A&#39;s,
											and it worked in the state of New Jersey.
											We took Camden off the top of the list
											as the most dangerous city in America.
											We reduced murders there by 41 percent,
											which actually means 37 lives were saved.
											And we reduced all crime in the city by 26 percent.
											We also changed the way
we did criminal prosecutions.
											So we went from doing low-level drug crimes
											that were outside our building
											to doing cases of statewide importance,
											on things like reducing violence
with the most violent offenders,
											prosecuting street gangs,
											gun and drug trafficking, and political corruption.

											And all of this matters greatly,
											because public safety to me
											is the most important function of government.
											If we&#39;re not safe, we can&#39;t be educated,
											we can&#39;t be healthy,
											we can&#39;t do any of the other things
we want to do in our lives.
											And we live in a country today
											where we face serious criminal justice problems.
											We have 12 million arrests every single year.
											The vast majority of those arrests
											are for low-level crimes, like misdemeanors,
											70 to 80 percent.
											Less than five percent of all arrests
											are for violent crime.
											Yet we spend 75 billion,
											that&#39;s b for billion,
											dollars a year on state and local corrections costs.
											Right now, today, we have 2.3 million people
											in our jails and prisons.
											And we face unbelievable public safety challenges
											because we have a situation
											in which two thirds of the people in our jails
											are there waiting for trial.
											They haven&#39;t yet been convicted of a crime.
											They&#39;re just waiting for their day in court.
											And 67 percent of people come back.
											Our recidivism rate is amongst 
the highest in the world.
											Almost seven in 10 people who are released
											from prison will be rearrested
											in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration.

											So when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation,
											I came back to looking at a lot of these questions,
											and I came back to thinking about how
											we had used data and analytics to transform
											the way we did criminal justice in New Jersey.
											And when I look at the criminal justice system
											in the United States today,
											I feel the exact same way that I did
											about the state of New Jersey when I started there,
											which is that we absolutely have to do better,
											and I know that we can do better.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I decided to focus
											on using data and analytics
											to help make the most critical decision
											in public safety,
											and that decision is the determination
											of whether, when someone has been arrested,
											whether they pose a risk to public safety
											and should be detained,
											or whether they don&#39;t pose a risk to public safety
											and should be released.
											Everything that happens in criminal cases
											comes out of this one decision.
											It impacts everything.
											It impacts sentencing.
											It impacts whether someone gets drug treatment.
											It impacts crime and violence.
											And when I talk to judges around the United States,
											which I do all the time now,
											they all say the same thing,
											which is that we put dangerous people in jail,
											and we let non-dangerous, nonviolent people out.
											They mean it and they believe it.
											But when you start to look at the data,
											which, by the way, the judges don&#39;t have,
											when we start to look at the data,
											what we find time and time again,
											is that this isn&#39;t the case.
											We find low-risk offenders,
											which makes up 50 percent of our
entire criminal justice population,
											we find that they&#39;re in jail.
											Take Leslie Chew, who was a Texas man
											who stole four blankets on a cold winter night.
											He was arrested, and he was kept in jail
											on 3,500 dollars bail,
											an amount that he could not afford to pay.
											And he stayed in jail for eight months
											until his case came up for trial,
											at a cost to taxpayers of more than 9,000 dollars.
											And at the other end of the spectrum,
											we&#39;re doing an equally terrible job.
											The people who we find
											are the highest-risk offenders,
											the people who we think have the highest likelihood
											of committing a new crime if they&#39;re released,
											we see nationally that 50 percent of those people
											are being released.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The reason for this is the way we make decisions.
											Judges have the best intentions
											when they make these decisions about risk,
											but they&#39;re making them subjectively.
											They&#39;re like the baseball scouts 20 years ago
											who were using their instinct and their experience
											to try to decide what risk someone poses.
											They&#39;re being subjective,
											and we know what happens
with subjective decision making,
											which is that we are often wrong.
											What we need in this space
											are strong data and analytics.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What I decided to look for
											was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool,
											something that would let judges actually understand
											with a scientific and objective way
											what the risk was that was posed
											by someone in front of them.
											I looked all over the country,
											and I found that between five and 10 percent
											of all U.S. jurisdictions
											actually use any type of risk assessment tool,
											and when I looked at these tools,
											I quickly realized why.
											They were unbelievably expensive to administer,
											they were time-consuming,
											they were limited to the local jurisdiction
											in which they&#39;d been created.
											So basically, they couldn&#39;t be scaled
											or transferred to other places.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I went out and built a phenomenal team
											of data scientists and researchers
											and statisticians
											to build a universal risk assessment tool,
											so that every single judge in
the United States of America
											can have an objective, scientific measure of risk.
											In the tool that we&#39;ve built,
											what we did was we collected 1.5 million cases
											from all around the United States,
											from cities, from counties,
											from every single state in the country,
											the federal districts.
											And with those 1.5 million cases,
											which is the largest data set on pretrial
											in the United States today,
											we were able to basically find that there were
											900-plus risk factors that we could look at
											to try to figure out what mattered most.
											And we found that there were nine specific things
											that mattered all across the country
											and that were the most highly predictive of risk.
											And so we built a universal risk assessment tool.
											And it looks like this.
											As you&#39;ll see, we put some information in,
											but most of it is incredibly simple,
											it&#39;s easy to use,
											it focuses on things like the
defendant&#39;s prior convictions,
											whether they&#39;ve been sentenced to incarceration,
											whether they&#39;ve engaged in violence before,
											whether they&#39;ve even failed to come back to court.
											And with this tool, we can predict three things.
											First, whether or not someone will commit
											a new crime if they&#39;re released.
											Second, for the first time,
											and I think this is incredibly important,
											we can predict whether someone will commit
											an act of violence if they&#39;re released.
											And that&#39;s the single most important thing
											that judges say when you talk to them.
											And third, we can predict whether someone
											will come back to court.
											And every single judge in the
United States of America can use it,
											because it&#39;s been created on a universal data set.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What judges see if they run the risk assessment tool
											is this — it&#39;s a dashboard.
											At the top, you see the New Criminal Activity Score,
											six of course being the highest,
											and then in the middle you
see, &quot;Elevated risk of violence.&quot;
											What that says is that this person
											is someone who has an elevated risk of violence
											that the judge should look twice at.
											And then, towards the bottom,
											you see the Failure to Appear Score,
											which again is the likelihood
											that someone will come back to court.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now I want to say something really important.
											It&#39;s not that I think we should be eliminating
											the judge&#39;s instinct and experience
											from this process.
											I don&#39;t.
											I actually believe the problem that we see
											and the reason that we have
these incredible system errors,
											where we&#39;re incarcerating
low-level, nonviolent people
											and we&#39;re releasing high-risk, dangerous people,
											is that we don&#39;t have an objective measure of risk.
											But what I believe should happen
											is that we should take that
data-driven risk assessment
											and combine that with the
judge&#39;s instinct and experience
											to lead us to better decision making.
											The tool went statewide in Kentucky on July 1,
											and we&#39;re about to go up in a
number of other U.S. jurisdictions.
											Our goal, quite simply, is that every single judge
											in the United States will use a data-driven risk tool
											within the next five years.
											We&#39;re now working on risk tools
											for prosecutors and for police officers as well,
											to try to take a system that runs today
											in America the same way it did 50 years ago,
											based on instinct and experience,
											and make it into one that runs
											on data and analytics.

											Now, the great news about all this,
											and we have a ton of work left to do,
											and we have a lot of culture to change,
											but the great news about all of it
											is that we know it works.
											It&#39;s why Google is Google,
											and it&#39;s why all these baseball teams use moneyball
											to win games.
											The great news for us as well
											is that it&#39;s the way that we can transform
											the American criminal justice system.
											It&#39;s how we can make our streets safer,
											we can reduce our prison costs,
											and we can make our system much fairer
											and more just.
											Some people call it data science.
											I call it moneyballing criminal justice.
