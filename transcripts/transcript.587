											As a researcher, every once in a while
											you encounter something
											a little disconcerting.
											And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you,
											and teaches you that you&#39;re very wrong
											about something that you really believed firmly in.
											And these are unfortunate moments,
											because you go to sleep that night
											dumber than when you woke up.
											So, that&#39;s really the goal of my talk,
											is to A, communicate that moment to you
											and B, have you leave this session
											a little dumber than when you entered.
											So, I hope I can really accomplish that.

									<p>
											So, this incident that I&#39;m going to describe
											really began with some diarrhea.
											Now, we&#39;ve known for a long time the cause of diarrhea.
											That&#39;s why there&#39;s a glass of water up there.
											For us, it&#39;s a problem, the people in this room.
											For babies, it&#39;s deadly.
											They lack nutrients, and diarrhea dehydrates them.
											And so, as a result, there is a lot of death,
											a lot of death.
											In India in 1960,
											there was a 24 percent child mortality rate,
											lots of people didn&#39;t make it. This is incredibly unfortunate.
											One of the big reasons this happened was
											because of diarrhea.
											Now, there was a big effort to solve this problem,
											and there was actually a big solution.
											This solution has been called, by some,
											&quot;potentially the most important medical
											advance this century.&quot;
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, the solution turned out to be simple.
											And what it was was oral rehydration salts.
											Many of you have probably used this.
											It&#39;s brilliant. It&#39;s a way to get sodium
											and glucose together so that when you add it to water
											the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.
											Remarkable impact on mortality.
											Massive solution to the problem.
											Flash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortality
											has dropped to 6.5 percent today.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Still a big number, but a big drop.
											It looks like the technological problem is solved.
											But if you look, even today
											there are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths
											in India alone.
											What&#39;s going on here?
											Well the easy answer is, we just haven&#39;t gotten those salts
											to those people.
											That&#39;s actually not true.
											If you look in areas where these salts are completely available,
											the price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated.
											Maybe there&#39;s a biological answer.
											Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration
											alone doesn&#39;t solve. That&#39;s not true either.
											Many of these deaths were completely preventable,
											and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing,
											what I want to call &quot;the last mile&quot; problem.

											See, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains —
											technological, scientific, hard work,
											creativity, human ingenuity —
											to crack important social problems with technology solutions.
											That&#39;s been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years,
											that&#39;s mankind moving forward.
											But in this case we cracked it,
											but a big part of the problem still remains.
											Nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well,
											the last mile&#39;s proving incredibly stubborn.

											Now, that&#39;s for oral rehydration therapy.
											Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea.
											Well, it turns out — and this is where things get really disconcerting —
											it&#39;s not unique to diarrhea.
											It&#39;s not even unique to poor people in India.
											Here&#39;s an example from a variety of contexts.
											I&#39;ve put a bunch of examples up here.

											I&#39;ll start with insulin, diabetes
											medication in the U.S.
											OK, the American population.
											On Medicaid — if you&#39;re fairly poor you get Medicaid,
											or if you have health insurance — insulin is pretty straightforward.
											You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection;
											you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.
											Massive technological advance:
											took an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.
											Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?
											About on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.
											As a result, 25,000 people a year go blind,
											hundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year,
											for something that&#39;s solvable.

											Here&#39;s another example from technology:
											agriculture. We think
											there&#39;s a food problem, so we create new seeds.
											We think there&#39;s an income problem, so we create
											new ways of farming that increase income.
											Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we&#39;d already cracked.
											Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income.
											Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield
											when you mix different varieties of rice side by side.
											Some people are doing that,
											many are not. What&#39;s going on?
											This is the last mile.
											The last mile is, everywhere, problematic.

											Let me go back to diarrhea for a second.
											Here&#39;s a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey,
											which is a survey asked of many Indian women:
											&quot;Your child has diarrhea.
											Should you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?&quot;
											Just so you don&#39;t embarrass yourselves, I&#39;ll give you the right answer:
											It&#39;s increase.
											Now, diarrhea&#39;s interesting
											because it&#39;s been around for thousands of years,
											ever since humankind really
											lived side by side enough to have really polluted water.
											One Roman strategy that was very interesting
											was that — and it really gave them a comparative advantage —
											they made sure their soldiers didn&#39;t drink
											even remotely muddied waters.
											Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they&#39;re not that effective
											on the battlefield.
											So, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields,
											the breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water.

											So, here are these women. They&#39;ve seen their parents
											have struggled with diarrhea, they&#39;ve struggled with diarrhea,
											they&#39;ve seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question?
											In India, 35 to 50 percent say &quot;Reduce.&quot;
											Think about what that means for a second.
											Thirty-five to 50 percent of women
											forget oral rehydration therapy,
											they are increasing —
											they are actually making their child
											more likely to die through their actions.
											How is that possible?
											Well, one possibility — I think that&#39;s how most people respond to this —
											is to say, &quot;That&#39;s just stupid.&quot;
											I don&#39;t think that&#39;s stupid.
											I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.

											Here&#39;s another puzzle for all of you.
											One person walks into a car lot,

											They are saying, &quot;This is 35 miles per gallon. I&#39;m going to do
											the environmentally right thing, I&#39;m going to buy the Prius,

											I&#39;m going to do something good for the environment.

											Which one of these people has done more for the environment?

											Fifty versus 35, that&#39;s a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on.
											Turns out, go home and do the math,
											the nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons.
											Why? Because we don&#39;t care about miles per gallon, we care about
											gallons per mile.
											Think about how powerful that is if you&#39;re trying to encourage fuel efficiency.
											Miles per gallon is the way we present things.

									<p>
											If we want to encourage change of behavior,
											gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.
											Researchers have found these type of anomalies.
											Okay, back to BMW. What should they do?
											The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.
											This car, which is my Mini, doesn&#39;t look that safe.
											Here was BMW&#39;s brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign.
											They showed a BMW driving down the street.
											There&#39;s a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck.
											The car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn&#39;t get into an accident.

											BWM realizes safety, in people&#39;s minds, has two components.
											You can be safe because when you&#39;re hit, you survive,
											or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.
											Remarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.
											It harnesses something you already believe.
											Now, even if I persuaded you to do something,
											it&#39;s hard sometimes to actually get action as a result.
											You all probably intended to wake up,
											I don&#39;t know, 6:30, 7 a.m.
											This is a battle we all fight every day,
											along with trying to get to the gym.
											Now, this is an example of that battle,

											and so one of the fundamental challenges
											is how we would actually do that. OK?
