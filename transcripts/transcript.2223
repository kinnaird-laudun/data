<title>Julie Lythcott-Haims: How to raise successful kids -- without over-parenting | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: By loading kids with high expectations and micromanaging their lives at every turn, parents aren&#39;t actually helping. At least, that&#39;s how Julie Lythcott-Haims sees it. With passion and wry humor, the former Dean of Freshmen at Stanford makes the case for parents to stop defining their children&#39;s success via grades and test scores. Instead, she says, they should focus on providing the oldest idea of all: unconditional love." />

<meta content='How to raise successful kids — without over-parenting' itemprop='name'>
<meta content="By loading kids with high expectations and micromanaging their lives at every turn, parents aren't actually helping. At least, that's how Julie Lythcott-Haims sees it. With passion and wry humor, the former Dean of Freshmen at Stanford makes the case for parents to stop defining their children's success via grades and test scores. Instead, she says, they should focus on providing the oldest idea of all: unconditional love." itemprop='description'>

											You know, I didn&#39;t set out
to be a parenting expert.
											In fact, I&#39;m not very interested
in parenting, per Se.
											It&#39;s just that there&#39;s a certain style
of parenting these days
											that is kind of messing up kids,
											impeding their chances
to develop into theirselves.
											There&#39;s a certain style

											I guess what I&#39;m saying is,
											we spend a lot of time
being very concerned
											about parents who aren&#39;t involved enough
in the lives of their kids
											and their education or their upbringing,
											and rightly so.
											But at the other end of the spectrum,
											there&#39;s a lot of harm
going on there as well,
											where parents feel
a kid can&#39;t be successful
											unless the parent is protecting
and preventing at every turn
											and hovering over every happening,
and micromanaging every moment,
											and steering their kid towards
some small subset of colleges and careers.

											When we raise kids this way,
											and I&#39;ll say we,
											because Lord knows,
in raising my two teenagers,
											I&#39;ve had these tendencies myself,
											our kids end up leading
a kind of checklisted childhood.

											And here&#39;s what the checklisted
childhood looks like.
											We keep them safe and sound
											and fed and watered,
											and then we want to be sure
they go to the right schools,
											that they&#39;re in the right classes
at the right schools,
											and that they get the right grades
in the right classes in the right schools.
											But not just the grades, the scores,
											and not just the grades and scores,
but the accolades and the awards
											and the sports,
the activities, the leadership.
											We tell our kids, don&#39;t just join a club,
											start a club, because colleges
want to see that.
											And check the box for community service.
											I mean, show the colleges
you care about others.

to be a kid in this checklisted childhood.

no time for free play.

has to be enriching, we think.

											and we absolve them
of helping out around the house,
											and we even absolve them
of getting enough sleep
											as long as they&#39;re checking off
the items on their checklist.
											And in the checklisted childhood,
we say we just want them to be happy,
											but when they come home from school,
											what we ask about all too often first
											is their homework and their grades.
											And they see in our faces
											that our approval, that our love,
											that their very worth,

											and offer clucking praise like a trainer
at the Westminster Dog Show —

of the movie &quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot;
											we send our children the message:

											That is not what I&#39;m saying.

admission to a tiny number of colleges
											or entrance to a small number of careers,
											that that&#39;s too narrow a definition
of success for our kids.
											And even though we might help them
achieve some short-term wins
											by overhelping —
											like they get a better grade
if we help them do their homework,
											they might end up with a longer
childhood résumé when we help —
											what I&#39;m saying is that all of this
comes at a long-term cost
											to their sense of self.
											What I&#39;m saying is,
we should be less concerned
											with the specific set of colleges
											they might be able
to apply to or might get into
											and far more concerned that they have
the habits, the mindset, the skill set,
											the wellness, to be successful
wherever they go.
											What I&#39;m saying is,
											our kids need us to be a little
less obsessed with grades and scores
											and a whole lot more interested
											in childhood providing
a foundation for their success
											built on things like love
											and chores.

											Did I just say chores?
Did I just say chores? I really did.
											But really, here&#39;s why.
											The longest longitudinal study
of humans ever conducted

											It found that professional
success in life,
											which is what we want for our kids,
											that professional success in life
comes from having done chores as a kid,
											and the earlier you started, the better,
											that a roll-up-your-sleeves-
and-pitch-in mindset,
											a mindset that says,
there&#39;s some unpleasant work,
											someone&#39;s got to do it,
it might as well be me,
											a mindset that says,
											I will contribute my effort
to the betterment of the whole,

											A second very important finding
from the Harvard Grant Study

											So childhood needs to teach

The book emerged from her decade as Stanford University&#39;s Dean of Freshmen, where she was known for her fierce advocacy for young adults and received the university&#39;s Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award for creating &quot;the&quot; atmosphere that defines the undergraduate experience. She was also known for her fierce critique of the growing trend of parental involvement in the day-to-day lives of college students. Toward the end of her tenure as dean, she began speaking and writing widely on the harm of helicopter parenting. How to Raise an Adult is being published in over two dozen countries and gave rise to her TED Talk and a sequel which will be out in 2018. In the meantime, Lythcott-Haims&#39;s memoir on race, <em>Real American</em>, will be out in Fall 2017.</p><p>Lythcott-Haims&nbsp;is a graduate of Stanford University, Harvard Law School, and California College of the Arts.
