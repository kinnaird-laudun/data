											But I was thinking about this,
											and I realized that although
my new book makes me happy,
											and I think would make my mother happy,
											it&#39;s not really about happiness.
											So I decided instead,
I would talk about someone
											who I think has done as much
to make Americans happy
											as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,
											a man who is a great
personal hero of mine:
											someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,
											who is most famous
for reinventing spaghetti sauce.

											As far as I know, psychophysics
is about measuring things.
											And Howard is very interested
in measuring things.
											And he graduated
with his doctorate from Harvard,
											and he set up a little consulting shop
in White Plains, New York.
											And one of his first clients was Pepsi.
											This is many years ago,
back in the early 70s.
											And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,
											&quot;You know, there&#39;s this new
thing called aspartame,
											and we would like to make Diet Pepsi.
											We&#39;d like you to figure out
											how much aspartame we should put
in each can of Diet Pepsi
											in order to have the perfect drink.&quot;
											Now that sounds like an incredibly
straightforward question to answer,
											and that&#39;s what Howard thought.
											Because Pepsi told him,
											&quot;We&#39;re working with a band
between eight and 12 percent.
											Anything below eight percent
sweetness is not sweet enough;
											anything above 12 percent
sweetness is too sweet.
											We want to know: what&#39;s the sweet
spot between 8 and 12?&quot;
											Now, if I gave you this problem to do,
you would all say, it&#39;s very simple.
											What we do is you make up
a big experimental batch of Pepsi,
											at every degree of sweetness —
eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,
											all the way up to 12 —
											and we try this out
with thousands of people,
											and we plot the results on a curve,
											and we take the most popular
concentration, right?
											Really simple.

											Howard does the experiment,

											and all of a sudden he realizes
it&#39;s not a nice bell curve.
											In fact, the data doesn&#39;t make any sense.
											It&#39;s a mess. It&#39;s all over the place.
											Now, most people in that business,
in the world of testing food and such,
											are not dismayed
when the data comes back a mess.
											They think, &quot;Well, you know,

											&quot;You know, maybe we made an error

											&quot;You know, let&#39;s just

											And one day, he was sitting
in a diner in White Plains,

some work for Nescafé.
											And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning,
the answer came to him.
											And that is, that when they analyzed
the Diet Pepsi data,

											They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,
											and they should have been
looking for the perfect Pepsis.
											Trust me.
											This was an enormous revelation.
											This was one of the most brilliant

											Howard immediately went on the road,

											In fact, Campbell&#39;s Soup
is where Howard made his reputation.
											Campbell&#39;s made Prego,
											and Prego, in the early 80s,
was struggling next to Ragù,
											which was the dominant
spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.
											In the industry — I don&#39;t
know whether you care about this,
											or how much time I have to go into this.
											But it was, technically speaking
— this is an aside —
											Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.
											The quality of the tomato paste
is much better;
											the spice mix is far superior;
											it adheres to the pasta
in a much more pleasing way.
											In fact, they would do
the famous bowl test
											back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.
											You&#39;d have a plate of spaghetti,
and you would pour it on, right?
											And the Ragù would all go to the bottom,
and the Prego would sit on top.
											That&#39;s called &quot;adherence.&quot;
											And, anyway, despite the fact
that they were far superior in adherence,
											and the quality of their tomato paste,
											Prego was struggling.

											And Howard looked
at their product line, and he said,

											And he got together
with the Campbell&#39;s soup kitchen,
											and he made 45 varieties
of spaghetti sauce.
											And he varied them according
to every conceivable way
											that you can vary tomato sauce:
											by sweetness, by level of garlic,

by tartness, by sourness,
											by visible solids —
											my favorite term
in the spaghetti sauce business.

											he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.
											And he brought in people
by the truckload into big halls.
											And he sat them down for two hours,
											and over the course of that two hours,
he gave them ten bowls.
											Ten small bowls of pasta,
											with a different spaghetti
sauce on each one.

											At the end of that process,
after doing it for months and months,
											he had a mountain of data
											about how the American people
feel about spaghetti sauce.
											And then he analyzed the data.
											Did he look for the most popular
variety of spaghetti sauce?
											No! Howard doesn&#39;t believe
that there is such a thing.
											Instead, he looked
at the data, and he said,
											let&#39;s see if we can group all these
different data points into clusters.
											Let&#39;s see if they congregate
around certain ideas.
											And sure enough, if you sit down,
											and you analyze all this data
on spaghetti sauce,
											you realize that all Americans
fall into one of three groups.
											There are people
who like their spaghetti sauce plain;
											there are people
who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;

who like it extra chunky.

the third one was the most significant,

extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.
											And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,
											&quot;You&#39;re telling me

their spaghetti sauce,

seven different kinds of vinegar,

for Ragù that he did for Prego.

											It is, in fact, enormously important.

											What Howard did is he fundamentally
changed the way the food industry thinks
											about making you happy.
											Assumption number one
in the food industry used to be
											that the way to find out
what people want to eat,
											what will make people happy,
is to ask them.
											And for years and years and years,
											Ragù and Prego would have focus groups,
											and they would sit you down,
and they would say,
											&quot;What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?
											Tell us what you want
in a spaghetti sauce.&quot;
											And for all those years — 20, 30 years —
											through all those focus group sessions,
											no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.
											Even though at least a third of them,
deep in their hearts, actually did.

											And a critically important step
											in understanding
our own desires and tastes
											is to realize that we cannot always
explain what we want, deep down.
											If I asked all of you, for example,

											you know what you&#39;d say?

when you ask them.

&quot;Dark, rich, hearty roast!&quot;
											What percentage of you actually
like a dark, rich, hearty roast?

											So that&#39;s number one thing
that Howard did.
											Number two thing that Howard did
is he made us realize —
											it&#39;s another very critical point —
											he made us realize the importance
											of what he likes to call
&quot;horizontal segmentation.&quot;
											Why is this critical?
											Because this is the way the food industry
thought before Howard.
											What were they obsessed with
in the early 80s?
											They were obsessed with mustard.
											In particular, they were obsessed
with the story of Grey Poupon.
											Used to be, there were two mustards:
French&#39;s and Gulden&#39;s.
											What were they? Yellow mustard.
											What&#39;s in it?
											Yellow mustard seeds,
turmeric, and paprika.
											That was mustard.
											Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.
											Right?
											Much more volatile brown mustard seed,
some white wine, a nose hit,
											much more delicate aromatics.
											And what do they do?
											They put it in a little tiny glass jar,
with a wonderful enameled label on it,
											made it look French,
											even though it&#39;s made
in Oxnard, California.

									<p>
											And instead of charging a dollar fifty
for the eight-ounce bottle,
											the way that French&#39;s and Gulden&#39;s did,
											they decided to charge four dollars.
											And they had those ads.
											With the guy in the Rolls Royce,
eating the Grey Poupon.
											Another pulls up, and says,
&quot;Do you have any Grey Poupon?&quot;
											And the whole thing, after they did that,
Grey Poupon takes off!

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And everyone&#39;s take-home lesson from that

											something to aspire to.
											It&#39;s to make them turn their back

											Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce,
on a horizontal plane.
											There is no good mustard or bad mustard.
											There is no perfect mustard
or imperfect mustard.
											There are only different kinds of mustards
that suit different kinds of people.

											Now that same idea fueled
the commercial food industry as well.
											They had a Platonic notion
of what tomato sauce was.
											And where did that come from?
It came from Italy.
											Italian tomato sauce is what?
											It&#39;s blended; it&#39;s thin.
											The culture of tomato sauce was thin.
											When we talked about &quot;authentic
tomato sauce&quot; in the 1970s,
											we talked about Italian tomato sauce,
											we talked about the earliest Ragùs,
											which had no visible solids, right?
											Which were thin, you just put a little bit
											and it sunk down to the bottom
of the pasta.
											That&#39;s what it was.
											And why were we attached to that?
											Because we thought
that what it took to make people happy
											was to provide them with the most
culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.
											And B, we thought that if we gave them
the culturally authentic tomato sauce,
											then they would embrace it.

											In other words,
											people in the cooking world
were looking for cooking universals.
											They were looking for one way
to treat all of us.
											And it&#39;s good reason for them
to be obsessed
											with the idea of universals,
											because all of science,
											through the 19th century
and much of the 20th,
											was obsessed with universals.
											Psychologists, medical scientists,
economists
											were all interested
in finding out the rules
											that govern the way all of us behave.
											But that changed, right?
											What is the great revolution
in science of the last 10, 15 years?
											It is the movement
from the search for universals
											to the understanding of variability.
											Now in medical science,
we don&#39;t want to know, necessarily,
											just how cancer works,
											we want to know how your cancer
is different from my cancer.
											I guess my cancer different
from your cancer.
											Genetics has opened the door
to the study of human variability.
											What Howard Moskowitz
was doing was saying,
											&quot;This same revolution needs to happen
in the world of tomato sauce.&quot;
											And for that, we owe him
a great vote of thanks.

											I&#39;ll give you one last
illustration of variability,
											and that is — oh, I&#39;m sorry.
											Howard not only believed that,
but he took it a second step,
											which was to say that when we pursue
universal principles in food,
											we aren&#39;t just making an error;
											we are actually doing ourselves
a massive disservice.
											And the example he used was coffee.
											And coffee is something he did
a lot of work with, with Nescafé.
											If I were to ask all of you to try
and come up with a brand of coffee —
											a type of coffee, a brew —
that made all of you happy,
											and then I asked you to rate that coffee,
											the average score in this room for coffee
would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.
											If, however, you allowed me
to break you into coffee clusters,
											maybe three or four coffee clusters,
											and I could make coffee just
for each of those individual clusters,
											your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.
											The difference between coffee
at 60 and coffee at 78
											is a difference between coffee
that makes you wince,
											and coffee that makes you
deliriously happy.

									<p>
											That is the final, and I think
most beautiful lesson,
											of Howard Moskowitz:
											that in embracing the diversity
of human beings,
											we will find a surer way
to true happiness.

for the counterintuitive in what we all take to be the mundane: cookies, sneakers, pasta sauce. A <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer since 1996, he visits obscure laboratories and infomercial set kitchens as often as the hangouts of freelance cool-hunters -- a sort of pop-R&amp;D gumshoe -- and for that has become a star lecturer and bestselling author.<br /> <br />Sparkling with curiosity, undaunted by difficult research (yet an eloquent, accessible writer), <strong>his work uncovers truths hidden in strange data</strong>. His always-delightful <a href=\"http://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> tackles topics from serial killers to steroids in sports, while provocative recent work in the <em>New Yorker</em> <a href=\"http://www.gladwell.com/2007/2007_12_17_c_iq.html\" target=\"_blank\">sheds new light on the Flynn effect</a> -- the decades-spanning rise in I.Q. scores.<br /> <br />Gladwell has written four books. <a href=\"http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Tipping Point</em></a>, which began as a <em>New Yorker</em> piece, applies the principles of epidemiology to crime (and sneaker sales), while <a href=\"http://www.gladwell.com/blink/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blink</em></a> examines the unconscious processes that allow the mind to &quot;thin slice&quot; reality -- and make decisions in the blink of an eye. His third book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/outlierssuccess\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Outliers</em></a>, questions the inevitabilities of success and identifies the relation of success to nature versus nurture.
