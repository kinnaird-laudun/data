<title>Dan Gross: Why gun violence can&#39;t be our new normal | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: It doesn&#39;t matter whether you love or hate guns; it&#39;s obvious that the US would be a safer place if there weren&#39;t thousands of them sold every day without background checks. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, makes a passionate, personal appeal for something that more than 90 percent of Americans want: background checks for all gun sales. &quot;For every great movement around the world, there&#39;s a moment where you can look back and say, &#39;That&#39;s when things really started to change,&#39;&quot; Gross says. &quot;For the movement to end gun violence in America, that moment is here.&quot;" />

<meta content='It doesn&#x0027;t matter whether you love or hate guns; it&#x0027;s obvious that the US would be a safer place if there weren&#x0027;t thousands of them sold every day without background checks. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, makes a passionate, personal appeal for something that more than 90 percent of Americans want: background checks for all gun sales. "For every great movement around the world, there&#x0027;s a moment where you can look back and say, &#x0027;That&#x0027;s when things really started to change,&#x0027;" Gross says. "For the movement to end gun violence in America, that moment is here."' itemprop='description'>

											OK, so, confession:
											I&#39;ve always been weirdly
obsessed with advertising.
											I remember watching
Saturday morning cartoons,
											paying more attention to the commercials
											than to the shows,
											trying to figure out how they were trying
to get inside my head.
											Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.
											I became a partner
at a big New York ad agency.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But then, all of that suddenly changed
on February 23, 1997,
											when my little brother Matt
was shot in the head
											in a shooting that happened
on the observation deck
											of the Empire State Building.
											Suddenly, my family was thrown
into the middle of a nightmare,
											being told that my brother
was going to die,
											actually being given the opportunity
to say goodbye to him,
											then several emergency brain surgeries
											and now what&#39;s amounted, for Matt,
											to a lifetime spent courageously
recovering from a traumatic brain injury.
											He is definitely my hero.

									<p>
											But as much as this tragedy
was a nightmare for my family,
											I often think about how much worse
it could have been;
											in fact, how much worse
it is for the 90 families every day
											who aren&#39;t as fortunate,
											who lose loved ones — brothers,
sisters, sons, daughters, parents.
											They don&#39;t all make national headlines.
											In fact, most of them don&#39;t.
											They go largely unnoticed,
											in a nation that&#39;s kind of come to accept
a disgraceful national epidemic
											as some kind of new normal.

											So I quit my job in advertising
											to try and do something about
this disgraceful national epidemic,
											because I came to realize
											that the challenges
to preventing gun violence
											are actually the same ones
that made me love advertising,
											which is to try to figure out
how to engage people.
											Only instead of doing it to sell products,
											doing it to save lives.
											And that comes down to
finding common ground,
											where what I want overlaps
with what you want.
											And you might be surprised to learn,
when it comes to gun violence,
											just how much common ground there is.

											Let&#39;s look, for example,
at people who love to hunt,
											a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.
											It&#39;s a proud tradition. Families.
											In some places,
											the first day of hunting season
is actually a school holiday.
											What do hunters want?
											Well, they want to hunt.
They love their guns.
											They believe deeply
											in the Second Amendment right
to own those guns.
											But that doesn&#39;t mean
there isn&#39;t common ground.

											In fact, there&#39;s a lot of it,
											starting with the basic idea
of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.
											This isn&#39;t about taking
certain guns away from all people.
											It&#39;s about keeping all guns
away from certain people,
											and it&#39;s the people that, it turns out,
we all agree shouldn&#39;t have guns:
											convicted violent criminals,
domestic abusers,
											the dangerously mentally ill.
											We can all appreciate
											how Brady background checks
have been incredibly effective
											in keeping guns
out of those dangerous hands.
											In 20 years, Brady background checks
at federally licensed firearm dealers
											have blocked 2.4 million gun sales
											to those people that we all agree
shouldn&#39;t have guns.

											90 percent of Americans support
expanding Brady background checks

90 percent of Republicans,

											This is not a controversial idea.

in the hands and homes

like you and me,
											who want what we all want —
including keeping our families safe.
											In fact, that&#39;s why more and more people
are choosing to own guns.
											Ten years ago, 42 percent
of the American public

makes your home safer.

a big enough lie enough times,

											And that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened here.
											The corporate gun lobby
has spent billions of dollars

											blocking pediatricians
from talking to parents
											about the dangers of guns in the home;
											blocking smart-gun technology

											Every day in the US,

											900 children and teens
take their own lives every year.
											And here&#39;s the thing:
they&#39;re almost all with a parent&#39;s gun.
											Even two-thirds of school shootings
happen with a gun taken from the home,

											I meet so many of these parents;

											These are not bad people.
											They&#39;re just living with the unimaginable
consequences of a very bad decision,

											Let&#39;s look at the political elections
that are heating up.
											This used to be the classic
third-rail issue for Democrats.
											Couldn&#39;t run from it fast enough.
											Now candidates are running on it.
											Some are being forced
to reverse very bad positions

											For somebody like me,
											watching people wave around
their negative NRA ratings —
											it&#39;s almost surreal to watch.
											We&#39;re still outfunded, yes,
by the corporate gun lobby,
											and ultimately that needs to change.
											But you know what?
											We&#39;re smarter and we&#39;re scrappier,

											You know, they say that the Internet
democratizes information.
											Social media and some
of the organizing tools that plug into it

											It&#39;s allowed us to show what 90 percent
support really looks like.
											Sometimes I think of it —
											you know, we&#39;re converging
and attacking instantly by the millions,
											kind of like white blood cells.
											It&#39;s enabled us to start to really
close — and this is the bottom line —

											Until recently,
											the narrative in Congress
was that calls from the other side,
											from that six percent,
											outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one.
											We&#39;re flipping that narrative on its head.
											After that recent terrible tragedy
in San Bernardino,
											we jammed Congressional switchboards.
											We put 15,000 calls
into Congress in 24 hours.
											And you know what?
											We got a vote on a bill
											that nobody thought was going to see
the light of day anytime soon.
											We&#39;re seeing real movement
to repeal some of the most evil,
											ugly gun lobby legislation
passed over the last dark decade.
											The stranglehold of the gun lobby
is clearly being broken.
											We&#39;ve seen President Obama&#39;s
historic executive actions.
											They don&#39;t go all the way,
											but they are going to save lives,
											because they expand
Brady background checks
											to thousands of gun sales
that didn&#39;t have them previously.
											And we&#39;re marching across the country —
we&#39;re not just waiting
											for Congress to act; that would almost
be the definition of insanity.
											We&#39;re marching across the country,
											state by state, marriage-equality style.
