											So the machine I&#39;m going to talk you about
											is what I call the greatest machine that never was.
											It was a machine that was never built,
											and yet, it will be built.
											It was a machine that was designed
											long before anyone thought about computers.

											If you know anything about the history of computers,
											you will know that in the &#39;30s and the &#39;40s,
											simple computers were created
											that started the computer revolution we have today,
											and you would be correct,
											except for you&#39;d have the wrong century.
											The first computer was really designed
											in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.
											It was designed, and parts of it were prototyped,
											and the bits of it that were built are here
											in South Kensington.

											That machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage.
											Now, I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage
											because his hair is always completely unkempt like this
											in every single picture. (Laughter)
											He was a very wealthy man, and a sort of,
											part of the aristocracy of Britain,
											and on a Saturday night in Marylebone,
											were you part of the intelligentsia of that period,
											you would have been invited round to his house
											for a soiree — and he invited everybody:
											kings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people —
											and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.

									<p>
											I really miss that era, you know, where you could
											go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer
											get demonstrated to you. (Laughter)
											But Babbage, Babbage himself was born
											at the end of the 18th century,
											and was a fairly famous mathematician.
											He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge,
											and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.
											He&#39;s less well known than either of them because
											he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices
											and never made any of them.

											The reason he never made any of them, he&#39;s a classic nerd.
											Every time he had a good idea, he&#39;d think,
											&quot;That&#39;s brilliant, I&#39;m going to start building that one.
											I&#39;ll spend a fortune on it. I&#39;ve got a better idea.
											I&#39;m going to work on this one. (Laughter) And I&#39;m going to do this one.&quot;
											He did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister,
											basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street,
											and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying,
											&quot;I bid you good day, sir.&quot; (Laughter)

											The thing he designed was this monstrosity here,
											the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,
											this is a view from above.
											Every one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs,
											and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.
											So as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine
											this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds
											of what this thing would have sounded like.
											And I&#39;m going to take you through the architecture of the machine
											— that&#39;s why it&#39;s computer architecture —
											and tell you about this machine, which is a computer.

											So let&#39;s talk about the memory. The memory
											is very like the memory of a computer today,
											except it was all made out of metal,
											stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.
											Imagine a thing this high of cogs,
											hundreds and hundreds of them,
											and they&#39;ve got numbers on them.
											It&#39;s a decimal machine. Everything&#39;s done in decimal.
											And he thought about using binary. The problem
											with using binary is that the machine would have been so
											tall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it&#39;s enormous.
											So he&#39;s got memory.
											The memory is this bit over here.
											You see it all like this.

											The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic —

											which already is a bit of a feat in metal,
											but it could also do something that a computer does

											this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.
											It could do the &quot;if then&quot; for basic programmers,

											All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does,

											Babbage used the technology of the day
											and the technology that would reappear in the &#39;50s, &#39;60s and &#39;70s,
											which is punch cards. This thing over here
											is one of three punch card readers in here,
											and this is a program in the Science Museum, just
											not far from here, created by Charles Babbage,
											that is sitting there — you can go see it —
											waiting for the machine to be built.
											And there&#39;s not just one of these, there&#39;s many of them.

											Now, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard,
											in France, had created the Jacquard loom,
											which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards,
											so he was just repurposing the technology of the day,
											and like everything else he did, he&#39;s using the technology
											of his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam,
											mechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year
											as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday,
											who would completely revolutionize everything
											with the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.
											Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology,

											or the machine needed the attendant to come to it,
											there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)
											And there&#39;s actually an instruction on the punch card
											which says &quot;Ring the bell.&quot; So you can imagine this &quot;Ting!&quot;

											did build in the &#39;80s and &#39;90s.
											It&#39;s completely mechanical, again, a printer.

											Along comes this woman, Ada Lovelace.

											Everything&#39;ll be fine. So she&#39;s got this mathematical training,

											The Duke of Wellington is there, you know,

											Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.
											He was building a machine to do mathematics,
											and Lovelace said, &quot;You could do more than mathematics
											on this machine.&quot; And just as you do,
											everyone in this room already&#39;s got a computer on them
											right now, because they&#39;ve got a phone.
											If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone
											or computer or any other computing device
											is mathematics. It&#39;s all numbers at the bottom.
											Whether it&#39;s video or text or music or voice, it&#39;s all numbers,
											it&#39;s all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening,
											and Lovelace said, &quot;Just because you&#39;re doing
											mathematical functions and symbols
											doesn&#39;t mean these things can&#39;t represent
											other things in the real world, such as music.&quot;
											This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying,
											&quot;We could compute these amazing functions and print out
											tables of numbers and draw graphs,&quot; — (Laughter) —
											and Lovelace is there and she says, &quot;Look,
											this thing could even compose music if you
											told it a representation of music numerically.&quot;
											So this is what I call Lovelace&#39;s Leap.
											When you say she&#39;s a programmer, she did do some,
											but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be
											much, much more than this.

											Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along,
											Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.
											Now, of course, Babbage&#39;s machine was entirely mechanical.
											Turing&#39;s machine was entirely theoretical.
											Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective,
											but Turing told us something very important.
											He laid down the mathematical foundations
											for computer science, and said,
											&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter how you make a computer.&quot;
											It doesn&#39;t matter if your computer&#39;s mechanical,
											like Babbage&#39;s was, or electronic, like computers are today,
											or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again,
											mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.
											We could go back to Babbage&#39;s machine
											and just make it tiny. All those things are computers.
											There is in a sense a computing essence.
											This is called the Church–Turing thesis.

											And so suddenly, you get this link where you say
											this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.
											In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today
											with computers, only really slowly. (Laughter)
											To give you an idea of how slowly,
											it had about 1k of memory.
											It used punch cards, which were being fed in,
											and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
											It did have a RAM pack.
											You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to.

											(Laughter) So, where does that bring us today?
											So there are plans.
											Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives,
											there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages
											of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.
											One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28,
											and that is also the name of a charity that I started
											with Doron Swade, who was the curator of computing
											at the Science Museum, and also the person who drove
											the project to build a difference engine,

											The project has a number of parts to it.
											One was the scanning of Babbage&#39;s archive.
											That&#39;s been done. The second is now the study
											of all of those plans to determine what to build.
											The third part is a computer simulation of that machine,

											When it&#39;s built, you&#39;ll finally be able to understand how a computer works,
											because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,
											you&#39;ve got to look at this humongous thing and say, &quot;Ah,
