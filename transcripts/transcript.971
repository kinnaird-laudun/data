											My topic
											is economic growth in China and India.
											And the question I want to explore with you
											is whether or not
											democracy has helped or has hindered
											economic growth.
											You may say this is not fair,
											because I&#39;m selecting two countries
											to make a case against democracy.
											Actually, exactly the opposite
											is what I&#39;m going to do.
											I&#39;m going to use these two countries
											to make an economic argument for democracy,
											rather than against democracy.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The first question there
											is why China has grown so much faster
											than India.
											Over the last 30 years,
											in terms of the GDP growth rates,
											China has grown at twice the rate of India.
											In the last five years,
											the two countries have begun to converge somewhat
											in economic growth.
											But over the last 30 years,
											China undoubtedly
											has done much better than India.
											One simple answer
											is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai.
											Look at the skyline of Shanghai.
											This is the Pudong area.
											The picture on India
											is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai
											in India.
											The idea there
											behind these two pictures
											is that the Chinese government
											can act above rule of law.
											It can plan
											for the long-term benefits of the country
											and in the process,
											evict millions of people —
											that&#39;s just a small technical issue.
											Whereas in India, you cannot do that,
											because you have to listen to the public.
											You&#39;re being constrained by the public&#39;s opinion.
											Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
											agrees with that view.
											In an interview
											printed in the financial press of India,
											He said that he wants to make Mumbai
											another Shanghai.
											This is an Oxford-trained economist
											steeped in humanistic values,
											and yet he agrees
											with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth,
											that emphasizes the following features
											for promoting economic development:
											infrastructures, airports,
											highways, bridges, things like that.
											And you need a strong government to do that,
											because you cannot respect private property rights.
											You cannot be constrained by the public&#39;s opinion.
											You need also state ownership,
											especially of land assets,
											in order to build and roll out infrastructures
											very quickly.
											The implication of that model
											is that democracy
											is a hindrance for economic growth,
											rather than a facilitator of economic growth.
											Here&#39;s the key question.
											Just how important are infrastructures
											for economic growth?
											This is a key issue.
											If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth,
											then you would argue a strong government is necessary
											to promote growth.
											If you believe
											that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe,
											then you will put less emphasis
											on strong government.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So to illustrate that question,
											let me give you two countries.
											And for the sake of brevity,
											I&#39;ll call one country Country 1
											and the other country Country 2.
											Country 1
											has a systematic advantage over Country 2
											in infrastructures.
											Country 1 has more telephones,
											and Country 1 has a longer system of railways.
											So if I were to ask you,
											&quot;Which is China
											and which is India,
											and which country has grown faster?&quot;
											if you believe in the infrastructure view,
											then you will say, &quot;Country 1 must be China.
											They must have done better, in terms of economic growth.
											And Country 2 is possibly India.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Actually the country with more telephones
											is the Soviet Union,
											and the data referred to 1989.
											After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones,
											the country collapsed.
											That&#39;s not too good.
											The picture there is Khrushchev.
											I know that in 1989
											he no longer ruled the Soviet Union,
											but that&#39;s the best picture that I can find.
											(Laughter)
											Telephones, infrastructures
											do not guarantee you economic growth.
											Country 2, that has fewer telephones,
											is China.
											Since 1989,
											the country has performed at a double-digit rate
											every year for the last 20 years.
											If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union
											other than the fact about their telephones,
											you would have made a poor prediction
											about their economic growth
											in the next two decades.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Country 1, that has a longer system of railways,
											is actually India.
											And Country 2 is China.
											This is a very little known fact
											about the two countries.
											Yes, today China has a huge infrastructure advantage
											over India.
											But for many years,
											until the late 1990s,
											China had an infrastructure disadvantage
											vis-a-vis India.
											In developing countries,
											the most common mode of transportation
											is the railways,
											and the British built a lot of railways in India.
											India is the smaller of the two countries,
											and yet it had a longer system of railways
											until the late 1990s.
											So clearly,
											infrastructure doesn&#39;t explain
											why China did better before the late 1990s,
											as compared with India.

											In fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide,
											the evidence is more supportive of the view
											that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.
											The economy grows,
											government accumulates more resources,
											and the government can invest in infrastructure —
											rather than infrastructure being a cause
											for economic growth.
											And this is clearly the story
											of the Chinese economic growth.
											Let me look at this question more directly.
											Is democracy bad for economic growth?
											Now let&#39;s turn to two countries,
											Country A and Country B.
											Country A, in 1990,
											had about $300 per capita GDP
											as compared with Country B,
											which had $460 in per capita GDP.
											By 2008,
											Country A has surpassed Country B
											with $700 per capita GDP
											as compared with $650 per capita GDP.
											Both countries are in Asia.

											If I were to ask you,
											&quot;Which are the two Asian countries?
											And which one is a democracy?&quot;
											you may argue,
											&quot;Well, maybe Country A is China
											and Country B is India.&quot;
											In fact, Country A
											is democratic India,
											and Country B is Pakistan —
											the country that has a long period
											of military rule.
											And it&#39;s very common
											that we compare India with China.
											That&#39;s because the two countries
											have about the same population size.
											But the more natural comparison
											is actually between India and Pakistan.
											Those two countries are geographically similar.
											They have a complicated, but shared common history.
											By that comparison,
											democracy looks very, very good
											in terms of economic growth.

											So why do economists fall in love
											with authoritarian governments?
											One reason is the East Asian Model.
											In East Asia,
											we have had successful economic growth stories
											such as Korea, Taiwan,
											Hong Kong and Singapore.
											Some of these economies
											were ruled by authoritarian governments
											in the 60s and 70s
											and 1980s.
											The problem with that view
											is like asking all the winners of lotteries,
											&quot;Have you won the lottery?&quot;
											And they all tell you, &quot;Yes, we have won the lottery.&quot;
											And then you draw the conclusion
											the odds of winning the lottery
											are 100 percent.
											The reason is you never go
											and bother to ask the losers
											who also purchased lottery tickets
											and didn&#39;t end up winning the prize.

									<p>
											For each of these successful authoritarian governments
											in East Asia,
											there&#39;s a matched failure.
											Korea succeeded, North Korea didn&#39;t.
											Taiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn&#39;t.
											Burma didn&#39;t succeed.
											The Philippines didn&#39;t succeed.
											If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide,
											there&#39;s really no support for the idea
											that authoritarian governments
											hold a systematic edge over democracies
											in terms of economic growth.
											So the East Asian model
											has this massive selection bias —
											it is known as selecting on a dependent variable,
											something we always tell our students to avoid.

											So exactly why did China grow so much faster?
											I will take you to the Cultural Revolution,
											when China went mad,
											and compare that country&#39;s performance with India
											under Indira Gandhi.
											The question there is: Which country did better,
											China or India?
											China was during the Cultural Revolution.
											It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution,
											China out-perfomed India
											in terms of GDP growth
											by an average of about 2.2 percent every year
											in terms of per capita GDP.
											So that&#39;s when China was mad.
											The whole country went mad.
											It must mean that the country
											had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth
											to overcome the negative effects
											of the Cultural Revolution.
											The advantage the country had
											was human capital —
											nothing else but human capital.

											This is the world development index indicator data
											in the early 1990s.
											And this is the earliest data that I can find.
											The adult literacy rate in China
											is 77 percent
											as compared with 48 percent in India.
											The contrast in literacy rates
											is especially sharp
											between Chinese women and Indian women.
											I haven&#39;t told you about the definition of literacy.
											In China, the definition of literacy
											is the ability to read and write
											1,500 Chinese characters.
											In India, the definition of literacy,
											operating definition of literacy,
											is the ability, the grand ability,
											to write your own name
											in whatever language you happen to speak.
											The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy
											is much more substantial
											than the data here indicated.
											If you go to other sources of data
											such as Human Development Index,
											that data series,
											go back to the early 1970s,
											you see exactly the same contrast.
											China held a huge advantage
											in terms of human capital

											Life expectancies:
											as early as 1965,
											China had a huge advantage in life expectancy.
											On average, as a Chinese in 1965,
											you lived 10 years more
											than an average Indian.
											So if you have a choice
											between being a Chinese and being an Indian,
											you would want to become a Chinese
											in order to live 10 years longer.
											If you made that decision in 1965,
											the down side of that
											is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.
											So you have to always think carefully
											about these decisions.

											If you cannot chose your nationality,

											Because, as an Indian man,
											you have about two years of life expectancy advantage
											vis-a-vis Indian women.
											This is an extremely strange fact.
											It&#39;s very rare among countries
											to have this kind of pattern.
											It shows the systematic discrimination and biases
											in the Indian society
											against women.
											The good news is, by 2006,
											India has closed the gap
											between men and women
											in terms of life expectancy.
											Today, Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge
											over Indian men.
											So India is reverting to the normal.

											These are the two pictures
											taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province
											and garment factories in India.
											In China, it&#39;s all women.
											60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women
											in the coastal part of the country,
											whereas in India, it&#39;s all men.
											Financial Times printed this picture
											of an Indian textile factory
											with the title, &quot;India Poised to Overtake China in Textile.&quot;
											By looking at these two pictures,
											I say no, it won&#39;t overtake China for a while.
											If you look at other East Asian countries,
											women there play a hugely important role
											in terms of economic take-off —
											in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle
											associated with East Asia.
											India still has a long way to go
											to catch up with China.

											Then the issue is,
											what about the Chinese political system?
											You talk about human capital,
											you talk about education and public health.
											What about the political system?
											Isn&#39;t it true that the one-party political system
											has facilitated economic growth in China?
											Actually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that.
											It depends on a distinction that you draw
											between statics of the political system
											and the dynamics of the political system.
											Statically, China is a one-party system,
											authoritarian — there&#39;s no question about it.
											Dynamically, it has changed over time
											to become less authoritarian and more democratic.
											When you explain change —
											for example, economic growth;
											economic growth is about change —
											when you explain change,
											you use other things that have changed to explain change,
											rather than using the constant to explain change.
											Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change,
											but a fixed effect only explains changes
											in interaction with the things that change.

											In terms of the political changes,

											They have increased the security of proprietors.
											And they have increased the security

											There are also financial reforms in rural China.
											There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.
											To me, the pace of political changes
											is too slow, too gradual.
											And my own view is the country
											is going to face some substantial challenges,

											But nevertheless,

											You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.
											In fact, when India was growing
											at a Hindu rate of growth —
											about one percent, two percent a year —
											that was when India was least democratic.
											Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.
											The Indian government owned and operated
											all the TV stations.
											A little-known fact about India in the 1990s
											is that the country
											not only has undertaken economic reforms,
											the country has also undertaken political reforms
											by introducing village self-rule,
											privatization of media
											and introducing freedom of information acts.
											So the dynamic perspective
											fits both with China and in India

											Why do many people believe
											that India is still a growth disaster?
											One reason
											is they are always comparing India with China.
											But China is a superstar
											in terms of economic growth.
											If you are a NBA player
											and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan,
											you&#39;re going to look not so impressive.
											But that doesn&#39;t mean
											that you&#39;re a bad basketball player.
											Comparing with a superstar
											is the wrong benchmark.
											In fact, if you compare India
											with the average developing country,
											even before the more recent period
											of acceleration of Indian growth —
											now India is growing between eight and nine percent —
											even before this period,
											India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth
											among emerging economies.
											This is a very impressive record indeed.

											Let&#39;s think about the future:

											Which country has the growth momentum?
											China, I believe, still has
											some of the excellent raw fundamentals —
											mostly the social capital,
											the public health,
											the sense of egalitarianism
											that you don&#39;t find in India.
											But I believe that India has the momentum.
											It has the improving fundamentals.
											The government has invested in basic education,
											has invested in basic health.
											I believe the government should do more,
											but nevertheless, the direction it is moving in
											is the right direction.

Lately he’s been asking, Does democracy hinder or promote economic growth?","whylisten":"<p>MIT and Fudan University professor Yasheng Huang is an authority on how to get ahead in emerging economies. The China and India Labs he founded at MIT&#39;s Sloan School of Management specialize in helping local startups improve their strategies. His book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/chinesecapitalism\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics</em></a>&nbsp;(2008) chronicles three decades of economic reform in China and documents the critical role that private entrepreneurship played in the Communist nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;economic miracle.&rdquo; <br /><br />Huang believes that China is moving away from Marxism (public ownership) but not Leninism (ideology of state control) -- and that strong social fundamentals are the key reason for its growth. He is a vocal critic of US foreign policy in China, calling on American leaders to rethink their messages, which often do not resonate with the Chinese public, and to use technology to broaden their reach, overcome stereotypes and quash conspiracy theories. He says: &quot;For too long the US has not paid attention to an important force in the Chinese economy: the rise of indigenous entrepreneurs. This is in sharp contrast to the US approach in India.&quot; </p><p>In early 2013 Huang <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138477/yasheng-huang/democratize-or-die\" target=\"_blank\">sparred with Eric X.
