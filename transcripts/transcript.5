											I&#39;m not exaggerating. I do weekends —
											I do more, obviously,
I also coach people —
											but I&#39;m into immersion,
because how did you learn language?
											Not just by learning principles,
											you got in it and you did it

											The bottom line of why I&#39;m here,

											Often that&#39;s what people think I do,
											and it&#39;s the furthest thing from it.
											What happens, though, is people say to me,
											&quot;I don&#39;t need any motivation.&quot;
											But that&#39;s not what I do.

											What is your motive for action?
											What is it that drives you
in your life today? Not 10 years ago.
											Are you running the same pattern?
											Because I believe that the invisible force
of internal drive, activated,
											is the most important thing.
											I&#39;m here because I believe
emotion is the force of life.
											All of us here have great minds.
											Most of us here have great minds, right?
											We all know how to think.
											With our minds we can
rationalize anything.
											We can make anything happen.

											I agree with what was described
a few days ago,
											that people work in their self-interest.
											But we know that that&#39;s bullshit at times.
											You don&#39;t work in your
self-interest all the time,
											because when emotion comes into it,
											the wiring changes
in the way it functions.
											So it&#39;s wonderful to think intellectually
about how the life of the world is,
											especially those who are very smart
can play this game in our head.
											But I really want to know
what&#39;s driving you.

where you are today, for two reasons.
											One: so that you can contribute more.
											And two: that hopefully we can not just
understand other people more,
											but appreciate them more,
and create the kinds of connections
											that can stop some of the challenges
that we face today.
											They&#39;re only going to get magnified
by the very technology that connects us,
											because it&#39;s making us intersect.
											That intersection
doesn&#39;t always create a view
											of &quot;everybody now understands everybody,

											I&#39;ve had an obsession
basically for 30 years,
											&quot;What makes the difference
in the quality of people&#39;s lives?
											What in their performance?&quot;
											I got hired to produce the result now.
											I&#39;ve done it for 30 years.
											I get the phone call
											when the athlete is burning down
on national television,
											and they were ahead by five strokes
											and now they can&#39;t get back on the course.
											I&#39;ve got to do something right now
or nothing matters.
											I get the phone call when the child
is going to commit suicide,
											I&#39;ve got to do something.
											In 29 years, I&#39;m very grateful
to tell you I&#39;ve never lost one.
											It doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t some day,
but I haven&#39;t yet.
											The reason is an understanding
of these human needs.

											When I get those calls
about performance, that&#39;s one thing.
											How do you make a change?
											I&#39;m also looking to see what is shaping
the person&#39;s ability to contribute,
											to do something beyond themselves.
											Maybe the real question is,
											I look at life and say
there&#39;s two master lessons.
											One is: there&#39;s the science
of achievement,
											which almost everyone here
has mastered amazingly.
											&quot;How do you take the invisible
and make it visible,&quot;
											How do you make your dreams happen?
											Your business, your contribution
to society, money —
											whatever, your body, your family.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The other lesson that is rarely
mastered is the art of fulfillment.
											Because science is easy, right?
											We know the rules, you write the code
and you get the results.
											Once you know the game,
you just up the ante, don&#39;t you?
											But when it comes
to fulfillment — that&#39;s an art.
											The reason is, it&#39;s about
appreciation and contribution.
											You can only feel so much by yourself.

											I&#39;ve had an interesting laboratory
to try to answer the real question
											how somebody&#39;s life changes
											if you look at them like those people
that you&#39;ve given everything to?
											Like all the resources they say they need.
											You gave not a 100-dollar computer,
but the best computer.
											You gave them love, joy,
were there to comfort them.
											Those people very often —
you know some of them —
											end up the rest of their life
											with all this love, education,
money and background
											going in and out of rehab.
											Some people have been
through ultimate pain,
											psychologically, sexually,
spiritually, emotionally abused —
											and not always, but often,
											they become some of the people
that contribute the most to society.

											The question we&#39;ve got to ask
ourselves really is, what is it?
											What is it that shapes us?
											We live in a therapy culture.
											Most of us don&#39;t do that,
but the culture&#39;s a therapy culture,
											the mindset that we are our past.
											And you wouldn&#39;t be in this room
if you bought that,
											but most of society
thinks biography is destiny.
											The past equals the future.
											Of course it does if you live there.

we have to remind ourselves —

Give up? Smoke a cigarette?

certain, ironically,

											Third human need, critical: significance.
											We all need to feel important,
special, unique.
											You can get it by making more money
or being more spiritual.
											You can do it by getting yourself
in a situation where you put
											more tattoos and earrings in places
humans don&#39;t want to know.
											Whatever it takes.
											The fastest way to do this,
											if you have no background,
no culture, no belief and resources
											or resourcefulness, is violence.
											If I put a gun to your head and I live
in the &#39;hood, instantly I&#39;m significant.
											Zero to 10. How high? 10.
											How certain am I that
you&#39;re going to respond to me? 10.
											How much uncertainty?
											Who knows what&#39;s going to happen next?
Kind of exciting.
											Like climbing up into a cave
and doing that stuff
											all the way down there.
											Total variety and uncertainty.
											And it&#39;s significant, isn&#39;t it?
So you want to risk your life for it.
											So that&#39;s why violence has always
been around and will be around
											unless we have a consciousness
change as a species.
											You can get significance a million ways,
											but to be significant, you&#39;ve got
to be unique and different.

intimacy, friendship, prayer,
											through walking in nature.

the needs of the personality.

is not growing,
											if you&#39;re not growing,

											My life was touched
because when I was 11 years old,
											Thanksgiving, no money, no food,
											we were not going to starve,
											but my father was totally messed up,
											my mom was letting him know
how bad he messed up,
											and somebody came to the door
and delivered food.
											My father made three decisions,
I know what they were, briefly.
											His focus was &quot;This is charity.
											What does it mean? I&#39;m worthless.
											What do I have to do?
Leave my family,&quot; which he did.
											It was one of the most painful
experiences of life.
											My three decisions
gave me a different path.

											And now somebody I don&#39;t know,
											they&#39;re not asking for anything,
just giving us food,
											looking out for us.
											It made me believe this:
that strangers care.
											And that made me decide,

I care about them.
											I&#39;m going to do something
to make a difference.
											So when I was 17,
I went out on Thanksgiving,
											it was my target for years to have
enough money to feed two families.

I ever did in my life.

											So, finally — I&#39;m about out of time.
											The target that shapes you —
											Here&#39;s what&#39;s different about people.
											We have the same needs.
											But are you a certainty freak,
is that what you value most,
											or uncertainty?
											This man couldn&#39;t be a certainty freak
if he climbed through those caves.
											Are you driven by significance or love?
											We all need all six,
											but what your lead system is
tilts you in a different direction.
											And as you move in a direction,
you have a destination or destiny.
											The second piece is the map.
											The operating system
tells you how to get there,
											and some people&#39;s map is,
											&quot;I&#39;m going to save lives
even if I die for other people,&quot;
											and they&#39;re a fireman,
											and somebody else says,
&quot;I&#39;m going to kill people to do it.&quot;
											They&#39;re trying to meet
the same needs of significance.
											They want to honor God
or honor their family.
											But they have a different map.

									<p>
											And there are seven different beliefs;
I can&#39;t go through them, because I&#39;m done.
											The last piece is emotion.
											One of the parts of the map is like time.
											Some people&#39;s idea
of a long time is 100 years.
											Somebody else&#39;s is three seconds,
which is what I have.
											And the last one I&#39;ve already mentioned
that fell to you.
											If you&#39;ve got a target and a map —
											I can&#39;t use Google because I love Macs,
											and they haven&#39;t made it
good for Macs yet.
											So if you use MapQuest —
											how many have made
this fatal mistake of using it?
											You use this thing
and you don&#39;t get there.
											Imagine if your beliefs guarantee
you can never get to where you want to go.

they write empowering emotions,
											the other&#39;s disempowering,
											guess how many emotions
they experience? Less than 12.

make them feel like shit.

											Happy, happy, excited, oh shit,
											frustrated, frustrated,
overwhelmed, depressed.

What&#39;s less known about the iconic motivational speaker is <strong>the range and stature of his personal clients. From CEOs to heads of state to Olympic athletes</strong>, a wide swath of high-performing professionals (who are already plenty motivated, thank you very much) look to him for help reaching their full potential.<br /><br />Robbins&#39; expertise in leadership psychology is what brought him to TED, where his spontaneous on-stage interaction with Al Gore created an unforgettable TED moment. It also perfectly demonstrated Robbins&#39; direct -- even confrontational -- approach, which calls on his listeners to look within themselves, and <strong>find the inner blocks that prevent them from finding fulfillment and success</strong>. Some of his techniques -- firewalking, for example -- are magnets for criticism, but his underlying message is unassailable: We all have the ability to make a positive impact on the world, and it&#39;s up to us, as individuals, to overcome our fears and foibles to reach that potential.<br /><br />Robbins has won many accolades for his work -- including <strong>his memorable performance in the Jack Black comedy </strong><em><strong>Shallow Hal</strong>.</em> (It was a small but vital role.) His <a href=\"http://www.anthonyrobbinsfoundation.org/arf/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Robbins Foundation</a>  works with the homeless, elderly and inner-city youth, and feeds more than 2
