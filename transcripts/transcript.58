											So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,
											&quot;If you say a word often enough, it becomes you.&quot;
											And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,
											I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder —
											thank God for technology —
											to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words —
											which is also why I don&#39;t wear shoes when I perform —
											if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.
											I was also inspired by Walt Whitman,
											who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.

											So these four characters are going to be from that work
											that I&#39;ve been doing for many years now,
											and well over, I don&#39;t know, a couple of thousand people
											I&#39;ve interviewed.
											Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?
											So I thought he would be the perfect person
											to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.
											You know, he was &quot;born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,
											greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,
											and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century.&quot;

											So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.
											&quot;Defining moment in American history, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one;
											you can&#39;t say Hiroshima, that&#39;s a big one —
											I can&#39;t think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.
											The gradual slippage — &#39;slippage&#39; is the word
											used by the people in Watergate, moral slippage —
											it&#39;s a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.
											You see, we also have the technology.
											I say, less and less the human touch.

											&quot;Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.
											The Atlanta airport is a modern airport,
											and they should leave the gate there.
											These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.
											And these trains are smooth,
											and they&#39;re quiet and they&#39;re efficient.
											And there&#39;s a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.
											You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.
											Now we have humans imitating robots.
											So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.
											Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.
											Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in
											and they&#39;re just about to close the pneumatic doors.
											And that voice, without losing a beat, says,
											&#39;Because of late entry, we&#39;re delayed 30 seconds.&#39;
											Just then, everybody&#39;s looking at this couple with hateful eyes
											and the couple&#39;s going like this, you know, shrinking.
											Well, I&#39;d happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding —
											I do that to steel my nerves — and so
											I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my —
											&#39;George Orwell, your time has come,&#39; you see.
											Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs
											when I say that, but not on this train. Silence.
											And so suddenly they&#39;re looking at me.
											So here I am with the couple, the three of us
											shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.

											&quot;Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.
											I know it&#39;s Hispanic because she&#39;s speaking Spanish to her companion.
											So I&#39;m going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,
											holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,
											I say to the baby, &#39;Sir or Madam,
											what is your considered opinion of the human species?&#39;
											And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,
											starts laughing,
											starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.
											I say, &#39;Thank God for a human reaction, we haven&#39;t lost yet.&#39;

											&quot;But you see, the human touch, you see, it&#39;s disappearing.
											You know, you see, you&#39;ve got to question the official truth.
											You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain —
											you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don&#39;t read him.
											We read &#39;Huck Finn,&#39; of course, we read &#39;Huck Finn&#39; of course.
											I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.
											Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?
											You see, here&#39;s Huck; he&#39;s an illiterate kid; he&#39;s had no schooling,
											but there&#39;s something in him.
											And the official truth, the truth was, the law was,
											that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.

											And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.
											And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids
											and steal them from the woman who owns them,
											and Huck says, &#39;Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh —
											that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.
											Ooh, he&#39;s going to steal; he&#39;s going to steal;
											he&#39;s going to do a terrible thing.&#39;
											Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.
											&#39;Anybody up on that raft with you?&#39; Huck says, &#39;Yeah.&#39;

											So, talk about risk taking. I&#39;m going to do somebody that nobody likes.
											You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable —

											I like to inspire people.
											But since this was called &quot;risk taking,&quot;
											I&#39;m doing somebody who I never do, because she&#39;s so unlikeable

											Maxine Greene, who&#39;s a wonderful philosopher
											who&#39;s as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy —
											great, big philosophy kind of an organization —
											I went to her and asked her what are the two things
											that she doesn&#39;t know, that she still wants to know.
											And she said, &quot;Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey
											when I see the president of my university.
											And I still feel as though I&#39;ve got to get coffee
											for my male colleagues, even though I&#39;ve outlived most of them.&quot;
											And she said, &quot;And then intellectually,
											I don&#39;t know enough about the negative imagination.

											When I started this project

											And so I went to both — two race riots,

											They did not, so there were riots.
											And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,
											ordered by George Bush, Sr.
											And that trial came back with two cops going to jail
											and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.

											&#39;Well, finally justice has been done in this society.&#39;
											Well, what about victims&#39; rights?
