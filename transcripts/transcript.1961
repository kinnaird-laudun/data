<title>Jon Ronson: When online shaming goes too far | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Twitter gives a voice to the voiceless, a way to speak up and hit back at perceived injustice. But sometimes, says Jon Ronson, things go too far. In a jaw-dropping story of how one un-funny tweet ruined a woman&#39;s life and career, Ronson shows how online commenters can end up behaving like a baying mob -- and says it&#39;s time to rethink how we interact online." />

<meta content="Twitter gives a voice to the voiceless, a way to speak up and hit back at perceived injustice. But sometimes, says Jon Ronson, things go too far. In a jaw-dropping story of how one un-funny tweet ruined a woman's life and career, Ronson shows how online commenters can end up behaving like a baying mob — and says it's time to rethink how we interact online." itemprop='description'>

											In the early days of Twitter,
it was like a place of radical de-shaming.
											People would admit
shameful secrets about themselves,
											and other people would say,
&quot;Oh my God, I&#39;m exactly the same.&quot;
											Voiceless people realized
that they had a voice,
											and it was powerful and eloquent.
											If a newspaper ran some racist
or homophobic column,
											we realized we could do
something about it.
											We could get them.
											We could hit them with a weapon
that we understood but they didn&#39;t —
											a social media shaming.
											Advertisers would withdraw
their advertising.
											When powerful people
misused their privilege,
											we were going to get them.
											This was like the
democratization of justice.
											Hierarchies were being leveled out.
											We were going to do things better.

											Soon after that, a disgraced
pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer —
											he&#39;d been caught plagiarizing
and faking quotes,
											and he was drenched in shame
and regret, he told me.
											And he had the opportunity
											to publicly apologize
at a foundation lunch.
											This was going to be the most
important speech of his life.
											Maybe it would win him some salvation.
											He knew before he arrived
											that the foundation was going to be
live-streaming his event,
											but what he didn&#39;t know
until he turned up,
											was that they&#39;d erected a giant screen
Twitter feed right next to his head.
											(Laughter)
											Another one in a monitor screen
in his eye line.

horrific reality.

											Let me tell you a story.
											It&#39;s about a woman called Justine Sacco.
											She was a PR woman from New York
with 170 Twitter followers,
											and she&#39;d Tweet little
acerbic jokes to them,
											like this one on a plane
from New York to London:
											[Weird German Dude: You&#39;re in first class.
It&#39;s 2014. Get some deodorant.&quot;
											-Inner monologue as inhale BO.
Thank god for pharmaceuticals.]
											So Justine chuckled to herself,
and pressed send, and got no replies,
											and felt that sad feeling that we all feel
											when the Internet doesn&#39;t
congratulate us for being funny.
											(Laughter)
											Black silence when the Internet
doesn&#39;t talk back.
											And then she got to Heathrow,
and she had a little time to spare
											before her final leg, so she thought up
another funny little acerbic joke:

got on the plane, got no replies,
											turned off her phone, fell asleep,
											woke up 11 hours later,
											turned on her phone while the plane
was taxiing on the runway,
											and straightaway there was
a message from somebody
											that she hadn&#39;t spoken
to since high school,
											that said, &quot;I am so sorry
to see what&#39;s happening to you.&quot;
											And then another message
from a best friend,

											And I sat up in my bed,
											and I put the pillow behind my head,

that joke was intended to be racist.
											Maybe instead of gleefully
flaunting her privilege,
											she was mocking the gleeful
flaunting of privilege.
											There&#39;s a comedy tradition of this,
											like South Park or Colbert
or Randy Newman.
											Maybe Justine Sacco&#39;s crime was not being
as good at it as Randy Newman.
											In fact, when I met Justine
a couple of weeks later in a bar,

											JR: Yeah. This happened last night.
We had like a TED dinner last night.
											We were chatting and it was lovely
and nice, and I decided to check Twitter.
											Somebody said, &quot;You are
a white supremacist.&quot;
											And then I went back and had
a nice conversation with somebody,
											and then I went back to Twitter,
											somebody said my very existence
made the world a worse place.
											My friend Adam Curtis says
											that maybe the Internet is like
a John Carpenter movie from the 1980s,
											when eventually everyone
will start screaming at each other
											and shooting each other,
and then eventually everybody
											would flee to somewhere safer,
											and I&#39;m starting to think of that
as a really nice option.
