											My thing with school lunch is, it&#39;s a social justice issue.
											I&#39;m the Director of Nutrition Services
											for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees
											and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.
											I&#39;m doing 7,100 meals a day
											and I&#39;ve been doing it for two years,
											trying to change how we feed kids in America.
											And that&#39;s what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.
											These are some of my kids with a salad bar.
											I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.
											Everyone says it couldn&#39;t be done.
											Little kids couldn&#39;t eat off the salad bar,
											big kids would spit in it — neither happened.

											When I took over this, I tried to really figure out,
											like, what my vision would be.
											How do we really change children&#39;s relationship to food?
											And I&#39;ll tell you why we need to change it,
											but we absolutely have to change it.
											And what I came to understand is,
											we needed to teach children
											the symbiotic relationship
											between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.
											And that if we don&#39;t do that, the antithesis,
											although we&#39;ve heard otherwise,
											is we&#39;re really going to become extinct,
											because we&#39;re feeding our children to death.
											That&#39;s my premise.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We&#39;re seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.
											And the reason this is happening, by and large,
											is because of our food system
											and the way the government commodifies food,
											the way the government oversees our food,
											the way the USDA puts food on kids&#39; plates
											that&#39;s unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.
											And by — tacitly, all of us send our kids,
											or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school
											and tell them to learn, you know,
											learn what&#39;s in those schools.
											And when you feed these kids bad food,
											that&#39;s what they&#39;re learning. So that&#39;s really what this is all about.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The way we got here is because of big agribusiness.
											We now live in a country where most of us don&#39;t decide,
											by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,
											who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.
											They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.
											These are — 10 companies
											control much of what&#39;s in our grocery stores,
											much of what people eat. And that&#39;s really, really a problem.

									<p>
											So when I started thinking about these issues
											and how I was going to change what kids ate,
											I really started focusing on what we would teach them.
											And the very first thing
											was about regional food — trying to eat food
											from within our region.
											And clearly, with what&#39;s going on with fossil fuel usage,
											or when — as the fossil fuel is going away,
											as oil hits its peak oil,
											you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not
											we should, or could, be moving food
											1,500 miles before we eat it.
											So we talked to kids about that,
											and we really start to feed kids regional food.

									<p>
											And then we talk about organic food.
											Now, most school districts can&#39;t really afford organic food,
											but we, as a nation,
											have to start thinking about
											consuming, growing and feeding our children
											food that&#39;s not chock-full of chemicals.
											We can&#39;t keep feeding our kids pesticides
											and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.
											We can&#39;t keep doing that.
											You know, it doesn&#39;t work.
											And the results of that are kids getting sick.

									<p>
											One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.
											Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America
											is consumed in animal husbandry.
											We are feeding our kids antibiotics
											in beef and other animal protein every day.
											Seventy percent — it&#39;s unbelievable.
											And the result of it is, we have diseases.
											We have things like E. coli that we can&#39;t fix,
											that we can&#39;t make kids better when they get sick.
											And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,
											but it&#39;s an issue in the food supply.
											One of my favorite facts is that
											U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.
											That means every one of us, and our children,
											consumes what would equal a five-pound bag —
											those bags you have at home. If I had one here
											and ripped it open,
											and that pile I would have on the floor
											is what we consume and feed our children every year
											because of what goes into our food supply,
											because of the way we consume
											produce in America.

											The USDA allows these antibiotics,

											And it&#39;s because of what we feed them.

											Now one of the things that — what happened when I went into Berkeley

											The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.
											We have to start changing this.
											We have to make kids understand
											that their food choices make a big difference.
											We have cooking classes — we have cooking classrooms in our schools.
											And why this is so important is
											that we now have grown a generation,
											maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals
											is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car
											and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.

											We have to teach kids that if they&#39;re on a diet

											One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships.
											I work with private companies
											who are willing to do R &amp; D with me,
											who are willing to do distribution for me,
											who are really willing to work to go into schools.
											Schools are underfunded.
											Most schools in America spend less

											That comes down to under five dollars an hour.
											Most of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour
											for babysitters when you have them.
											So we&#39;re spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.
											And if we&#39;re going to change it,
											and change how we feed kids,
											we really have to rethink that.
											So, public and private partnerships,
											advocacy groups, working with foundations.
											In our school district, the way we afford this
											is our school district allocates .03 percent
											of the general fund
											towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district
											allocated a half to one percent,
											we could start to really fix this program.

											It&#39;s going to take more money.

											And one of the simple things we can do
											is put recess before lunch.
											It&#39;s sort of this &quot;duh&quot; thing.
											You know, if you have kids coming into lunch
											and all they&#39;re going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess,
											you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.
											And then, at one in the afternoon, they&#39;re totally crashing.
											These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down
											when you pick them up, because they haven&#39;t had lunch.

											Two were supposed to be cooks — none could.

											We have to get academic institutions to start thinking

											Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA,

											Okay, Finance 101 on this,

											The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars
											feeding 30 million children a year.
											That number probably needs to double.
											People say, &quot;Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?&quot;
											In this country, we&#39;re spending 110 billion dollars a year
											on fast food.
											We spend 100 billion dollars a year
											on diet aids.
											We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables,
											which is why we need all the diet aids.
											We spend 200 billion dollars a year

											So you know what, when we talk
											about needing 8 billion more, it&#39;s not a lot.
											That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents —
											that&#39;s what the government allocates for lunch.
											Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.
											That means we spend less than a dollar a day
											on food for kids in schools —
											most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it&#39;s 56 cents.
											So we&#39;re spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch.
											Now I don&#39;t know about you,
											but I go to Starbucks and Pete&#39;s and places like that,
											and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars.
