											I have, like, a thing about sleeping.
											I don&#39;t sleep that much,
											and I&#39;ve come to this thing about, like, not sleeping much
											as being a great virtue, after years of kind of
											battling it as being a terrible detriment, or something.
											And now I really like sort of sitting up, you know.
											But for years I&#39;ve been sitting up
											and I think that, like, my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia.
											I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly.
											Sometimes I used to walk more at night.
											I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.
											(Laughter)

											And sometimes — actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post,
											that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever,
											but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on.
											And so I was following this guy.
											And I took a picture of his shoes,
											and we thanked each other and just went on our way.
											But I do that all the time.
											As a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design ideas
											come from mistakes and tricks of the eye.
											Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there,
											so many clothes out there.
											And the only ones that look interesting to me
											are the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course,
											or very, very surprising.
											And often, I&#39;m driving in a taxi
											and I see a hole in a shirt, or something
											that looks very interesting or pretty or functional
											in some way that I&#39;d never seen happen before.
											And so I&#39;d make the car stop, and I&#39;d get out of the car and walk,
											and see that in fact there wasn&#39;t a hole, but it was a trick of my eye,
											it was a shadow, you know.
											Or if there was a hole I&#39;d think like, oh damn,
											there was actually someone thought of that thought already.
											Someone made that mistake already so I can&#39;t do it anymore.

											I don&#39;t know where inspiration comes from.
											It does not come for me from research.
											I don&#39;t get necessarily inspired by research.
											As a matter of fact, one of the most fun things
											I&#39;ve ever, ever done in my whole life,
											was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York.
											I read &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; with this beautiful band from Juilliard.
											And I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.
											And I saw this really smart critic who I love.
											This woman, Joan Acocella, who&#39;s a friend of mine,
											and she came backstage and she said,
											oh, you know, Isaac, did you know that, talking about Stalinism
											and talking about, you know, like the &#39;30s in Russia.
											And I said, how do I know about Stalinism?
											I know about a wolf and a bird and, you know,
											he ate the bird, and then in the end you hear, you know,
											you hear the bird squeaking, or something, you know?

									<p>
											So I don&#39;t really know that. I don&#39;t really —
											actually I do my own kind of research, you know.
											If I&#39;m commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that,
											I will do a lot of research, because it&#39;s interesting,
											not because it&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to do.
											I&#39;m very, very, very inspired by movies.
											The color of movies and the way light makes the colors,
											light from behind the projection,
											or light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible.
											And anyway, roll this little clip, I&#39;ll just show you.
											I sit up at night and I watch movies
											and I watch women in movies a lot.
											And I think about, you know, their roles,
											and about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.
											Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time.
											Whether they&#39;re kind of glorified in this way,
											or whether they&#39;re kind of, you know, ironically glorified,
											or whether they&#39;re, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated.

											I go back to color all the time.
											Color is something that motivates me a lot.
											It&#39;s rarely color that I find in nature,
											although, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color,
											natural color is so beautiful.
											So that&#39;s what I do. I study color a lot.
											But for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything
											that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?
											How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?
											I mean, that&#39;s just not possible, you know.
											And so that&#39;s what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know.
											I want to show you — I&#39;m also like a big —
											I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often,
											and that&#39;s another thing that motivates me a lot.
											People say, oh, do that. An astrologer tells me to do something.
											So I do it.

											When I was about 21, an astrologer told me
											that I was going to meet the man of my dreams,
											and that his name was going to be Eric, right?
											So, you know, for years I would go to bars
											and, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric
											I was humping immediately, or something.
											(Laughter)
											And there were times when I was actually so desperate
											I would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, &quot;Eric!&quot;
											And anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for.
											(Laughter)
											And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.
											The last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny
											was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane
											and you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right?
											I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing

											The name of the show is based on this story

											It&#39;s sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.
											I was dating this guy, right?

											I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year, right.
											And we were getting serious,
											so we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.
											And we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other.
											My mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother,
											who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing.
											You know, homosexuality, right?
											So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said,
											&quot;Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together.
											They eat out, they see shows.&quot;
											They eat out, they see shows.

											And at least, you know, in my case,

											And you know, I don&#39;t say that I do everything well,
