<title>Scott Fraser: Why eyewitnesses get it wrong | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Scott Fraser studies how humans remember crimes -- and bear witness to them. In this powerful talk, which focuses on a deadly shooting at sunset, he suggests that even close-up eyewitnesses to a crime can create &quot;memories&quot; they could not have seen. Why? Because the brain abhors a vacuum. Editor&#39;s note: In the original version of this talk, Scott Fraser misspoke about available footage of Two World Trade Center (Tower 2). The misstatement has been edited out for clarity." />

<meta content='Why eyewitnesses get it wrong' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Scott Fraser studies how humans remember crimes — and bear witness to them. In this powerful talk, which focuses on a deadly shooting at sunset, he suggests that even close-up eyewitnesses to a crime can create "memories" they could not have seen. Why? Because the brain abhors a vacuum. Editor&#x0027;s note: In the original version of this talk, Scott Fraser misspoke about available footage of Two World Trade Center (Tower 2). The misstatement has been edited out for clarity.' itemprop='description'>

											The murder happened a little over 21 years ago,
											January the 18th, 1991,
											in a small
											bedroom community
											of Lynwood, California, just a few miles
											southeast of Los Angeles.
											A father came out of his house
											to tell his teenage son and his five friends
											that it was time for them to stop horsing around
											on the front lawn and on the sidewalk,
											to get home, finish their schoolwork,
											and prepare themselves for bed.
											And as the father was administering these instructions,
											a car drove by, slowly,
											and just after it passed the father and the teenagers,
											a hand went out from the front passenger window,
											and — &quot;Bam, Bam!&quot; — killing the father.
											And the car sped off.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The police,
											investigating officers, were amazingly efficient.
											They considered all the usual culprits,
											and in less than 24 hours, they had selected their suspect:
											Francisco Carrillo, a 17-year-old kid
											who lived about two or three blocks away
											from where the shooting occurred.
											They found photos of him. They prepared a photo array,
											and the day after the shooting,
											they showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said,
											&quot;That&#39;s the picture.
											That&#39;s the shooter I saw that killed the father.&quot;
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That was all a preliminary hearing judge had
											to listen to, to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial
											for a first-degree murder.
											In the investigation that followed before the actual trial,
											each of the other five teenagers was shown
											photographs, the same photo array.
											The picture that we best can determine was probably
											the one that they were shown in the photo array
											is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots.
											The reason we&#39;re not sure absolutely is because
											of the nature of evidence preservation
											in our judicial system,
											but that&#39;s another whole TEDx talk for later. (Laughter)

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So at the actual trial,
											all six of the teenagers testified,
											and indicated the identifications they had made
											in the photo array.
											He was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment,
											and transported to Folsom Prison.

									<p>
											So what&#39;s wrong?
											Straightforward, fair trial, full investigation.
											Oh yes, no gun was ever found.
											No vehicle was ever identified as being the one
											in which the shooter had extended his arm,
											and no person was ever charged with being the driver
											of the shooter&#39;s vehicle.
											And Mr. Carrillo&#39;s alibi?
											Which of those parents here in the room might not lie
											concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter
											in an investigation of a killing?

											So what&#39;s the problem?
											The problems, actually, for this kind of case
											come manyfold from decades of scientific research
											involving human memory.
											First of all, we have all the statistical analyses
											from the Innocence Project work,
											where we know that we have, what,
											250, 280 documented cases now where people have
											been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated,
											some from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis,
											and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases

											The other comes from an interesting aspect
											of human memory that&#39;s related to various brain functions
											but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here
											in a simple line:
											The brain abhors a vacuum.
											Under the best of observation conditions,
											the absolute best,
											we only detect, encode and store in our brains
											bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us,
											and they&#39;re stored in different parts of the brain.
											So now, when it&#39;s important for us to be able to recall
											what it was that we experienced,
											we have an incomplete, we have a partial store,
											and what happens?
											Below awareness, with no requirement for any kind of
											motivated processing, the brain fills in information
											that was not there,
											not originally stored,
											from inference, from speculation,
											from sources of information that came to you,
											as the observer, after the observation.
											But it happens without awareness such that
											you don&#39;t, aren&#39;t even cognizant of it occurring.
											It&#39;s called reconstructed memories.
											It happens to us in all the aspects of our life, all the time.
											It was those two considerations, among others —
											reconstructed memory, the fact about the eyewitness fallibility —
											that was part of the instigation
											for a group of appeal attorneys
											led by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers
											to pool their experience and their talents together
											and petition a superior court
											for a retrial for Francisco Carrillo.
											They retained me, as a forensic neurophysiologist,
											because I had expertise
											in eyewitness memory identification,
											which obviously makes sense for this case, right?
											But also because I have expertise and testify about
											the nature of human night vision.

									<p>
											Well, what&#39;s that got to do with this?
											Well, when you read through the case materials
											in this Carrillo case,
											one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that
											the investigating officers said the lighting was good
											at the crime scene, at the shooting.
											All the teenagers testified during the trial
											that they could see very well.
											But this occurred in mid-January,
											in the Northern Hemisphere, at 7 p.m. at night.
											So when I did the calculations
											for the lunar data and the solar data
											at that location on Earth at the time of the incident
											of the shooting, all right,
											it was well past the end of civil twilight
											and there was no moon up that night.
											So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon
											is what you see on the screen right here.
											The only lighting in that area had to come
											from artificial sources,
											and that&#39;s where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction
											of the scene with photometers, with various measures
											of illumination and various other measures of
											color perception, along with special cameras
											and high-speed film, right?
											Take all the measurements and record them, right?
											And then take photographs, and this is what the scene
											looked like at the time of the shooting
											from the position of the teenagers
											looking at the car going by and shooting.
											This is looking directly across the street
											from where they were standing.
											Remember, the investigating officers&#39; report said
											the lighting was good.
											The teenagers said they could see very well.
											This is looking down to the east,
											where the shooting vehicle sped off,
											and this is the lighting directly behind the father
											and the teenagers.
											As you can see, it is at best poor.
											No one&#39;s going to call this well-lit, good lighting,
											and in fact, as nice as these pictures are,
											and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court,
											and a picture is worth more than a thousand words
											when you&#39;re trying to communicate numbers,
											abstract concepts like lux, the international measurement
											of illumination, the Ishihara color perception test values.
											When you present those to people who are not well-versed
											in those aspects of science and that, they become
											salamanders in the noonday sun. It&#39;s like
											talking about the tangent of the visual angle, all right?
											Their eyes just glaze over, all right?
											A good forensic expert also has to be a good educator,
											a good communicator, and that&#39;s part of the reason
											why we take the pictures, to show not only
											where the light sources are, and what we call the spill,
											the distribution, but also so that it&#39;s easier
											for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances.
											So these are some of the pictures that, in fact,
											I used when I testified,
											but more importantly were, to me as a scientist,
											are those readings, the photometer readings,
											which I can then convert into actual predictions
											of the visual capability of the human eye
											under those circumstances,
											and from my readings that I recorded at the scene
											under the same solar and lunar conditions
											at the same time, so on and so forth, right,
											I could predict
											that there would be no reliable color perception,
											which is crucial for face recognition,
											and that there would be only scotopic vision,
											which means there would be very little resolution,
											what we call boundary or edge detection,
											and that furthermore, because the eyes would have been
											totally dilated under this light, the depth of field,
											the distance at which you can focus and see details,
											would have been less than 18 inches away.

											We had him stand actually slightly in the street,

											so he stood a few feet from the curb

											We had a car that came by,

											First of all, there&#39;s a long history of antipathy
											between science and the law
											in American jurisprudence.
											I could regale you with horror stories of ignorance
											over decades of experience as a forensic expert
											of just trying to get science into the courtroom.
											The opposing council always fight it and oppose it.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											One suggestion is that all of us become much more
											attuned to the necessity, through policy,
											through procedures,
											to get more science in the courtroom,
											and I think one large step toward that
											is more requirements,
											with all due respect to the law schools,
											of science, technology, engineering, mathematics
											for anyone going into the law,
											because they become the judges.
											Think about how we select our judges in this country.
											It&#39;s very different than most other cultures. All right?

									<p>
											The other one that I want to suggest,
											the caution that all of us have to have,
											I constantly have to remind myself,
											about just how accurate are the memories
											that we know are true, that we believe in?
											There is decades of research,
											examples and examples of cases like this,
											where individuals
											really, really believe. None of those teenagers
											who identified him
											thought that they were picking the wrong person.
											None of them thought they couldn&#39;t see the person&#39;s face.
											We all have to be very careful.
											All our memories are reconstructed memories.
											They are the product of what we originally experienced
											and everything that&#39;s happened afterwards.
											They&#39;re dynamic.
											They&#39;re malleable. They&#39;re volatile,
											and as a result, we all need to remember to be cautious,
											that the accuracy of our memories
											is not measured in how vivid they are
											nor how certain you are that they&#39;re correct.

Scott Fraser is an expert witness who researches what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s selective when it comes to human memory and crime. His areas of expertise include human night vision, neuropsychopharmacology, and the effect of stress and other factors on the human mind. He has testified in criminal and civil cases throughout the U.S. in state and federal courts.</p>  <p>In 2011 Fraser was involved in the retrial of a 1992 murder case in which Francisco Carrillo was found guilty and sentenced to two life sentences in prison. Fraser and the team that hired him staged a dramatic reenactment of the night of the murder in question and showed the testimonies that had put Carrillo in jail were unreliable. After 20 years in jail for a crime he didn&#39;t commit, Carrillo was freed.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Scott Fraser","tags":["TEDx","crime","global issues","government","law","memory","mind","prison","science","psychology","neuroscience","cognitive science","brain","sight","forensics"],"title":"Why eyewitnesses get it wrong","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1108266}]}
