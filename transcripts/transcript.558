											The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated
											to presenting great American lives,
											amazing people.
											And that&#39;s what it&#39;s about.
											We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that&#39;s it.
											And so I&#39;m not going to talk about the painted portrait today.
											I&#39;m going to talk about a program I started there,
											which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I started to worry about the fact
											that a lot of people don&#39;t get their portraits painted anymore,
											and they&#39;re amazing people,
											and we want to deliver them to future generations.
											So, how do we do that?
											And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.
											And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically
											my being a brush in the hand
											of amazing people who would come and I would interview.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so what I&#39;m going to do is, not so much give you
											the great hits of that program,
											as to give you this whole notion
											of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,
											what you try to find out about them,
											and when people deliver and when they don&#39;t and why.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, I had two preconditions.
											One was that they be American.
											That&#39;s just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,
											it&#39;s created to look at American lives.
											That was easy, but then I made the decision,
											maybe arbitrary,
											that they needed to be people of a certain age,
											which at that point, when I created this program,
											seemed really old.
											Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.
											For obvious reasons, it doesn&#39;t seem that old anymore to me.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And why did I do that?
											Well, for one thing, we&#39;re a youth-obsessed culture.
											And I thought really what we need is an elders program
											to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.
											But the second part of it — and the older I get,
											the more convinced I am that that&#39;s true.
											It&#39;s amazing what people will say when they know
											how the story turned out.
											That&#39;s the one advantage that older people have.
											Well, they have other, little bit of advantage,
											but they also have some disadvantages,
											but the one thing they or we have is that
											we&#39;ve reached the point in life
											where we know how the story turned out.
											So, we can then go back in our lives,
											if we&#39;ve got an interviewer who gets that,
											and begin to reflect on how we got there.
											All of those accidents that wound up
											creating the life narrative that we inherited.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, I thought okay, now,
											what is it going to take to make this work?
											There are many kinds of interviews. We know them.
											There are the journalist interviews,
											which are the interrogation that is expected.
											This is somewhat against resistance
											and caginess on the part of the interviewee.
											Then there&#39;s the celebrity interview,
											where it&#39;s more important who&#39;s asking the question than who answers.
											That&#39;s Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.
											That&#39;s Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important
											as Nixon in that process.
											Fair enough.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But I wanted interviews that were different.
											I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,
											which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say
											and to be an agent of their self-revelation.
											By the way, this was always done in public.
											This was not an oral history program.
											This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,
											and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.
											I didn&#39;t know it coming into it.
											And the only reason I really know that
											is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,
											and that was six months after he&#39;d had a stroke.
											And he had never appeared in public since that point.
											This was not a devastating stroke,
											but it did affect his speaking and so forth.
											And I thought it was worth a chance,
											he thought it was worth a chance,
											and so we got up on the stage,
											and we had an hour conversation about his life,
											and after that a woman rushed up to me,
											essentially did,
											and she said, &quot;Where did you train as a doctor?&quot;

											Who makes a great interview in this context?
											It had nothing to do with their intellect,

											Some of them were very brilliant,
											some of them were,

											It was about their energy.
											It&#39;s energy that creates extraordinary interviews

											In fact, the first person I interviewed

											and Abbott was filled with the life force —
											I guess that&#39;s the way I think about it — filled with it.
											And so he filled the room,
											and we had an extraordinary conversation.
											He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do
											because he was famous for being silent,
											for never ever saying anything
											except maybe a word or two.
											And, in fact, he did wind up opening up —
											by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.

											And she began to talk about things that had happened
											to her body and her face,
											and how she could no longer count on her beauty,
											and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one
											for whom all the ballet lessons were given.
											And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,
											and in that process, she made a number of decisions.
											First of all, was that dance, even though
											it hadn&#39;t been offered to her, was her life.
											And secondly, she had better be,
											although she did dance for a while, a choreographer
											because then her looks didn&#39;t matter.
											But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.

											It was an amazing privilege to do this series.
											There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.
											The key point was empathy
											because everybody in their lives
											is really waiting for people to ask them questions,
											so that they can be truthful about who they are
											and how they became what they are,
											and I commend that to you, even if you&#39;re not doing interviews.
											Just be that way with your friends
											and particularly the older members of your family.
