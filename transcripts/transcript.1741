Growing inequality is about to push our societies into conditions resembling pre-revolutionary France. Hear his argument about why a dramatic increase in minimum wage could grow the middle class, deliver economic prosperity ... and prevent a revolution." />

											You probably don&#39;t know me,
											but I am one of those .01 percenters
											that you hear about and read about,
											and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat.
											And tonight, what I would like to do is speak directly
											to other plutocrats, to my people,
											because it feels like it&#39;s time for us all
											to have a chat.
											Like most plutocrats, I too am a proud
											and unapologetic capitalist.
											I have founded, cofounded or funded
											over 30 companies across a range of industries.
											I was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.
											I cofounded a company called aQuantive
											that we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.
											My friends and I, we own a bank.
											I tell you this — (Laughter) —
											unbelievable, right?

									<p>
											I tell you this to show
											that my life is like most plutocrats.
											I have a broad perspective on capitalism
											and business,
											and I have been rewarded obscenely for that
											with a life that most of you all
											can&#39;t even imagine:
											multiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,
											etc., etc., etc.
											But let&#39;s be honest: I am not the
smartest person you&#39;ve ever met.
											I am certainly not the hardest working.
											I was a mediocre student.
											I&#39;m not technical at all.
											I can&#39;t write a word of code.
											Truly, my success is the consequence
											of spectacular luck,
											of birth, of circumstance and of timing.
											But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things.
											One, I have an unusually high tolerance for risk,
											and the other is I have a good sense,
											a good intuition about what will happen in the future,
											and I think that that intuition about the future
											is the essence of good entrepreneurship.

									<p>
											So what do I see in our future today,
											you ask?
											I see pitchforks,
											as in angry mobs with pitchforks,
											because while people like us plutocrats
											are living beyond the dreams of avarice,
											the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens
											are falling farther and farther behind.
											In 1980, the top one percent of Americans
											shared about eight percent of national [income],
											while the bottom 50 percent of Americans
											shared 18 percent.
											Thirty years later, today, the top one percent
											shares over 20 percent of national [income],
											while the bottom 50 percent of Americans
											share 12 or 13.
											If the trend continues,
											the top one percent will share
											over 30 percent of national [income]
											in another 30 years,
											while the bottom 50 percent of Americans
											will share just six.

									<p>
											You see, the problem isn&#39;t that we have
											some inequality.
											Some inequality is necessary
											for a high-functioning capitalist democracy.
											The problem is that inequality
											is at historic highs today
											and it&#39;s getting worse every day.
											And if wealth, power, and income
											continue to concentrate
											at the very tippy top,
											our society will change
											from a capitalist democracy
											to a neo-feudalist rentier society
											like 18th-century France.
											That was France
											before the revolution
											and the mobs with the pitchforks.

											So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats
											and zillionaires
											and for anyone who lives
											in a gated bubble world:
											Wake up.
											Wake up. It cannot last.
											Because if we do not do something
											to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society,
											the pitchforks will come for us,
											for no free and open society can long sustain
											this kind of rising economic inequality.
											It has never happened. There are no examples.
											You show me a highly unequal society,
											and I will show you a police state
											or an uprising.
											The pitchforks will come for us
											if we do not address this.
											It&#39;s not a matter of if, it&#39;s when.

											I know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.
											I&#39;m not. I&#39;m not making a moral argument
											that economic inequality is wrong.
											What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality
											is stupid and ultimately self-defeating.
											Rising inequality doesn&#39;t just increase our risks
											from pitchforks,
											but it&#39;s also terrible for business too.
											So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford.
											When Ford famously introduced the $5 day,
											which was twice the prevailing wage at the time,
											he didn&#39;t just increase the productivity
											of his factories,
											he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor
											into a thriving middle class who could now afford
											to buy the products that they made.
											Ford intuited what we now know is true,
											that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem
											and characterized by the same kinds
											of feedback loops you find
											in a natural ecosystem,
											a feedback loop between customers and businesses.
											Raising wages increases demand,
											which increases hiring,
											which in turn increases wages
											and demand and profits,
											and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity
											is precisely what is missing
											from today&#39;s economic recovery.

											And this is why we need to put behind us
											the trickle-down policies that so dominate
											both political parties
											and embrace something I call middle-out economics.
											Middle-out economics rejects
											the neoclassical economic idea
											that economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic,
											that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness,
											and instead embraces the 21st-century idea
											that economies are complex, adaptive,
											ecosystemic,
											that they tend away from
equilibrium and toward inequality,
											that they&#39;re not efficient at all
											but are effective if well managed.
											This 21st-century perspective
											allows you to clearly see that capitalism
											does not work by [efficiently] allocating
											existing resources.
											It works by [efficiently] creating new solutions
											to human problems.
											The genius of capitalism
											is that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system.
											It rewards people for solving
other people&#39;s problems.
											The difference between a poor society
											and a rich society, obviously,
											is the degree to which that society
											has generated solutions in the form
											of products for its citizens.
											The sum of the solutions
											that we have in our society
											really is our prosperity, and this explains
											why companies like Google and Amazon
											and Microsoft and Apple
											and the entrepreneurs who created those companies
											have contributed so much
											to our nation&#39;s prosperity.

											This 21st-century perspective
											also makes clear
											that what we think of as economic growth
											is best understood as
											the rate at which we solve problems.
											But that rate is totally dependent upon
											how many problem solvers —
											diverse, able problem solvers — we have,
											and thus how many of our fellow citizens
											actively participate,
											both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,
											and as customers who consume them.
											But this maximizing participation thing
											doesn&#39;t happen by accident.
											It doesn&#39;t happen by itself.
											It requires effort and investment,
											which is why all
											highly prosperous capitalist democracies
											are characterized by massive investments
											in the middle class and the infrastructure
											that they depend on.

											We plutocrats need to get this
											trickle-down economics thing behind us,
											this idea that the better we do,
											the better everyone else will do.
											It&#39;s not true. How could it be?
											I earn 1,000 times the median wage,
											but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,
											do I?
											I actually bought two pairs of these pants,
											what my partner Mike calls
											my manager pants.
											I could have bought 2,000 pairs,
											but what would I do with them? (Laughter)
											How many haircuts can I get?
											How often can I go out to dinner?
											No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,
											we can never drive a great national economy.
											Only a thriving middle class can do that.
											There&#39;s nothing to be done,
											my plutocrat friends might say.
											Henry Ford was in a different time.
											Maybe we can&#39;t do some things.
											Maybe we can do some things.
											June 19, 2013,
											Bloomberg published an article I wrote called
											&quot;The Capitalist’s Case for a $15 Minimum Wage.&quot;
											The good people at Forbes magazine,
											among my biggest admirers,
											called it &quot;Nick Hanauer&#39;s near-insane proposal.&quot;
											And yet, just 350 days
											after that article was published,
											Seattle&#39;s Mayor Ed Murray signed into law
											an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle
											to 15 dollars an hour,
											more than double
											what the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is.
											How did this happen,
											reasonable people might ask.
											It happened because a group of us
											reminded the middle class
											that they are the source
											of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies.
											We reminded them that when
workers have more money,
											businesses have more customers,
											and need more employees.
											We reminded them that when businesses
											pay workers a living wage,
											taxpayers are relieved of the burden
											of funding the poverty programs
											like food stamps and medical assistance
											and rent assistance
											that those workers need.
											We reminded them that low-wage workers
											make terrible taxpayers,
											and that when you raise the minimum wage
											for all businesses,
											all businesses benefit
											yet all can compete.

											Now the orthodox reaction, of course,
											is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right?
											Your politician&#39;s always echoing

											&quot;Well, if you raise the price of employment,

											Are you sure?
											Because there&#39;s some contravening evidence.
											Since 1980, the wages of CEOs in our country
											have gone from about 30 times the median wage
											to 500 times.
											That&#39;s raising the price of employment.
											And yet, to my knowledge,
											I have never seen a company
											outsource its CEO&#39;s job, automate their job,
											export the job to China.
											In fact, we appear to be employing
											more CEOs and senior managers than ever before.
											So too for technology workers
											and financial services workers,
											who earn multiples of the median wage
											and yet we employ more and more of them,
											so clearly you can raise the price of employment
											and get more of it.

											I know that most people
											think that the $15 minimum wage
											is this insane, risky economic experiment.
											We disagree.
											We believe that the $15 minimum wage
											in Seattle
											is actually the continuation
											of a logical economic policy.
											It is allowing our city
											to kick your city&#39;s ass.
											Because, you see,
											Washington state already has
											the highest minimum wage
											of any state in the nation.
											We pay all workers $9.32,
											which is almost 30 percent more
											than the federal minimum of 7.25,
											but crucially, 427 percent more
											than the federal tipped minimum of 2.13.
											If trickle-down thinkers were right,
											then Washington state should
have massive unemployment.
											Seattle should be sliding into the ocean.
											And yet, Seattle
											is the fastest-growing big city in the country.
											Washington state is generating small business jobs
											at a higher rate than any other major state
											in the nation.
											The restaurant business in Seattle? Booming.
											Why? Because the fundamental law of capitalism is,
											when workers have more money,
											businesses have more customers
											and need more workers.
											When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough
											so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants,
											that&#39;s not bad for the restaurant business.
											That&#39;s good for it,
											despite what some restaurateurs may tell you.

											Is it more complicated than I&#39;m making out?
											Of course it is.
											There are a lot of dynamics at play.
											But can we please stop insisting
											that if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,
											unemployment will skyrocket
											and the economy will collapse?
											There is no evidence for it.
											The most insidious thing
											about trickle-down economics
											is not the claim that if the rich get richer,
											everyone is better off.
											It is the claim made by those who oppose
											any increase in the minimum wage
											that if the poor get richer,
											that will be bad for the economy.
											This is nonsense.
											So can we please dispense with this rhetoric
											that says that rich guys like me
											and my plutocrat friends
											made our country?
											We plutocrats know,
											even if we don&#39;t like to admit it in public,
											that if we had been born somewhere else,
											not here in the United States,
											we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot
											by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.

											So here&#39;s an idea for a new kind of economics,
											a new kind of politics
											that I call new capitalism.
											Let&#39;s acknowledge that capitalism
											beats the alternatives,
											but also that the more people we include,
											both as entrepreneurs and as customers,
											the better it works.
											Let&#39;s by all means shrink the size of government,
											but not by slashing the poverty programs,
											but by ensuring that workers are paid enough
											so that they actually don&#39;t need those programs.
											Let&#39;s invest enough in the middle class
											to make our economy fairer and more inclusive,
											and by fairer, more truly competitive,
											and by more truly competitive,
											more able to generate the solutions
											to human problems
											that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity.
											Capitalism is the greatest social technology
											ever invented
											for creating prosperity in human societies,
											if it is well managed,
											but capitalism, because of the fundamental
											multiplicative dynamics of complex systems,
											tends towards, inexorably, inequality,
											concentration and collapse.
											The work of democracies
											is to maximize the inclusion of the many
											in order to create prosperity,
											not to enable the few to accumulate money.
											Government does create prosperity and growth,
											by creating the conditions that allow
											both entrepreneurs and their customers
											to thrive.
											Balancing the power of capitalists like me
											and workers isn&#39;t bad for capitalism.
											It&#39;s essential to it.
											Programs like a reasonable minimum wage,
											affordable healthcare,
											paid sick leave,
											and the progressive taxation necessary
											to pay for the important infrastructure
											necessary for the middle class like education, R and D,
											these are indispensable tools
											shrewd capitalists should embrace
											to drive growth, because no one benefits from it
											like us.

											Many economists would have you believe
											that their field is an objective science.
											I disagree, and I think that it is equally
											a tool that humans use
											to enforce and encode
											our social and moral preferences and prejudices
											about status and power,
											which is why plutocrats like me
											have always needed to find persuasive stories
											to tell everyone else
											about why our relative positions
											are morally righteous and good for everyone:
											like, we are indispensable, the job creators,
											and you are not;
											like, tax cuts for us create growth,
											but investments in you
											will balloon our debt
											and bankrupt our great country;
											that we matter;
											that you don&#39;t.
											For thousands of years, these stories were called
											divine right.
											Today, we have trickle-down economics.
											How obviously, transparently self-serving
											all of this is.
											We plutocrats need to see
											that the United States of America made us,
											not the other way around;
											that a thriving middle class is the source
											of prosperity in capitalist economies,
											not a consequence of it.
											And we should never forget
											that even the best of us in
the worst of circumstances
											are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.

											the most dynamic and prosperous in the world.
											Let&#39;s secure the future for ourselves,

As a few highlights, he cofounded a company called aQuantive that sold to Microsoft for $6.4 billion, and was the first non-family investor in Amazon.<br /><br />Meanwhile Hanauer, a &ldquo;proud and unapologetic capitalist,&rdquo; has also been looking closely at society&rsquo;s growing inequality gap, and the consequences it holds for our shared destiny &mdash; and the ultimate fate of our democracies. In 2007, he and civic activist Eric Liu co-wrote the book <a href=\"http://geni.us/truepatriot\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The True Patriot</em></a>, an examination of progressive patriotism. This was followed by 2011&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://geni.us/gardensofdemocracy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Gardens of Democracy</em></a>, also with Liu, a vision for &ldquo;growing&rdquo; good citizens. </p><p>In 2013, Hanauer published a commentary in <em>Bloomberg BusinessWeek</em> proposing a <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2011-12-01/raise-taxes-on-the-rich-to-reward-job-creators-commentary-by-nick-hanauer\" target=\"_blank\">$15 minimum wage</a>  (a suggestion that Seattle acted on this year). Early in 2014, he and Eric Beinhocker published &quot;<a href=\"http://www.democracyjournal.org/31/capitalism-redefined.php?page=all\" target=\"_blank\">Capitalism, Redefined</a>.&quot; In the summer of 2014, Hanauer published a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014.html\" target=\"_blank\">much-shared essay in <em>Politico</em></a>  that suggests, if societal inequality is allowed to grow unchecked, modern societies could start looking an awful lot like pre-Revolutionary France. </p><p>He is working on a new book, due out in 2015.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Nick Hanauer","tags":["business","economics","inequality","social change"],"title":"Beware, fellow plutocrats, the pitchforks are coming","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1798920}]}
