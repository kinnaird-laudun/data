<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In an unmissable talk about race and politics in America, Theo E.J. Wilson tells the story of becoming Lucius25, white supremacist lurker, and the unexpected compassion and surprising perspective he found from engaging with people he disagrees with. He encourages us to let go of fear, embrace curiosity and have courageous conversations with people who think differently from us. &quot;Conversations stop violence, conversations start countries and build bridges,&quot; he says." />

<meta content='In an unmissable talk about race and politics in America, Theo E.J. Wilson tells the story of becoming Lucius25, white supremacist lurker, and the unexpected compassion and surprising perspective he found from engaging with people he disagrees with. He encourages us to let go of fear, embrace curiosity and have courageous conversations with people who think differently from us. "Conversations stop violence, conversations start countries and build bridges," he says.' itemprop='description'>

											So I made more videos

											Human beings all want the same things
											and we have to go through
each other to get these things.
											These courageous conversations
are the way that these bridges are built.
											It&#39;s time that we start
seeing people as people
											and not simply the ideas
that we project onto them or react to.
											Human beings are not the barriers
											but the gateways
to the very things that we want.
											This is a collective
and conscious evolution.

											My journey began with
a terribly popular cell phone video
											and a fallen friend.
											Your journey begins right about now.
											Join the renaissance in human connection.
											It is going to happen with or without you.
											My suggestion: pick a topic,
and start a community dialogue
											in your neck of the woods.
											Meet folks back in real life.
											And I&#39;m going to tell you,
											when you trick the algorithm
of your existence,
											you will get some diversified experiences.
											It is time to grow, people.
											And when we do this, not if,
											it will be clear
that the key to this upgrade
											was always our inner world,
not some device that we create,
											and the doorways
to this experience is now,
											and will forever be, each other.
