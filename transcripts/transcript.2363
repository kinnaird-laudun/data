											Chris Anderson: Welcome
to this next edition of TED Dialogues.
											We&#39;re trying to do
some bridging here today.
											You know, the American dream
has inspired millions of people
											around the world for many years.
											Today, I think, you can say
that America is divided,
											perhaps more than ever,
											and the divisions seem
to be getting worse.
											It&#39;s actually really hard
for people on different sides
											to even have a conversation.
											People almost feel...
											disgusted with each other.
											Some families can&#39;t even speak
to each other right now.
											Our purpose in this dialogue today
is to try to do something about that,
											to try to have a different kind
of conversation,
											to do some listening, some thinking,
some understanding.
											And I have two people with us
to help us do that.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											They&#39;re not going to come at this
hammer and tong against each other.
											This is not like cable news.
											This is two people who have both spent
a lot of their working life
											in the political center
or right of the center.
											They&#39;ve immersed themselves
in conservative worldviews, if you like.
											They know that space very well.
											And we&#39;re going to explore together
											how to think about
what is happening right now,
											and whether we can find new ways to bridge
											and just to have wiser,
more connected conversations.

											With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,
											who has spent a decade
working at Fox News,
											hosting &quot;Fox and Friends&quot;
and then &quot;The Real Story,&quot;
											before taking a courageous stance
in filing sexual harassment claims
											against Roger Ailes,
											which eventually led
to his departure from Fox News.
											David Brooks, who has earned the wrath
											of many of [The New York Times&#39;s]
left-leaning readers
											because of his conservative views,
											and more recently, perhaps,
some of the right-leaning readers
											because of his criticism
of some aspects of Trump.
											Yet, his columns are usually
											the top one, two or three
most-read content of the day
											because they&#39;re brilliant,
											because they bring psychology
and social science
											to providing understanding
for what&#39;s going on.
											So without further ado, a huge welcome
to Gretchen and David.
											Come and join me.

											Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot
of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.
											I mean, I think it was a movement
of sorts, but it started long ago.
											It didn&#39;t just happen overnight.
											&quot;Anger&quot; would be the first word
that I would think of —
											anger with nothing
being done in Washington,
											anger about not being heard.
											I think there was a huge swath
of the population
											that feels like Washington
never listens to them,
											you know, a good part of the middle
of America, not just the coasts,
											and he was somebody they felt
was listening to their concerns.
											So I think those two issues
would be the main reason.
											I have to throw in there also celebrity.
											I think that had a huge impact
on Donald Trump becoming president.

											David Brooks: Yeah, I think so.
											In 2015 and early 2016,

											with the following theme:
											don&#39;t worry, Donald Trump will never
be the Republican nominee.

											And having done that
and gotten that so wrong,
											I decided to spend the ensuing year
just out in Trumpworld,
											and I found a lot of economic dislocation.
											I ran into a woman in West Virginia
who was going to a funeral for her mom.
											She said, &quot;The nice thing about
being Catholic is we don&#39;t have to speak,
											and that&#39;s good,
because we&#39;re not word people.&quot;
											That phrase rung in my head: word people.
											A lot of us in the TED community
are word people,
											but if you&#39;re not, the economy
has not been angled toward you,
											and so 11 million men, for example,
are out of the labor force
											because those jobs are done away.
											A lot of social injury.
											You used to be able to say,
&quot;I&#39;m not the richest person in the world,
											I&#39;m not the most famous,
											but my neighbors can count on me
and I get some dignity out of that.&quot;
											And because of celebritification
or whatever, if you&#39;re not rich or famous,
											you feel invisible.
											And a lot of moral injury,
sense of feeling betrayed,
											and frankly, in this country,
we almost have one success story,
											which is you go to college, get
a white-collar job, and you&#39;re a success,
											and if you don&#39;t fit in that formula,
											you feel like you&#39;re not respected.
											And so that accumulation of things —
											and when I talked to Trump
voters and still do,
											I found most of them completely
realistic about his failings,
											but they said, this is my shot.

he did extremely well

											Hey, let&#39;s keep the conversation going.
											We&#39;re continuing to try and figure out
											whether we can add something here,
											so keep the conversation
going on Facebook.
											Give us your thoughts from whatever part
of the political spectrum you&#39;re on,
											and actually, wherever
in the world you are.
											This is not just about America.
It&#39;s about the world, too.
											But we&#39;re not going
to end today without music,
											because if we put music
in every political conversation,
											the world would be
completely different, frankly.
											It just would.

											She created this program

and the impact of gospel music,

In 2016, Carlson became the face of sexual harassment in the workplace after her lawsuit against Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes paved the way for thousands of other women facing harassment to tell their stories. Carlson&#39;s advocacy put her on the cover of <em>TIME</em>, and her new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/bA2l5CE\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back</em></a>, joined the <em>New York Times</em> best-seller list the week it was published. She became a columnist for <em>TIME</em>&#39;s&nbsp;online &quot;Motto&quot; newsletter in 2017, focusing on gender and empowerment issues.</p><p>Carlson&#39;s ongoing work on behalf of women includes advocating for arbitration reform on Capitol Hill; in 2018, she plans to testify before Congress about workplace inequality and forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Carlson also created the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gretchencarlson.com/philanthropy/\" target=\"_blank\">Gift of Courage Fund</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aitogether.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gretchen Carlson Leadership Initiative</a>&nbsp;to support empowerment, advocacy and anti-harassment programs for girls and underserved women.</p><p>Carlson hosted &quot;The Real Story&quot; on Fox News for three years; co-hosted &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; for seven years; and in her first book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/mjTt\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, became a national best-seller. She co-hosted &quot;The Saturday Early Show&quot; for CBS in 2000 and served as a CBS News correspondent covering stories including Geneoa&#39;s G-8 Summit, Timothy McVeigh&rsquo;s execution, 9/11 from the World Trade Center and the Bush-Gore election. She started her reporting career in Richmond, Virginia, then served as an anchor and reporter in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dallas, where she produced and reported a 30-part series on domestic violence that won several national awards.</p><p>An honors graduate of Stanford University, Carlson was valedictorian of her high school class and studied at Oxford University in England. A child prodigy on the violin, she performed as a soloist with the Minnesota Symphony Orchestra at age 13, and in 1989, became the first classical violinist to win the Miss America crown.</p><p>Ever grateful for the opportunities provided to her and imbued with a &quot;never give up&quot; attitude, Carlson has mentored dozens of young women throughout her career. She serves as a national&nbsp;trustee for the March of Dimes, a member of the board of directors for the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary in Newtown, Connecticut and a trustee of Greenwich Academy, an all-girls preparatory day school in Greenwich, Connecticut. Carlson is married to sports agent Casey Close and mom to their two children.</p>"},{"id":"3332","slug":"vy_higginsen_s_gospel_choir_of_harlem","is_published":true,"firstname":"","lastname":"Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"Gospel ensemble","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/9d4b8cb9a66362e48be5738571a05db45e1b165b_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"","whotheyare":"Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir of Harlem is an influential source of education and self-development for young people.","whylisten":"<p>Vy Higginsen&#39;s Gospel Choir of Harlem is a celebrated group of performers elevated from the Mama Foundation for the Arts&#39; Music School of Gospel, Jazz and R&amp;B.

The award-winning, nationally recognized program offers performance choirs small, medium, and large and has been seen accompanying many of today&#39;s pop icons including Ariana Grande, Chance the Rapper, Pharrell Williams, Alessia Cara and Madonna.</p><p>In addition to various performances and collaborations throughout New York City, the choir enjoys weekly performances in Harlem. They can be seen every Sunday headlining Ginny Supper Club&#39;s Gospel Brunch at Marcus Samuelson&#39;s acclaimed restaurant, Red Rooster, which is ranked one of the top five gospel brunches in the nation.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/gretchen_carlson_david_brooks_political_common_ground_in_a_polarized_united_states","viewed_count":979724,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"How can we bridge the gap between left and right to have a wiser, more connected political conversation?

tireless advocate for workplace equality and women's empowerment.","whylisten":"<p>Named one of <em>TIME</em>&#39;s&nbsp;100 Most Influential People in the World for 2017, Gretchen Carlson is one of the nation&#39;s most highly acclaimed journalists and a warrior for women. In 2016, Carlson became the face of sexual harassment in the workplace after her lawsuit against Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes paved the way for thousands of other women facing harassment to tell their stories. Carlson&#39;s advocacy put her on the cover of <em>TIME</em>, and her new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/bA2l5CE\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back</em></a>, joined the <em>New York Times</em> best-seller list the week it was published. She became a columnist for <em>TIME</em>&#39;s&nbsp;online &quot;Motto&quot; newsletter in 2017, focusing on gender and empowerment issues.</p><p>Carlson&#39;s ongoing work on behalf of women includes advocating for arbitration reform on Capitol Hill; in 2018, she plans to testify before Congress about workplace inequality and forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Carlson also created the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gretchencarlson.com/philanthropy/\" target=\"_blank\">Gift of Courage Fund</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aitogether.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gretchen Carlson Leadership Initiative</a>&nbsp;to support empowerment, advocacy and anti-harassment programs for girls and underserved women.</p><p>Carlson hosted &quot;The Real Story&quot; on Fox News for three years; co-hosted &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; for seven years; and in her first book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/mjTt\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, became a national best-seller. She co-hosted &quot;The Saturday Early Show&quot; for CBS in 2000 and served as a CBS News correspondent covering stories including Geneoa&#39;s G-8 Summit, Timothy McVeigh&rsquo;s execution, 9/11 from the World Trade Center and the Bush-Gore election. She started her reporting career in Richmond, Virginia, then served as an anchor and reporter in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dallas, where she produced and reported a 30-part series on domestic violence that won several national awards.</p><p>An honors graduate of Stanford University, Carlson was valedictorian of her high school class and studied at Oxford University in England. A child prodigy on the violin, she performed as a soloist with the Minnesota Symphony Orchestra at age 13, and in 1989, became the first classical violinist to win the Miss America crown.</p><p>Ever grateful for the opportunities provided to her and imbued with a &quot;never give up&quot; attitude, Carlson has mentored dozens of young women throughout her career. She serves as a national&nbsp;trustee for the March of Dimes, a member of the board of directors for the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary in Newtown, Connecticut and a trustee of Greenwich Academy, an all-girls preparatory day school in Greenwich, Connecticut. Carlson is married to sports agent Casey Close and mom to their two children.</p>"},{"id":"3332","slug":"vy_higginsen_s_gospel_choir_of_harlem","is_published":true,"firstname":"","lastname":"Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"Gospel ensemble","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/9d4b8cb9a66362e48be5738571a05db45e1b165b_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"","whotheyare":"Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir of Harlem is an influential source of education and self-development for young people.","whylisten":"<p>Vy Higginsen&#39;s Gospel Choir of Harlem is a celebrated group of performers elevated from the Mama Foundation for the Arts&#39; Music School of Gospel, Jazz and R&amp;B.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Gretchen Carlson, David Brooks","tags":["collaboration","communication","democracy","government","future","history","humanity","immigration","identity","inequality","infrastructure","journalism","policy","news","security","politics","social media","social change","women","United States","writing"],"title":"Political common ground in a polarized United States","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":979724}]}
