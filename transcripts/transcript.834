											I&#39;m speaking to you about what I call the &quot;mesh.&quot;
											It&#39;s essentially a fundamental shift
											in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.
											And it&#39;s starting to look at —
											not always and not for everything —
											but in certain moments of time,
											access to certain kinds of goods and service
											will trump ownership of them.
											And so it&#39;s the pursuit of better things,
											easily shared.
											And we come from a long tradition of sharing.
											We&#39;ve shared transportation.
											We&#39;ve shared wine and food
											and other sorts of fabulous experiences
											in coffee bars in Amsterdam.
											We&#39;ve also shared other sorts of entertainment —
											sports arenas, public parks,
											concert halls, libraries,
											universities.
											All these things are share-platforms,
											but sharing ultimately starts and ends
											with what I refer to
											as the &quot;mother of all share-platforms.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And as I think about the mesh
											and I think about, well, what&#39;s driving it,
											how come it&#39;s happening now,
											I think there&#39;s a number of vectors
											that I want to give you as background.
											One is the recession —
											that the recession has caused us
											to rethink our relationship
											with the things in our lives relative to the value —
											so starting to align the value
											with the true cost.
											Secondly, population growth
											and density into cities.
											More people, smaller spaces,
											less stuff.
											Climate change:
											we&#39;re trying to reduce the stress
											in our personal lives and in our communities
											and on the planet.
											Also, there&#39;s been this recent distrust
											of big brands, global big brands,
											in a bunch of different industries,
											and that&#39;s created an opening.
											Research is showing here, in the States,
											and in Canada and Western Europe,
											that most of us are much more open
											to local companies,
											or brands that maybe we haven&#39;t heard of.
											Whereas before, we went with the big brands
											that we were sure we trusted.
											And last is that
											we&#39;re more connected now to more people on the planet
											than ever before —
											except for if you&#39;re sitting next to someone.

											The other thing that&#39;s worth considering
											is that we&#39;ve made a huge investment
											over decades and decades,
											and tens of billions of dollars
											have gone into this investment
											that now is our inheritance.
											It&#39;s a physical infrastructure
											that allows us to get from point A to point B
											and move things that way.
											It&#39;s also — Web and mobile
											allow us to be connected
											and create all kinds of platforms and systems,
											and the investment of those technologies
											and that infrastructure
											is really our inheritance.
											It allows us to engage
											in really new and interesting ways.

											And so for me, a mesh company, the &quot;classic&quot; mesh company,
											brings together these three things:
											our ability to connect to each other —
											most of us are walking around with these mobile devices
											that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled —
											allows us to find each other
											and find things in time and space.
											And third is that physical things
											are readable on a map —
											so restaurants, a variety of venues,
											but also with GPS and other technology
											like RFID
											and it continues to expand beyond that,
											we can also track things that are moving,
											like a car, a taxicab, a transit system,
											a box that&#39;s moving through time and space.
											And so that sets up
											for making access to get goods and services
											more convenient and less costly in many cases
											than owning them.

											For example, I want to use Zipcar.
											How many people here have experienced
											car-sharing or bike-sharing?
											Wow, that&#39;s great. Okay, thank you.
											Basically Zipcar
											is the largest car-sharing company in the world.
											They did not invent car-sharing.
											Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.
											One of the founders went to Switzerland,
											saw it implemented someplace,
											said, &quot;Wow, that looks really cool.
											I think we can do that in Cambridge,&quot;
											brought it to Cambridge
											and they started — two women —
											Robin Chase being the other person who started it.
											Zipcar got some really important things right.
											First, they really understood
											that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.
											And so they were very clever
											about the way that they packaged car-sharing.
											They made it sexy. They made it fresh.
											They made it aspirational.
											If you were a member of the club,
											when you&#39;re a member of a club, you&#39;re a Zipster.
											The cars they picked didn&#39;t look like ex-cop cars
											that were hollowed out or something.
											They picked these sexy cars.
											They targeted to universities.
											They made sure that the demographic
											for who they were targeting and the car was all matching.
											It was a very nice experience,
											and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.

									<p>
											And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.
											But they understood fundamentally
											that they are not a car company.
											They understand that they are an information company.
											Because when we buy a car
											we go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we&#39;re chow —
											usually as quickly as possible.
											But when you&#39;re sharing a car and you have a car-share service,
											you might use an E.V. to commute,
											you get a truck because you&#39;re doing a home project.
											When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.
											And you&#39;re going to the mountains to ski,
											you get different accessories put on the car
											for doing that sort of thing.
											Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back,
											collecting all sorts of data
											about our behavior and how we interact with the service.
											And so it&#39;s not only an option for them,
											but I believe it&#39;s an imperative
											for Zipcar and other mesh companies
											to actually just wow us,
											to be like a concierge service.
											Because we give them so much information,
											and they are entitled to really see
											how it is that we&#39;re moving.
											They&#39;re in really good shape to anticipate
											what we&#39;re going to want next.

											And so what percent of the day
											do you think the average person uses a car?
											What percentage of the time?
											Any guesses?
											Those are really very good.
											I was imagining it was like
											20 percent when I first started.
											The number across the U.S. and Western Europe
											is eight percent.
											And so basically even if you think it&#39;s 10 percent,
											90 percent of the time,
											something that costs us a lot of money —
											personally, and also we organize our cities around it
											and all sorts of things —
											90 percent of the time it&#39;s sitting around.
											So for this reason,
											I think one of the other themes with the mesh
											is essentially that, if we squeeze hard
											on things that we&#39;ve thrown away,
											there&#39;s a lot of value in those things.
											What set up with Zipcar — Zipcar started in 2000.

											In the last year, 2010,
											two car companies started,
											one that&#39;s in the U.K. called WhipCar,
											and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.
											They&#39;re both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,
											because the two things that really work for car-sharing
											is, one, the car has to be available,
											and two, it&#39;s within one or two blocks
											of where you stand.
											Well the car that&#39;s one or two blocks from your home or your office
											is probably your neighbor&#39;s car,
											and it&#39;s probably also available.
											So people have created this business.
											Zipcar started a decade earlier,
											in 2000.
											It took them six years
											to get 1,000 cars in service.
											WhipCar, which started April of last year,
											it took them six months
											to get 1,000 cars in the service.
											So, really interesting.
											People are making anywhere between
											200 and 700 dollars a month
											letting their neighbors use their car when they&#39;re not using it.
											So it&#39;s like vacation rentals for cars.
											Since I&#39;m here —
											and I hope some people in the audience
											are in the car business —
											(Laughter)
											— I&#39;m thinking that, coming from the technology side of things —
											we saw cable-ready TVs
											and WiFi-ready Notebooks —
											it would be really great if, any minute now,
											you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.
											Because it just creates more flexibility.
											It allows us as owners to have other options.
											And I think we&#39;re going there anyway.

											The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses —
											and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix
											that are full mesh businesses,
											or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,
											car manufacturers,
											who are beginning to offer
											their own car-share services
											as well as a second flanker brand,
											or as really a test, I think —
											is to make sharing irresistible.
											We have experiences in our lives, certainly,
											when sharing has been irresistible.
											It&#39;s just, how do we make that recurrent
											and scale it?
											We know also, because we&#39;re connected in social networks,
											that it&#39;s easy to create delight
											in one little place.
											It&#39;s contagious because we&#39;re all connected to each other.
											So if I have a terrific experience
											and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.
											The opposite, as we know, is also true,
											often more true.

											So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,
											doing the things that gourmet food trucks do,
											and they&#39;ve gathered quite a following.
											In general, and maybe, again, it&#39;s because I&#39;m a tech entrepreneur,
											I look at things as platforms.
											Platforms are invitations.
											So creating Craigslist
											or iTunes and the iPhone developer network,
											there are all these networks — Facebook as well.
											These platforms invite all sorts of developers
											and all sorts of people
											to come with their ideas and their opportunity
											to create and target an application
											for a particular audience.
											And honestly, it&#39;s full of surprises.
											Because I don&#39;t think any of us in this room
											could have predicted the sorts of applications
											that have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,
											for example, two years ago,
											when Mark announced
											that they were going to go with a platform.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So in this way, I think that cities are platforms,
											and certainly Detroit is a platform.
											The invitation of bringing
											makers and artists and entrepreneurs —
											it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity
											and helps a city to thrive.
											It&#39;s inviting participation,
											and cities have, historically,
											invited all sorts of participation.
											Now we&#39;re saying that there&#39;s other options as well.
											So, for example, city departments
											can open up transit data.
											Google has made available transit data API.
											And so there&#39;s about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.
											that have provided the transit data,
											and different developers are building applications.
											So I was having a coffee in Portland,
											and half-of-a-latte in
											and the little board in the cafe
											all of a sudden starts showing me
											that the next bus is coming in three minutes
											and the train is coming in 16 minutes.
											And so it&#39;s reliable, real data
											that&#39;s right in my face, where I am,
											so I can finish the latte.

									<p>
											There&#39;s this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:
											about 21 percent
											of vacant commercial and industrial space.
											That space is not vital.
											The areas around it lack vitality
											and vibrancy and engagement.
											There&#39;s this thing — how many people here
											have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?
											Oh, great. So I&#39;m a big fan of this.
											And this is a very mesh-y thing.
											Essentially, there are all sorts
											of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.
											There&#39;s a pop-up general store every three weeks,
											and they do a fantastic job
											of making a very social event
											happening for foodies.
											Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.
											Subsequent to that,
											after it&#39;s been going for about a year now,
											they actually started to lease and create and extend.
											An area that was edgy-artsy
											is now starting to become much cooler
											and engage a lot more people.
											So this is an example.
											The Crafty Fox is this woman who&#39;s into crafts,
											and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.
											But these sorts of things are happening
											in many different environments.
											From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do
											is create perishability and urgency.
											It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:
											sold out.
											And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention
											is a wonderful thing.

									<p>
											So a lot of what we see in the mesh,
											and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built
											allows us to define, refine and scale.
											It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,
											to go to market,
											to be in conversation with people,
											listen, refine something and go back.
											It&#39;s very cost-effective,
											and it&#39;s very mesh-y.
											The infrastructure enables that.

											In closing, and as we&#39;re moving towards the end,
											I just also want to encourage —
											and I&#39;m willing to share my failures as well,
											though not from the stage.
											(Laughter)
											I would just like to say that one of the big things,
											when we look at waste
											and when we look at ways that we can really be generous
											and contribute to each other,
											but also move to create a better economic situation
											and a better environmental situation,
											is by sharing failures.
											And one quick example
											is Velib, in 2007,
											came forward in Paris
											with a very bold proposition,
											a very big bike-sharing service.
											They made a lot of mistakes.
											They had some number of big successes.
											But they were very transparent, or they had to be,
											in the way that they exposed
											what worked and didn&#39;t work.
											And so B.C. in Barcelona
											and B-cycle
											and Boris Bikes in London —
											no one has had to repeat
											the version 1.0 screw-ups
											and expensive learning exercises
											that happened in Paris.
											So the opportunity when we&#39;re connected
											is also to share failures and successes.

											We&#39;re at the very beginning of something
											that, what we&#39;re seeing
											and the way that mesh companies are coming forward,
											is inviting, it&#39;s engaging, but it&#39;s very early.
											I have a website — it&#39;s a directory —
											and it started with about 1,200 companies,
