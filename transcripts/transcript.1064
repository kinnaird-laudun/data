											One of the most common ways of dividing the world
											is into those who believe
											and those who don&#39;t —
											into the religious and the atheists.
											And for the last decade or so,
											it&#39;s been quite clear
											what being an atheist means.
											There have been some very vocal atheists
											who&#39;ve pointed out,
											not just that religion is wrong,
											but that it&#39;s ridiculous.
											These people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford,
											have argued —
											they&#39;ve argued that believing in God
											is akin to believing in fairies
											and essentially that the whole thing
											is a childish game.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now I think it&#39;s too easy.
											I think it&#39;s too easy
											to dismiss the whole of religion that way.
											And it&#39;s as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.
											And what I&#39;d like to inaugurate today
											is a new way of being an atheist —
											if you like, a new version of atheism
											we could call Atheism 2.0.
											Now what is Atheism 2.0?
											Well it starts from a very basic premise:
											of course, there&#39;s no God.
											Of course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits
											or angels, etc.
											Now let&#39;s move on; that&#39;s not the end of the story,
											that&#39;s the very, very beginning.

											I&#39;m interested in the kind of constituency
											that thinks something along these lines:
											that thinks, &quot;I can&#39;t believe in any of this stuff.
											I can&#39;t believe in the doctrines.
											I don&#39;t think these doctrines are right.
											But,&quot; a very important but, &quot;I love Christmas carols.
											I really like the art of Mantegna.
											I really like looking at old churches.
											I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament.&quot;
											Whatever it may be,
											you know the kind of thing I&#39;m talking about —
											people who are attracted to the ritualistic side,
											the moralistic, communal side of religion,
											but can&#39;t bear the doctrine.
											Until now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.
											It&#39;s almost as though either you accept the doctrine
											and then you can have all the nice stuff,
											or you reject the doctrine and
											you&#39;re living in some kind of spiritual wasteland
											under the guidance of CNN and Walmart.

									<p>
											So that&#39;s a sort of tough choice.
											I don&#39;t think we have to make that choice.
											I think there is an alternative.
											I think there are ways —
											and I&#39;m being both very respectful and completely impious —
											of stealing from religions.
											If you don&#39;t believe in a religion,
											there&#39;s nothing wrong with picking and mixing,
											with taking out the best sides of religion.
											And for me, atheism 2.0
											is about both, as I say,
											a respectful and an impious way
											of going through religions and saying, &quot;What here could we use?&quot;
											The secular world is full of holes.
											We have secularized badly, I would argue.

											I&#39;d like to kick off by looking at education.
											Now education is a field
											the secular world really believes in.
											When we think about how we&#39;re going to make the world a better place,
											we think education; that&#39;s where we put a lot of money.
											Education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,
											it&#39;s also going to make us better people.
											You know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies,
											those lyrical claims
											that education, the process of education — particularly higher education —
											will make us into nobler and better human beings.
											That&#39;s a lovely idea.
											Interesting where it came from.

											In the early 19th century,
											church attendance in Western Europe
											started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.
											They asked themselves the following question.
											They said, where are people going to find the morality,
											where are they going to find guidance,
											and where are they going to find sources of consolation?
											And influential voices came up with one answer.
											They said culture.
											It&#39;s to culture that we should look
											for guidance, for consolation, for morality.
											Let&#39;s look to the plays of Shakespeare,
											the dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.
											In there, we&#39;ll find a lot of the truths
											that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.
											Now I think that&#39;s a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.
											They wanted to replace scripture with culture.
											And that&#39;s a very plausible idea.
											It&#39;s also an idea that we have forgotten.

											You know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,

											He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children
											and children to their parents,
											the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.

											What&#39;s the difference between a sermon

											Well a sermon wants to change your life

											The other things that religions do

											All the major religions give us calendars.
											What is a calendar?
											A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year
											you will bump into certain very important ideas.
											In the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,
											at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome
											and his qualities of humility and goodness
											and his generosity to the poor.
											You won&#39;t do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.
											Now we don&#39;t think that way.
											In the secular world we think, &quot;If an idea is important, I&#39;ll bump into it.
											I&#39;ll just come across it.&quot;
											Nonsense, says the religious world view.
											Religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,
											we need to synchronize encounters.
											This comes across also
											in the way in which religions set up rituals

											The other thing that religions know is we&#39;re not just brains,

											And when they teach us a lesson,
											they do it via the body.
											So for example,

											Jews are very interested in forgiveness

											They don&#39;t just deliver us sermons on this.
											They don&#39;t just give us books or words about this.

											You immerse yourself in the water,

											a ridiculous idea —
											an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble
											and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.
											I couldn&#39;t disagree more.
											The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn&#39;t explain itself,
											that artists shouldn&#39;t say what they&#39;re up to,
											because if they said it, it might destroy the spell
											and we might find it too easy.
											That&#39;s why a very common feeling when you&#39;re in a museum —
											let&#39;s admit it —
											is, &quot;I don&#39;t know what this is about.&quot;

											Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.
											They have no trouble telling us what art is about.
											Art is about two things in all the major faiths.
											Firstly, it&#39;s trying to remind you
											of what there is to love.
											And secondly, it&#39;s trying to remind you
											of what there is to fear and to hate.
											And that&#39;s what art is.
											Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.
											So as you walk around a church,
											or a mosque or a cathedral,
											what you&#39;re trying to imbibe, what you&#39;re imbibing is,
											through your eyes, through your senses,
											truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.

											My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.
											And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum —

											I would make a room for love, a room for generosity.
											All works of art are talking to us about things.
											And if we were able to arrange spaces
											where we could come across works
											where we would be told, use these works of art
											to cement these ideas in your mind,
											we would get a lot more out of art.
											Art would pick up the duty that it used to have

											AB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people
											who say things like, &quot;But isn&#39;t there something bigger than us,
											something else?&quot;
											And I say, &quot;Of course.&quot; And they say, &quot;So aren&#39;t you sort of religious?&quot;
											And I go, &quot;No.&quot; Why does that sense of mystery,
											that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,
											need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?
											Science and just observation
											gives us that feeling without it,
											so I don&#39;t feel the need.
											The universe is large and we are tiny,
											without the need for further religious superstructure.
											So one can have so-called spiritual moments
											without belief in the spirit.

											CA: Actually, let me just ask a question.
											How many people here would say
											that religion is important to them?
											Is there an equivalent process

											AB: I would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life
											and these can be plugged.
											It&#39;s not as though, as I try to suggest,
											it&#39;s not as though either you have religion
											and then you have to accept all sorts of things,
											or you don&#39;t have religion
											and then you&#39;re cut off from all these very good things.
											It&#39;s so sad that we constantly say,
											&quot;I don&#39;t believe so I can&#39;t have community,
											so I&#39;m cut off from morality,
											so I can&#39;t go on a pilgrimage.&quot;
											One wants to say, &quot;Nonsense. Why not?&quot;
											And that&#39;s really the spirit of my talk.
											There&#39;s so much we can absorb.
											Atheism shouldn&#39;t cut itself off from the rich sources of religion.

											CA: It seems to me that there&#39;s plenty of people in the TED community
											who are atheists.
											But probably most people in the community
											certainly don&#39;t think that religion is going away any time soon
											and want to find the language
											to have a constructive dialogue
											and to feel like we can actually talk to each other
											and at least share some things in common.
											Are we foolish to be optimistic
											about the possibility of a world
											where, instead of religion being the great rallying cry

											AB: No, we need to be polite about differences.
											Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.
											It&#39;s seen as hypocrisy.
											But we need to get to a stage when you&#39;re an atheist
											and someone says, &quot;Well you know, I did pray the other day,&quot;
											you politely ignore it.
											You move on.
											Because you&#39;ve agreed on 90 percent of things,
											because you have a shared view on so many things,
											and you politely differ.
											And I think that&#39;s what the religious wars of late have ignored.
											They&#39;ve ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.

											AB: Well, one thing that we&#39;re all very suspicious of
											is individual leaders.
											It doesn&#39;t need it.
											What I&#39;ve tried to lay out is a framework
											and I&#39;m hoping that people can just fill it in.
											I&#39;ve sketched a sort of broad framework.
											But wherever you are, as I say, if you&#39;re in the travel industry, do that travel bit.
											If you&#39;re in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.

His newest book is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/pleasuressorrowswork\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work</em></a>. <br /><br />In 2008, de Botton helped start the School of Life in London, a social enterprise determined to make learning and therapy relevant in today&#39;s uptight culture.
