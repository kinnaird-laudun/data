											When my brother called me in December of 1998,
											he said, &quot;The news does not look good.&quot;
											This is him on the screen.
											He&#39;d just been diagnosed with ALS,
											which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.
											It paralyzes you. It starts by killing
											the motor neurons in your spinal cord.
											And you go from being a healthy,
											robust 29-year-old male
											to someone that cannot breathe,
											cannot move, cannot speak.

									<p>
											This has actually been, to me, a gift,
											because we began a journey
											to learn a new way of thinking about life.
											And even though Steven passed away three years ago
											we had an amazing journey as a family.
											We did not even —
											I think adversity is not even the right word.
											We looked at this and we said, &quot;We&#39;re going to do something with this
											in an incredibly positive way.&quot;
											And I want to talk today
											about one of the things that we decided to do,
											which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.
											Because, as we all know here today,
											it doesn&#39;t work very well.
											I want to talk about it in the context of a story.

									<p>
											This is the story of my brother.
											But it&#39;s just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,
											and go to something more.
											&quot;Given my status, what is the best outcome
											I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?&quot;
											is what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.
											And those questions all have variables to them.
											All of our statuses are different.
											All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish,
											is different, and our paths will be different,
											they are all stories.
									</p>

											But it&#39;s a story until we convert it to data
											and so what we do, this concept we had,
											was to take Steven&#39;s status, &quot;What is my status?&quot;
											and go from this concept of walking, breathing,
											and then his hands, speak,
											and ultimately happiness and function.
											So, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man
											on his icon,
											but the rest of them are really what&#39;s important here.
											Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,
											as he was in that pool, he could not walk,
											he could not use his arms — that&#39;s why he had the little floaty things on them,
											did you see those? —
											he was happy. We were at the beach,
											he was raising his son, and he was productive.

									<p>
											And we took this, and we converted it into data.
											But it&#39;s not a data point at that one moment in time.
											It is a data point of Steven in a context.
											Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy,
											as a builder: taller, stronger,
											got all the women, amazing guy.
											Here he is walking down the aisle,
											but he can barely walk now, so it&#39;s impaired.
											And he could still hold his wife&#39;s hand, but he couldn&#39;t do buttons on his clothes,
											can&#39;t feed himself.
											And here he is, paralyzed completely,
											unable to breathe and move, over this time journey.
											These stories of his life, converted to data.
											He renovated my carriage house
											when he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,
											and unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration.

											So, here&#39;s Steven alone, sharing this story in the world.
											And this is the insight, the thing that we are
											excited about,
											because we have gone away from the community that we are,
											the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.
											We need to give to others to be successful.
											So, Steven is sharing this story,
											but he is not alone.
											There are so many other people sharing their stories.
											Not stories in words, but stories in data and words.
											And we convert that information into this structure,
											this understanding, this ability to convert
											those stories into something that is computable,
											to which we can begin to change the way
											medicine is done and delivered.

											We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression,
											Parkinson&#39;s disease, HIV.
											These are not simple, they are not internet scalable;
											they require thought and processes
											to find the meaningful information about the disease.
											So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.
											And I&#39;m going to show you what Patients Like Me,

											Here are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now,
											sharing their stories as data.
											Here is an M.S. patient.
											His name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired
											on cognition, vision, walking, sensation.
											Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient.
											Each of them can have a different characteristic.

											These are why people pray.
											Here is the schedule of how frequently they — it&#39;s a dose.

											This is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network.
											This is about the patients.
											So, how can we take this and bring them a tool
											that they can go back and they can engage the medical system?
											And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,
											&quot;What&#39;s something we can use all the time,

											because hospitals usually block us
											because they believe we are a social network.
											It&#39;s actually the most used feature on the website.
											Doctors actually love this sheet, and they&#39;re actually really engaged.
											So, we went from this story of Steven
											and his history to data, and then back to paper,
											where we went back and engaged the medical care system.
											And here&#39;s another paper.
											This is a journal, PNAS —
											I think it&#39;s the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science
											of the United States of America.
											You&#39;ve seen multiple of these today, when everyone&#39;s bragging about
											the amazing things they&#39;ve done.
											This is a report about a drug called lithium.
											Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,
											that a group in Italy found
											slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.

											Now, we&#39;ll skip the critiques of the paper.
											But the short story is: If you&#39;re a patient,
											you want to be on the blue line.
											You don&#39;t want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.
											Because the blue line is a better line. The red line
											is way downhill, the blue line is a good line.
											So, you know we said — we looked at this, and what I love also
											is that people always accuse these Internet sites
											of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.
											So, this is what happened when PNAS published this.
											Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium.
											Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data
											in a bad publication.
											And they call the Internet irresponsible.
											Here&#39;s the implication of what happens.

											There&#39;s this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil,

											who said, &quot;Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?
											Because I don&#39;t want to wait for the next trial, it&#39;s going to be years.
											I want to know now. Can you help us?&quot;
											So, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.
											We let them share the data and exchange it.
											You know, a data network.
											And they said, you know, &quot;Jamie, PLM,
											can you guys tell us whether this works or not?&quot;
											And we went around and we talked to people,
											and they said, &quot;You can&#39;t run a clinical trial like this. You know?
											You don&#39;t have the blinding, you don&#39;t have data,
											it doesn&#39;t follow the scientific method.
											It&#39;s never going to work. You can&#39;t do it.&quot;

											So, I said, &quot;Okay well we can&#39;t do that. Then we can do something harder.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											I can&#39;t say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,
											but I can say whether it works in Humberto.
											I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over,
											and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine
											that came in Leopard. And we said — because it&#39;s really cool,
											you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer,
											and find everything you&#39;ve lost, and I loved it.
											And I said, &quot;What if we built a time machine for patients,
											except instead of going backwards, we go forwards.
											Can we find out what&#39;s going to happen to you,
											so that you can maybe change it?&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto,
											That&#39;s the Apple background, we stole that because we didn&#39;t have time
											to build our own. This is a real app by the way.
											This is not just graphics.
											And you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring
											their data together. And we bring their histories into it.
											And then we say, &quot;Well how do we line them all up?&quot;
											So, we line them all up so they go together
											around the meaningful points,
											integrated across everything we know about the patient.
											Full information, the entire course of their disease.
											And that&#39;s what is going to happen to Humberto,
											unless he does something.
											And he took lithium, and he went down the line.
											And it works almost every time.

									<p>
											Now, the ones that it doesn&#39;t work are interesting.
											But almost all the time it works.
											It&#39;s actually scary. It&#39;s beautiful.
											So, we couldn&#39;t run a clinical trial, we couldn&#39;t figure it out.
											But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.
											And yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power
											and all the standard deviation. We&#39;ll do that later.
											But here is the answer
											of the mean of the patients that actually decided
											to take lithium.
											These are all the patients that started lithium.
											It&#39;s the Intent to Treat Curve.
											You can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones,
											those are the people in the study in PNAS
											that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones,
											the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn&#39;t want to be.
											And the ones in the middle are all of our patients
											from the start of lithium at time zero,
											going forward, and then going backward.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.
											Terrifyingly accurate matching.
											And going forward, you actually don&#39;t want to be a lithium patient this time.
											You&#39;re actually doing slightly worse — not significantly,
											but slightly worse. You don&#39;t want to be a lithium patient this time.
											But you know, a lot of people dropped out,
											the trial, there is too much drop out.
											Can we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients
											that actually decided to stay on lithium,
											because they were so convinced they were getting better?

									<p>
											We asked our control algorithm,
											are those 69 patients — by the way, you&#39;ll notice
											that&#39;s four times the number of patients in the clinical trial —
											can we look at those patients and say,
											&quot;Can we match them with our time machine
											to the other patients that are just like them,
											and what happens?&quot;
											Even the ones that believed they were getting better
											matched the controls exactly. Exactly.

											just like me,
											and that we had the power to detect that at about
											a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.

											in healthcare, couldn&#39;t find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.

his energy on founding revolutionary healthcare initiatives to help his brother and others like him. ","whylisten":"<p><strong>After finding out that his brother, Stephen, had the terminal illness ALS, Jamie Haywood founded the <a href=\"http://www.als.net/\">ALS Therapy Development Institute</a></strong> in 1999. ALS TDI is the world&rsquo;s first non-profit biotechnology company and accelerated research on the disease by hiring scientists to develop treatments outside of academia and for-profit corporations. They were the first to publish research on the safety of using stem cells in ALS patients.</p><p> In 2005,Jamie and his youngest brother Ben, along with close friend Jeff Cole, built <strong><a href=\"http://www.patientslikeme.com/\">PatientsLikeMe.com</a> to give patients control and access to their healthcare information and compare it to others like them.</strong> Its bold (and somewhat controversial) approach involves aggregating users health info in order to test the effects of particular treatments, bypassing clinical trials. It was named one of &quot;15 companies that will change the world&quot; by CNN Money.<br /><br />Although his brother passed away in the fall of 2006, Jamie continues to serve as chairman of PatientsLikeMe and on the board of directors of ALS TDI. Jamie has raised over $50 million dollars for ALS TDI and was the subject of the biography <em><a href=\"http://www.jonathanweiner.com/keeper.html\">His Brother&rsquo;s Keeper</a></em>, written by Jonathan Weiner. He was also featured in the documentary <em><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/somuchsofast/\">So Much So Fast</a></em>, exploring the development of ALS TDI and the personal story of he and Stephen.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jamie Heywood","tags":["collaboration","community","entrepreneur","health","health care","media","medicine"],"title":"The big idea my brother inspired","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":543770}]}
