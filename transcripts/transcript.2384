											I come to you today to speak of liars,
											lawsuits
											and laughter.
											The first time I heard
about Holocaust denial,
											I laughed.
											Holocaust denial?
											The Holocaust which has
the dubious distinction
											of being the best-documented
genocide in the world?
											Who could believe it didn&#39;t happen?
									</p>

											Think about it.
											For deniers to be right,
											who would have to be wrong?
											Well, first of all, the victims —
											the survivors who have told us
their harrowing stories.
											Who else would have to be wrong?
											The bystanders.
											The people who lived in the myriads
of towns and villages and cities
											on the Eastern front,
											who watched their neighbors
be rounded up —
											men, women, children, young, old —
											and be marched
to the outskirts of the town
											to be shot and left dead in ditches.
											Or the Poles,
											who lived in towns and villages
around the death camps,
											who watched day after day
											as the trains went in filled with people
											and came out empty.

											But above all, who would have to be wrong?
											The perpetrators.
											The people who say, &quot;We did it.
											I did it.&quot;
											Now, maybe they add a caveat.
											They say, &quot;I didn&#39;t have a choice;
I was forced to do it.&quot;
											But nonetheless, they say, &quot;I did it.&quot;
											Think about it.
											In not one war crimes trial
since the end of World War II
											has a perpetrator of any nationality
ever said, &quot;It didn&#39;t happen.&quot;
											Again, they may have said, &quot;I was forced,&quot;
but never that it didn&#39;t happen.
											Having thought that through,
											I decided denial was not
going to be on my agenda;
											I had bigger things to worry about,
to write about, to research,
											and I moved on.

											Fast-forward a little over a decade,
											and two senior scholars —
											two of the most prominent historians
of the Holocaust —
											approached me and said,
											&quot;Deborah, let&#39;s have coffee.
											We have a research idea
that we think is perfect for you.&quot;
											Intrigued and flattered
that they came to me with an idea
											and thought me worthy of it,
											I asked, &quot;What is it?&quot;
											And they said, &quot;Holocaust denial.&quot;
											And for the second time, I laughed.
											Holocaust denial?
											The Flat Earth folks?
											The Elvis-is-alive people?
											I should study them?
											And these two guys said,
											&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re intrigued.
											What are they about?
											What&#39;s their objective?
											How do they manage to get people
to believe what they say?&quot;

											One:
											deniers are wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing.
											They are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis —
											you can decide whether you want
to put a &quot;neo&quot; there or not.
											But when I looked at them,

											swastika-like symbols on the wall,
											Sieg Heil salutes —
											none of that.

											An &quot;Institute for Historical Review.&quot;
											They had a journal — a slick journal —

											The other thing I found —
											many of us have been taught to think
there are facts and there are opinions —

											There are facts,

											Who was David Irving?
											David Irving was a writer
of historical works,

											and virtually all of those works
took the position
											that the Nazis were really not so bad,
											and the Allies were really not so good.
											And the Jews, whatever happened to them,
											they sort of deserved it.
											He knew the documents,
											he knew the facts,

to get this opinion.

											he embraced it with great vigor.

											The reason I laughed also
was this was a man
											who not only was a Holocaust denier,

											Here was a man — and I quote —
											who said, &quot;I&#39;m going to sink
the battleship Auschwitz.&quot;
											Here was a man
											who pointed to the number tattooed
on a survivor&#39;s arm and said,
											&quot;How much money have you made
											from having that number
tattooed on your arm?&quot;
											Here was a man who said,
											&quot;More people died in Senator Kennedy&#39;s car
											at Chappaquiddick
											than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz.&quot;
											That&#39;s an American reference,
but you can look it up.
											This was not a man who seemed
at all ashamed or reticent
											about being a Holocaust denier.

believe him anyway?&quot;
											But here was the problem:
											British law put the onus,

											That meant if I didn&#39;t fight,

											And if he won by default,
											he could then legitimately say,

is a legitimate version.
											Deborah Lipstadt was found
to have libeled me

											There was no plan to murder the Jews,

more than just the story

											Because today,

Lipstadt's research focuses on the development of Holocaust denial and how to fight for the truth in an era marked by \"alternative facts.\"","whylisten":"<p>Dr. Deborah E. Lipstadt, Dorot professor of Holocaust Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, was sued for libel in 1996 by David Irving for having called him a Holocaust denier. After a ten-week trial in London in 2000, in an overwhelming victory for Lipstadt, the judge found Irving to be a &quot;neo-Nazi polemicist&quot; who &quot;perverts&quot; history and engages in &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; discourse. <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> (London) described the trial as having &quot;done for the new century what the Nuremberg tribunals or the Eichmann trial did for earlier generations.&quot; <em>The Times</em> (London) described it as &quot;history has had its day in court and scored a crushing victory.&quot; According to the <em>New York Times</em>, the trial &quot;put an end to the pretense that Mr. Irving is anything but a self-promoting apologist for Hitler.&quot;</p><p>The movie&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4645330/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Denial</em></a>, starring Rachel Weisz and Tom Wilkenson with a screenplay by David Hare, tells the story of this legal battle. &nbsp;It is based on Lipstadt&#39;s book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/0GkN\" target=\"_blank\"><em>History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier</em></a>&nbsp;(Harper Collins, 2006), and recently reissued as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/EsUz4Hz\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Denial</em></a>&nbsp;(Harper Collins, 2016). The film was nominated for a BAFTA as one of the best British films of the year.</p><p>Lipstadt has written most recently&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/JB0W\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Holocaust: An American Understanding</em></a>&nbsp;(Rutgers, 2016), which explores how America has understood and interpreted the Holocaust since 1945.</p><p>Her previous book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/ybrWw\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Eichmann Trial</em></a>, (Schocken/Nextbook, 2011) published in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Eichmann trial, was called by <em>Publisher&#39;s Weekly</em>, &quot;a penetrating and authoritative dissection of a landmark case and its after effects.&quot; The <em>New York Times</em> Book Review described Lipstadt as having &quot;done a great service by &hellip; recovering the event as a gripping legal drama, as well as a hinge moment in Israel&#39;s history and in the world&#39;s delayed awakening to the magnitude of the Holocaust.&quot;</p><p>She has also published&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/g3L0b\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Beyond Belief: The American Press And The Coming Of The Holocaust, 1933-1945</em></a>&nbsp;(Free Press, 1986), which surveys what the American press wrote about the persecution of the Jews in the years 1933-1945. &nbsp;She is currently writing a book, <em>The Antisemitic Delusion: Letters to a Concerned Student</em> which will be published in 2018.</p><p>At Emory, Lipstadt&nbsp;directs the website known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hdot.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HDOT</a>, Holocaust Denial on Trial, which contains a complete archive of the proceedings of Irving v. Penguin UK and Deborah Lipstadt. It also provides answers to frequent claims made by deniers. Lipstadt has won the Emery Williams Teaching Award, and she was selected for the award by alumni as the teacher who had most influenced them.</p><p>Lipstadt was a historical consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,&nbsp;helping design the section of the Museum dedicated to the American Response to the Holocaust. She has held a Presidential appointment to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council (from Presidents Clinton and Obama) and was asked by President George W. Bush to represent the White House at the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.</p><p>Lipstadt has a BA from the City College of New York and an MA and PhD from Brandeis University.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Deborah Lipstadt","tags":["communication","global issues","history","society","humanity","law","violence","war","TEDx","writing"],"title":"Behind the lies of Holocaust denial","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1131460}]}
