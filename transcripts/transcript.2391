											It&#39;s very difficult to remember.
											Which loosely translates
into actually saying
											that all the books of knowledge
that you might read
											and then go ahead
and impart your knowledge
											through innovation,
through creativity, through technology,
											but mankind will never be
the wiser about its future
											unless it is coupled with a sense of love
and compassion for their fellow beings.
											The two and a half alphabets
which form the word &quot;प्रेम,&quot;
											which means &quot;love,&quot;
											if you are able to understand that
											and practice it,
											that itself is enough
to enlighten mankind.
											So I truly believe the future &quot;you&quot;
											has to be a you that loves.
											Otherwise it will cease to flourish.
											It will perish in its own self-absorption.

											So you may use your power
											to build walls
											and keep people outside,
											or you may use it to break barriers
and welcome them in.
											You may use your faith
											to make people afraid
											and terrify them into submission,
											or you can use it
to give courage to people
											so they rise to the greatest
heights of enlightenment.
											You can use your energy
											to build nuclear bombs
and spread the darkness of destruction,
											or you can use it to spread
the joy of light to millions.
											You may filthy up the oceans callously
and cut down all the forests.
											You can destroy the ecology,
											or turn to them with love
											and regenerate life
from the waters and trees.
											You may land on Mars
											and build armed citadels,
											or you may look for life-forms and species
to learn from and respect.
											And you can use
all the moneys we all have earned
											to wage futile wars
											and give guns in the hands
of little children
											to kill each other with,
											or you can use it
											to make more food
											to fill their stomachs with.

											My country has taught me
											the capacity for a human being to love
is akin to godliness.
											It shines forth in a world
											which civilization, I think,
already has tampered too much with.
											In the last few days,
the talks here, the wonderful people
											coming and showing their talent,
											talking about individual achievements,
the innovation, the technology,
											the sciences, the knowledge
we are gaining by being here
											in the presence of TED Talks
and all of you
											are reasons enough
for us to celebrate the future &quot;us.&quot;
											But within that celebration
											the quest to cultivate
our capacity for love and compassion
											has to assert itself,
has to assert itself,
											just as equally.

											So I believe the future &quot;you&quot;

											It&#39;s called a chakra
in India, like a circle.
											It ends where it begins from
to complete itself.
											A you that perceives
time and space differently
											understands both
											your unimaginable

											and your complete unimportance
in the larger context of the universe.
											A you that returns back
											to the original innocence of humanity,
											which loves from the purity of heart,

											A world — really, it has to be a you
