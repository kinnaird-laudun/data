											Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth
											has evaporated over the course
of the last two years.
											We&#39;ve questioned the future of capitalism.
											We&#39;ve questioned the financial industry.
											We&#39;ve looked at our government oversight.
											We&#39;ve questioned where we&#39;re going.
											And yet, at the same time,
											this very well may be
a seminal moment in American history,
											an opportunity for the consumer
to actually take control and guide us
											to a new trajectory in America.

											And the idea is a simple, simple idea,
											which is the fact that the consumer
has moved from a state of anxiety
											to action.
											Consumers who represent 72 percent
of the GDP of America
											have actually started, just like banks
and just like businesses,
											to de-leverage, to unwind
their leverage in daily life,
											to remove themselves
from the liability and risk
											that presents itself as they move forward.

											So, to understand this —
and I&#39;m going to stress this —
											it&#39;s not about the consumer
being in retreat.
											The consumer is empowered.
											To understand this, we&#39;ll step back
and look at what&#39;s happened
											over the last year and a half.
											So if you&#39;ve been gone,
this is the CliffsNotes

											If you&#39;re a mom trying to manage a budget,

											How do you buy?

											In fact, let&#39;s go back and look
at what caused this crisis,
											because the consumer,
all of us, in our daily lives,
											actually contributed
a large part to the problem.
											This is something I call
the 50-20 paradox.
											It took us 50 years
											to reach annual savings ratings
of almost 10 percent.
											Fifty years.
											Do you know what this was right here?
This was World War II.
											Do you know why savings was so high?
											There was nothing to buy,
unless you wanted to buy some rivets.

									<p>
											What happened, though,
over the course of the last 20 years,
											we went from a 10 percent savings rate
to a negative savings rate.
											Because we binged.
											We bought extra-large cars,
supersized everything,
											we bought remedies
for restless leg syndrome.
											All these things together
basically created a factor
											where the consumer drove us
headlong into the crisis
											that we face today.
											The personal debt-to-income ratio
basically went from 65 to 135 percent
											in the span of about 15 years.
											So consumers got over-leveraged.
											And of course our banks did as well,
as did our federal government.

											This is an absolutely staggering chart.
											It shows leverage,
trended out from 1919 to 2009.
											And what you end up seeing
is the whole phenomenon
											that we are actually stepping forth
and basically leveraging
											future education, future children
in our households.

											So if you look at this in the context
of visualizing the bailout,
											what you can see is,
if you stack up dollar bills,
											first of all, 360,000 dollars
											is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.
											But if you stack it up, you see
this amazing, staggering amount of dollars
											that have been put into the system
to fund and bail us out.
											So this is the first 315 billion.
											But I read this fact the other day,
											that one trillion seconds
equals 32,000 years.
											So if you think about that,
											the context, the casualness
with which we talk about
											trillion-dollar bailout here
and trillion there,
											we are stacking ourselves up
for long-term leverage.

											However, consumers have moved.

											What we&#39;re seeing
is an uptake in the savings rate.
											In fact, 11 straight months
of savings have happened

											We&#39;re working our way back up

											Visa now reports that more people
are using debit cards than credit cards.
											So we&#39;re starting to pay for things
with money that we have.
											And we&#39;re starting to be much more careful
about how we save and invest.
											But that&#39;s not really the whole story,

											If you think about the last three decades,
											the consumer has moved
from savvy about marketing in the &#39;90s,
											to gathering all these amazing social
and search tools in this decade.
											But the one thing holding them back
is the ability to discriminate.
											By restricting their demand,

to not just be about more,

											We&#39;re going to explain that right now.
											Based on Y&amp;R&#39;s BrandAsset Valuator,
											proprietary tool of VML
and Young &amp; Rubicam,
											we set out to understand
what&#39;s been happening in the crisis
											with the consumer marketplace.
											We found a couple
of really interesting things.
											We&#39;re going to go
through four value shifts

											The first cultural value shift we see
											is this tendency toward something
we call &quot;liquid life.&quot;
											This is the movement
											from Americans defining
their success on having things
											to having liquidity,
											because the less excess
that you have around you,
											the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.
											As a result, déclassé consumption is in.
											Déclassé consumption is the whole idea
that spending money frivolously
											makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.
											The management principle
is dollars and cents.

											But seriously, we also have
this phenomenon
											on Madison Avenue and in other places,
											where people are actually
walking out of luxury boutiques
											with ordinary, generic paper bags
to hide the brand purchases.
											We see high-end haggling in fashion today,
											high-end haggling
for luxury and real estate.

											and sort of a dismantling of artifice.

											This is a story on the yacht club
that&#39;s all basically blue collar.
											Blue-collar yacht club —
where you can join,
											but you&#39;ve got to work in the boatyard
as condition of membership.
											We also see the trend toward tourism
that&#39;s a little bit more low-key:
											agritourism — going to vineyards
and going to farms.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then we also see this movement
forward from dollars and cents.
											What businesses can do to connect
with these new mindsets
											is really interesting.
											A couple things that are kind of cool.
											One is that Frito-Lay figured out
this liquidity thing with their consumer.
											They found their consumer had more
money at the beginning of the month,
											less at the end of the month.
											So they started to change their packaging:
											larger packs at the beginning
of the month,
											smaller packaging at the end of the month.

											Really interestingly, too,
was the San Francisco Giants.
											They&#39;ve just instituted dynamic pricing.
											It takes into account everything
from the pitcher match-ups,
											to the weather, to the team records,
											in setting prices for the consumer.
											Another quick example of these types
of movements is the rise of Zynga.
											Zynga has risen on the consumer&#39;s desire
											to not want to be locked in to fixed cost.
											Again, this theme is about variable
cost, variable living.
											So micro-payments have become huge.
											And lastly, some people are using Hulu
											as a device to get rid
of their cable bill.
											So, really clever ideas there
that are being taken ahold of

											The second of the four values
is this movement toward
											ethics and fair play.
											We see that play itself out
with empathy and respect.
											The consumer is demanding it.
											And, as a result, businesses
must provide not only value,
											but values.
											Increasingly, consumers are looking
at the culture of the company,
											at their conduct in the marketplace.
											So we see with empathy and respect
											lots of really hopeful things
come out of this recession.
											I&#39;ll give you a few examples.

											One is the rise toward communities
and neighborhoods,
											and increased emphasis on your neighbors
as your support system.
											Also, a wonderful by-product
of a really lousy thing,
											which has been unemployment,
											is a rise in volunteerism
that&#39;s been noted in our country.
											We also see the phenomenon —
some of you may have &quot;boomerang kids&quot; —
											these are &quot;boomerang alumni,&quot;
											where universities are actually
reconnecting with alumni
											and helping them with jobs,
sharing skills and retraining.
											We also talked about character
and professionalism.
											We had this miracle on the Hudson

											The third of the four laws
of post-crisis consumerism
											is about durable living.
											We&#39;re seeing in our data
that consumers are realizing
											this is a marathon, not a sprint.
											They&#39;re digging in and looking
for ways to extract value
											out of every purchase they make.
											Witness the fact that Americans
are holding on to their cars
											longer than ever before:
9.4 years on average, in March.
											A record.
											We also see the fact that libraries
have become a huge resource for America.
											Did you know that 68 percent
of Americans now carry a library card?
											The highest percentage ever
in our nation&#39;s history.

											So what you see in this trend
is also the accumulation of knowledge.
											Continuing education is up.
											Everything is focused
on betterment, training,
											development and moving forward.
											We also see a big DIY movement.
											I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent
of all homes in America
											are actually built by owners.
											That includes cottages and the like,
											but 30 percent.
											People are getting their hands dirty,
rolling up their sleeves.
											They want these skills.

											We see it with the phenomenon of raising
backyard hens, chickens and ducks.
											And when you work out the math,
they say it doesn&#39;t work,
											but the principle is there;
											it&#39;s about being sustainable
and taking care of yourself.
											Then we look at the High Line
in New York City,
											an excellent use of reimagining
existing infrastructure
											for something good,
											which is a brand-new park

											So what brands can do, and companies,
is pay dividends to consumers,
											be a brand that lasts,
											offer transparency,
											promise you&#39;re going to be there
beyond today&#39;s sale.
											Perfect example of that is Patagonia.
											Patagonia&#39;s &quot;Footprint Chronicles&quot;

											They&#39;ve created a consumer collective

											The fourth post-crisis
consumerism that we see
											is this movement
about &quot;return to the fold.&quot;
											It&#39;s incredibly important right now.
											Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.
											It&#39;s now about connecting
to your communities,
											connecting to your social networks.
											In my book, I talked about the fact
											that 72 percent of people trust
what other people say
											about a brand or a company,
											versus 15 percent on advertising.
											So in that respect, cooperative
consumerism has really taken off.
											This is about consumers working
together to get what they want
											out of the marketplace.
											Let&#39;s look at a couple of quick examples.

											The artisanal movement is huge:
											everything about locally
derived products and services,
											supporting your local neighborhoods,
											whether it&#39;s cheeses,
wines and other products.
											Also this rise of local currencies.
											Realizing that it&#39;s difficult
to get loans in this environment,
											you&#39;re doing business
with people you trust
											in your local markets.
											So this rise of local currency
is another really interesting phenomenon.
											And then they did a recent report
I thought was fascinating.
											They actually started, in certain
communities in the United States,
											to publish people&#39;s electricity usage.
											And what they found out is when
that was available for public record,
											the people&#39;s electricity usage
in those communities dropped.

at the idea of cow-pooling,
											which is the whole phenomenon
of consumers organizing together
											to buy meat from organic farms,
that they know is safe and controlled
											in the way that they want it
to be controlled.
											And then there&#39;s this other really
interesting movement in California,
											which is about carrot mobs.
											The traditional thing would be
to boycott, right? Have a stick.

about being a community organizer.

											You actually need to organize it.
											You need to harness it.
You need to give it meaning.
											And there&#39;s lots of really
interesting examples here.
											First is just the rise of the fact
that Zagat&#39;s has actually moved out of
											and diversified from rating restaurants,
											into actually rating health care.
											So what credentials does Zagat&#39;s have?

											So we believe that values-driven spending
will force capitalism to be better:
											it will drive innovation;
											it will make longer-lasting products;
											it will create better,
more intuitive customer service;
											and it will give us the opportunity
to connect with companies
											that share the values that we share.
											So when we look back and step out at this
											and see the beginning of these trends
that we&#39;re seeing in our data,
											we see a very hopeful picture
for the future of America.
