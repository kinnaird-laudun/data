											OK. I am known as Captain Organic
											and that&#39;s a philosophical position
as well as an aesthetic position.
											But today what I&#39;d like to talk
to you about is that love of form
											and how form can touch
people&#39;s soul and emotion.
											Not very long ago,
not many thousands of years ago,
											we actually lived in caves,
											and I don&#39;t think
we&#39;ve lost that coding system.
											We respond so well to form.
											But I&#39;m interested
in creating intelligent form.
											I&#39;m not interested at all in blobism
											or any of that superficial rubbish
that you see coming out as design.
											This artificially induced
consumerism — I think it&#39;s atrocious.

											My world is the world
of people like Amory Lovins,
											Janine Benyus, James Watson.
											I&#39;m in that world,
but I work purely instinctively.
											I&#39;m not a scientist.
I could have been, perhaps,
											but I work in this world
where I trust my instincts.
											So I am a 21st-century
translator of technology
											into products that we use everyday
and relate beautifully and naturally with.
											And we should be developing things —
we should be developing packaging
											for ideas which elevate
people&#39;s perceptions
											and respect for the things
that we dig out of the earth
											and translate into products
for everyday use.
											So, the water bottle.

											I&#39;ll begin with this concept
of what I call DNA.
											DNA: Design, Nature, Art.
											These are the three things
that condition my world.
											Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci,
500 years ago, before photography.
											It shows how observation,
curiosity and instinct
											work to create amazing art.
											Industrial design is the art form
of the 21st century.
											People like Leonardo —
there have not been many —
											had this amazingly instinctive curiosity.
											I work from a similar position.
											I don&#39;t want to sound
pretentious saying that,
											but this is my drawing made
on a digital pad a couple of years ago —
											well into the 21st century,
500 years later.
											It&#39;s my impression of water.
											Impressionism being the most valuable
art form on the planet as we know it:
											100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.

											I use, now, a whole new process.
											A few years ago I reinvented my process
											to keep up with people like Greg Lynn,
Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas —
											all these people that I think
are persevering and pioneering
											with fantastic new ideas
of how to create form.
											This is all created digitally.
											Here you see the machining,
the milling of a block of acrylic.
											This is what I show to the client to say,
&quot;That&#39;s what I want to do.&quot;
											At that point, I don&#39;t know
if that&#39;s possible at all.
											It&#39;s a seductor, but I just feel

											So we go, we look at the tooling.
											We look at how that is produced.
											These are the invisible things
that you never see in your life.
											This is the background noise
of industrial design.
											That is like an Anish Kapoor
flowing through a Richard Serra.
											It is more valuable
than the product in my eyes.
											I don&#39;t have one.
											When I do make some money,
I&#39;ll have one machined for myself.
											This is the final product.
											When they sent it to me,
I thought I&#39;d failed.
											It felt like nothing.
It has to feel like nothing.
											It was when I put the water in
											that I realized that I&#39;d put
a skin on water itself.
											It&#39;s an icon of water itself,
											and it elevates people&#39;s perception
of contemporary design.
											Each bottle is different,
											meaning the water level
will give you a different shape.
											It&#39;s mass individualism
from a single product.
											It fits the hand.
											It fits arthritic hands.
It fits children&#39;s hands.
											It makes the product strong,

from those type of polymers

perhaps, in life.
											Biopolymers, these new
ideas for materials,

											It doesn&#39;t look as cool, does it?
											But I can live up to that.

biopolymers. It&#39;s the future.

											I took this video in Cape Town last year.

is a consequence of innovative thinking.
											When I look at these things,
they look pretty normal to me.
											But these things evolved over many years,
and what we&#39;re trying to do —

employing new technologies with new materials to define new shapes.","whotheyare":"Known as \"Captain Organic,\" Ross Lovegrove embraces nature as the inspiration for his \"fat-free\" design. Each object he creates -- be it bottle, chair, staircase or car -- is reduced to its essential elements. His pieces offer minimal forms of maximum beauty.","whylisten":"<p>Ross Lovegrove is truly a pioneer of industrial design. As founder of Studio X in the Notting Hill area of London, the Welsh-born designer has exuberantly embraced the potential offered by digital technologies. However, <strong>he blends his love of high tech with a belief that the natural world had the right idea all along</strong>: Many of his pieces are inspired by principles of evolution and microbiology. <br /><br />Delightedly crossing categories, Lovegrove has worked for clients as varied as Apple, Issey Miyake, Herman Miller and Airbus, and in 2005 he was awarded the <a href=\"http://www.wtn.net/2005/summit/finalists.html\" target=\"_blank\">World Technology Award for design</a>. His personal artwork has been exhibited at <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MoMA</a>  in New York, the <a href=\"http://www.cnac-gp.fr/Pompidou/Accueil.nsf/Document/HomePage?OpenDocument&amp;L=2\" target=\"_blank\">Pompidou Centre</a>  in Paris and the <a href=\"http://www.designmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Design Museum in London</a>. Lovegrove&#39;s astonishing objects are the result of <strong>an ongoing quest to create forms that, as he puts it, touch people&#39;s soul</strong>.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Ross Lovegrove","tags":["DNA","biology","creativity","design","industrial design","invention","nature","product design","science and art"],"title":"Organic design, inspired by nature","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1128239}]}
