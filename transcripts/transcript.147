											RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody&#39;s interesting.
											I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,
											because I had an apology to make to her.
											I&#39;d had dinner with her about two years ago and I&#39;d —
											she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn&#39;t get it off.
											And I went home to my wife that night
											and she wanted to know why I had another woman&#39;s big,
											massive, big wedding ring on my finger.
											And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler
											and get it cut off.
											So — (Laughter) —
											so apologies to Goldie.

											CA: That&#39;s pretty good.
											So, we&#39;re going to put up some slides
											of some of your companies here.
											You&#39;ve started one or two in your time.
											So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records —
											I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.
											And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?

											RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,
											you can really run any companies.
											I mean, companies are all about finding the right people,
											inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.
											And I just love learning and I&#39;m incredibly inquisitive
											and I love taking on, you know, the status quo
											and trying to turn it upside down.
											So I&#39;ve seen life as one long learning process.
											And if I see — you know, if I fly on somebody else&#39;s airline
											and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn&#39;t,
											21 years ago, then I&#39;d think, well, you know, maybe I can create
											the kind of airline that I&#39;d like to fly on.
											And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.

											CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,
											because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.
											And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.
											I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,
											at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records
											and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,
											and his view was that you were trading, you know,
											the world&#39;s fourth biggest record company

											the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,

											On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which —
											we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.

											And there&#39;s an ancient law that says
											you can&#39;t actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.
											So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest us
											if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.
											We changed it to social diseases
											and people came along with acne and spots,
											but nobody came with VD any more.
											So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.

											the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested
											for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols&#39; album.
											And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.
											And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert
											to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.
											And so I rang up Nottingham University,
											and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.
											And he said, &quot;Look, bollocks is not a — has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.
											It&#39;s actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century.&quot;

											CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.
											And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West
											get so excited about — I mean, they&#39;re used to having an idea,
											getting stuff done, and they believe profoundly
											in their ability to make a difference in the world.
											Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,
											we&#39;ve got to fix this problem and we can do it,
											I&#39;ve got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da —
											here&#39;s the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation
											and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?

											RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we&#39;re actually —
											we&#39;re working with the government on it.
											I mean, Thabo Mbeki&#39;s had his problems with accepting
											HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,
											of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,
											it&#39;s a way of working with him, with his government.
											It&#39;s important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,
											they don&#39;t just go in there and then leave after a few years.
											It&#39;s got to be consistent.
											But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how
											and help governments approach things slightly differently.
											For instance, we&#39;re setting up clinics in Africa
											where we&#39;re going to be giving
											free antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatment
											and free malaria treatment.
											But we&#39;re also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,
											so that people pay for some other aspects.

											CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,

											CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that — as I understand him
											and I&#39;m a total amateur — but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by
											this desire to grow and that&#39;s where they get their fulfillment.
											50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom
											and a search for legacy.
											I mean, it seems like you&#39;re still
											a little bit in the growth phases,
											you&#39;re still doing these incredible new plans.
											How much do you think about legacy,
											and what would you like your legacy to be?

											RB: I don&#39;t think I think too much about legacy.
											I mean, I like to — you know, my grandmother lived to 101,
											so hopefully I&#39;ve got another 30 or 40 years to go.
											No, I just want to live life to its full.
											You know, if I can make a difference,
											I hope to be able to make a difference.
											And I think one of the positive things at the moment is
											you&#39;ve got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,
											who are good friends.
											And, thank God, you&#39;ve got two people
											who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.
											If they had that kind of wealth and they didn&#39;t care about the world,
											it would be very worrying.
											And you know they&#39;re going to make a hell of a difference to the world.
											And I think it&#39;s important
											that people in that kind of position do make a difference.

											CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,
											I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of —
											I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless
											and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.
											And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,
											well, he&#39;s made it. Maybe there is a different way.
											So I would like to thank you for that inspiration,
											and for coming to TED today. Thank you.
											Thank you so much.
