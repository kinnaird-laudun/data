											Now a new generation is opening up the world as well.
											I started studying kids about 15 years ago,

											effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology,
											and at first I thought,
											&quot;My children are prodigies!&quot; (Laughter)
											But then I noticed all their friends were like them,
											so that was a bad theory.
											So I&#39;ve started working with a few hundred kids,
											and I came to the conclusion
											that this is the first generation to come of age
											in the digital age,
											to be bathed in bits.
											I call them the Net Generation.
											I said, these kids are different.
											They have no fear of technology, because it&#39;s not there.
											It&#39;s like the air.

											The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well.
											Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age,

											government, media, Wall Street,
											are in various stages of being stalled or frozen
											or in atrophy or even failing,

											He takes over this gold mine, and his geologists
											can&#39;t tell him where the gold is.
											He gives them more money for geological data,
											they come back, they can&#39;t tell
											him where to go into production.
											After a few years, he&#39;s so frustrated he&#39;s ready

											He wonders, &quot;If my geologists don&#39;t know where the gold is,
											maybe somebody else does.&quot;
											So he does a &quot;radical&quot; thing.
											He takes his geological data,
											he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet
											called the Goldcorp Challenge.
											It&#39;s basically half a million dollars in prize money

											an age of promise fulfilled
											and of peril unrequited.
