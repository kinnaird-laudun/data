											When you think about resilience and technology it&#39;s actually much easier.
											You&#39;re going to see some other speakers today, I already know,
											who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,
											and, of course, with technology it never is.
											So it&#39;s very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.
											I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,
											with such an incredible last half a dozen years,
											that it&#39;s hard to even get the right analogy for it.
											A lot of how we decide, how we&#39;re supposed to react to things
											and what we&#39;re supposed to expect about the future
											depends on how we bucket things
											and how we categorize them.

											And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust
											that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.
											It&#39;s easy to think of this analogy as very different
											from some of the other things you might pick.
											For one thing, both were very real.
											In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million
											worth of gold out of California. It was very real.
											The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to
											communicate with each other. It&#39;s a big deal.
											Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.
											You keep going, and both things are lots of hype.
											I don&#39;t have to remind you of all the hype
											that was involved with the Internet — like GetRich.com.

											But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. &quot;Gold. Gold. Gold.&quot;
											Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.
											Some have 5,000. Many have more.
											A few bring out 100,000 dollars each.
											People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.
											&quot;The Eldorado of the United States of America:
											the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California.&quot;
											And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.
											So many people left what they were doing.
											And what would happen is — and the Gold Rush went on for years.

											People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,
											they thought, &quot;Ah, this isn&#39;t real.&quot;
											But they keep hearing about people getting rich,
											and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it&#39;s not real.
											By about 1852, they&#39;re thinking, &quot;Am I the stupidest person on Earth
											by not rushing to California?&quot; And they start to decide they are.
											These are community affairs, by the way.
											Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams
											of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,
											and they would form companies.
											These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,
											if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,
											no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.

											This guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole,

											They would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,
											and then take another ship north.
											This guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.
											This has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.
											These are both very successful — a physician in one case,

											In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.
											The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak
											because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon
											to go search for gold.
											So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.
											They turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn&#39;t sail them anywhere.
											You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever.
											And you saw some of the excesses
											that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.
											The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.
											Half of them deserted to go look for gold.
											And they wouldn&#39;t let the other half out to go look for the first half
											because they were afraid they wouldn&#39;t come back.

											They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate.
											This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail.

											And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time:
											&quot;Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,
											sometimes in bunches under the cliffs,
											with pack saddles and packs where they&#39;ve fallen from the rock above,
											sometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes
											and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,
											often, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,
											a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches
											turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.
											The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere
											account for the myriads of ravens along the road.
											The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to,
											the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone,
											cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described.&quot;

											Here&#39;s this guy: &quot;There are many men in Dawson

											And that was, of course, the very common story.
											Because when you take out that last piece of gold —
											and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush —
											the entire American river region, within two years —
											every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies
											who used more sophisticated mining technologies
											started to take gold out of there.
											So there&#39;s a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic
											and that analogy is the electric industry.
											And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.
											With the electric industry you actually have to —
											one of them is that they&#39;re both sort of thin,
											horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.
											It&#39;s not a specific thing.

											But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.
											You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.
											It&#39;s an incredible means of coordinating,
											in a very fine-grained way, information flows.
											There&#39;s a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.
											And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on
											is sort of the golden age of appliances.
											The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.
											So the light bulb is what wired the world.
											And they weren&#39;t thinking about appliances when they wired the world.
											They were really thinking about —
											they weren&#39;t putting electricity into the home;
											they were putting lighting into the home.
											And, but it really — it got the electricity. It took a long time.

											This was a huge — as you would expect — a huge capital build out.
											All the streets had to be torn up.
											This is work going on down in lower Manhattan
											where they built some of the first electric power generating stations.
											And they&#39;re tearing up all the streets.
											The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,
											which became General Electric,
											paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.
											But that is not the — and that&#39;s not the part that&#39;s really most similar to the Web.
											Because, remember, the Web got to stand
											on top of all this heavy infrastructure
											that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.
											So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure —
											I&#39;m going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,
											when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.
											How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994
											when people weren&#39;t really investing in the Web?
											Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.

											So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure,
											and then home appliances started coming into being.
											And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan —

											And the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted —
											it depends how you want to measure it —
											but it&#39;s anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.
											It starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success.

											I don&#39;t know why. But I thought, you know,

											So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this.

											Now, the toaster was huge
											because they used to make toast on open fires,
											and it took a lot of time and attention.
											I want to point out one thing. This is — you guys know what this is.
											They hadn&#39;t invented the electric socket yet.
											So this was — remember, they didn&#39;t wire the houses for electricity.
											They wired them for lighting. So your — your appliances would plug in.
											They would — each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top.
											And you&#39;d plug it in there.

											In fact, if you&#39;ve seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World,
											you&#39;ve seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.
											All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb
											if you wanted to plug in an appliance.
											The next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.
											Now, this was an object of much envy and lust.
											Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.
											On the left-hand side, this was the soapy water.
											And there&#39;s a rotor there — that this motor is spinning.
											And it would clean your clothes.
											This is the clean rinse-water. So you&#39;d take the clothes out of here,
											put them in here, and then you&#39;d run the clothes through this electric wringer.
											And this was a big deal.
											You&#39;d keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.
											And you&#39;d run a long cord into the house
											where you could screw it into your light socket.

											And that&#39;s actually kind of an important point in my presentation,
											because they hadn&#39;t invented the off switch.
											That was to come much later — the off switch on appliances —
											because it didn&#39;t make any sense.
											I mean, you didn&#39;t want this thing clogging up a light socket.
											So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.
											That&#39;s what you did. You didn&#39;t turn it off.
											And as I said before, they hadn&#39;t invented the electric outlet either,
											so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.
											And there are —
											when you research this, there are gruesome descriptions

It&#39;s the standard by which all web businesses are now judged -- if not by their shareholders, then by their customers. Amazon set a high bar for reliability and customer service, and also <strong>introduced a wide range of online retail conventions -- from user reviews and one-click shopping to the tab interface and shopping cart icon</strong> -- so commonplace we no longer think of them as once having been innovations.<br /><br />When the Internet bubble burst, Amazon.com took a hit with the other e-commerce pioneers, but the fundamentally sound company hung tough.<strong> It now sells more than $10 billion a year of goods, profitably</strong>, and its technology will influence the changes to business and media that will come next. Amazon recently released Kindle, a wireless digital reading device, giving the term &quot;page turning&quot; a completely new definition. Bezos, meanwhile, is one of the few early Web CEOs who still run the companies they founded.
