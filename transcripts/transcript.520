											I&#39;m a storyteller.
											And I would like to tell you
a few personal stories
											about what I like to call
&quot;the danger of the single story.&quot;
											I grew up on a university campus
in eastern Nigeria.
											My mother says that I started
reading at the age of two,
											although I think four
is probably close to the truth.
											So I was an early reader,
											and what I read were British
and American children&#39;s books.

									<p>
											I was also an early writer,
											and when I began to write,
at about the age of seven,
											stories in pencil
with crayon illustrations
											that my poor mother was obligated to read,
											I wrote exactly the kinds
of stories I was reading:
											All my characters were
white and blue-eyed,
											they played in the snow,
											they ate apples,

account of his voyage.

											of a tradition of telling
African stories in the West:

of this single story,

was not &quot;authentically African.&quot;
											Now, I was quite willing to contend

wrong with the novel,
											that it had failed in a number of places,

that it had failed
											at achieving something
called African authenticity.
											In fact, I did not know
what African authenticity was.
											The professor told me that my characters
were too much like him,

											My characters drove cars.

											A few years ago,
I visited Mexico from the U.S.

											I realized that I had been so immersed

											Shortly after he published my first novel,
											I went to a TV station
in Lagos to do an interview,
											and a woman who worked there
as a messenger came up to me and said,
											&quot;I really liked your novel.
I didn&#39;t like the ending.
											Now, you must write a sequel,
and this is what will happen ...&quot;

											And she went on to tell me
what to write in the sequel.
											I was not only charmed, I was very moved.
											Here was a woman, part of the ordinary
masses of Nigerians,
											who were not supposed to be readers.
											She had not only read the book,
											but she had taken ownership of it
											and felt justified in telling me
what to write in the sequel.

about my friend Funmi Iyanda,

a TV show in Lagos,

in English and Pidgin,
											and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,

											to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.

											Every time I am home I am confronted

for most Nigerians:
											our failed infrastructure,
our failed government,

how many people apply,

											The American writer
Alice Walker wrote this
