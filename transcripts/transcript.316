											This is very strange for me, because I’m not used to doing this:
											I usually stand on the other side of the light,
											and now I&#39;m feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it&#39;s hard ...
											The previous speaker has, I think,
											really painted a very good background as to
											the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,
											and trying to find the answer to the big questions.

											But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this,
											feels like — there’s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti,
											who after many years of living in France — and learning, you know,
											studying and working — he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?
											What have you done with so many years of being away?
											And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.
											And obviously they were, &quot;Is this what you spent years doing?
											And we expected huge masterpieces!&quot;
											But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces
											was the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything —
											just in a reduced, small version.
											In a way, I feel like that.
											I feel like I’m coming home to talk about
											what I’ve been away doing for 20 years.
											And I will start with a brief taster of what I’ve been about:
											a handful of films — nothing much,
											two feature films and a handful of short films.
											So, we’ll go with the first piece.

											Boy: My fuckin&#39; reality.

											Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.
											Marcus: With an AK-47?
											Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin&#39; right.
											Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?

											Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is
											totally trying to capture what cinema is for me,
											and where I&#39;m coming from in terms of cinema.
											The first piece was, really, there&#39;s a young woman talking about Nigeria,
											that she has a feeling she&#39;ll be happy there.
											These are the sentiments of someone that&#39;s been away from home.
											And that was something that I went through, you know, and I&#39;m still going through.
											I&#39;ve not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.
											I&#39;ve been away 20 years in total.
											And so it’s really —
											it&#39;s really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997,
											which is the time of Abacha — the military dictatorship,
											the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.
											So, for this girl to have these dreams
											is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.
											How — and it&#39;s sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful,
											because you just need something to hold on to,
											especially in a society where you feel alienated.

											Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man
											talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,
											the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,
											and his reality.
											Again, this was my — this was me talking about —
											this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom,
											and there was this buzzword — and it was trying to say,
											what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?
											And what would a child —
											what does a child like Jamie — the young boy — think,
											I mean, with all this anger that&#39;s built up inside of him?
											What happens with that?
											What, of course, happens with that is violence,
											which we see when we talk about the ghettos
											and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,
											and which eventually, when channeled, becomes,
											you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots —
											like the one in France two years ago, where I live,
											which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, &quot;Oh well,
											France is a liberal society.&quot;
											But I lived in England for 18 years.
											I&#39;ve lived in France for about four, and I feel actually
											thrown back 20 years, living in France.
											And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question:
											What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?
											There&#39;s a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends —
											fellow filmmakers — talking about what cinema means.
											I suppose that will take me to my last piece —
											what cinema means for me.
											My life started as a — I started life in 1966,
											a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years
											and it was three years of war.
											So that whole thing,
											that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.

											E: We were fighting for our freedom.
											If killing in a war is a crime,
											then you have to charge every soldier in the world.
											War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.
											You too are a retired General, not so?
											CC: Yes, correct.
											E: So you too must stand trial then.
											Our government was corrupt.
											Lack of education was their way to control power.
											If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?
											CC: No, we don’t.
											E: You are richer than us.
											But we pay for school.
											Your country talks about democracy,
											but you support corrupt governments like my own.
											Why? Because you want our diamond.
											Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?
											No.
											CC: Mr. Gelehun, I&#39;d like to remind you, you&#39;re not on trial here today.
											You are not on trial.
											E: Then let me go.

											One of the themes that comes through very strongly
											in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young
											that have to play this role of being child soldiers.
											And considering where you are coming from,
											and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously
											as it should be, what would you have to say about that?

											NA: In the process of my research, I actually spent
											a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.
											And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers —
											ex-combatants, as they like to be called.
											I met psychosocial workers who worked with them.
											I met psychiatrists who spent time with them,
											aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.
											But I remember on the flight back on my last trip,
											I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself,
											if any kid in the West, in the western world,
											went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through,
											they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.
											So for me, the thought that we have all these children —
											it’s a generation, we have a whole generation of children —
											who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage,
											and Africa has to live with that.
											But I’m just saying to factor that in,
											factor that in with all this great advancement,
											all this pronouncement of great achievement.
											That’s really my thinking.
