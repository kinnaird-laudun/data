<title>Emma Marris: Nature is everywhere -- we just need to learn to see it | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How do you define &quot;nature?&quot; If we define it as that which is untouched by humans, then we won&#39;t have any left, says environmental writer Emma Marris. She urges us to consider a new definition of nature -- one that includes not only pristine wilderness but also the untended patches of plants growing in urban spaces -- and encourages us to bring our children out to touch and tinker with it, so that one day they might love and protect it." />

<meta content='How do you define "nature?" If we define it as that which is untouched by humans, then we won&#x0027;t have any left, says environmental writer Emma Marris. She urges us to consider a new definition of nature — one that includes not only pristine wilderness but also the untended patches of plants growing in urban spaces — and encourages us to bring our children out to touch and tinker with it, so that one day they might love and protect it.' itemprop='description'>

											We are stealing nature from our children.
											Now, when I say this, I don&#39;t mean
that we are destroying nature
											that they will have wanted us to preserve,
											although that is
unfortunately also the case.
											What I mean here is that we&#39;ve started
to define nature in a way
											that&#39;s so purist and so strict
											that under the definition
we&#39;re creating for ourselves,
											there won&#39;t be any nature
left for our children
											when they&#39;re adults.
											But there&#39;s a fix for this.
											So let me explain.

											Right now, humans use half of the world
											to live, to grow their crops
and their timber,
											to pasture their animals.
											If you added up all the human beings,
											we would weigh 10 times as much
as all the wild mammals put together.
											We cut roads through the forest.
											We have added little plastic particles
to the sand on ocean beaches.
											We&#39;ve changed the chemistry of the soil
with our artificial fertilizers.
											And of course, we&#39;ve changed
the chemistry of the air.
											So when you take your next breath,
											you&#39;ll be breathing in
42 percent more carbon dioxide
											than if you were breathing in 1750.
											So all of these changes, and many others,
											have come to be kind of lumped together
under this rubric of the &quot;Anthropocene.&quot;
											And this is a term
that some geologists are suggesting
											we should give to our current epoch,
											given how pervasive
human influence has been over it.
											Now, it&#39;s still just a proposed epoch,
but I think it&#39;s a helpful way
											to think about the magnitude
of human influence on the planet.

											So 25 years ago, environmental writer
Bill McKibben said
											that because nature
was a thing apart from man
											and because climate change meant
											that every centimeter of the Earth
was altered by man,
											then nature was over.
											In fact, he called his book
&quot;The End of Nature.&quot;

											I disagree with this.
I just disagree with this.
											I disagree with this definition of nature,
because, fundamentally, we are animals.
											Right? Like, we evolved on this planet
											in the context of all the other animals
with which we share a planet,
											and all the other plants,
and all the other microbes.
											And so I think that nature
											is not that which is untouched
by humanity, man or woman.
											I think that nature
is anywhere where life thrives,
											anywhere where there are
multiple species together,
											anywhere that&#39;s green and blue
and thriving and filled with life
											and growing.
											And under that definition,
											things look a little bit different.

											Now, I understand that there
are certain parts of this nature
											that speak to us in a special way.
											Places like Yellowstone,
											or the Mongolian steppe,
											or the Great Barrier Reef
											or the Serengeti.
											Places that we think of
as kind of Edenic representations
											of a nature before
we screwed everything up.
											And in a way, they are less impacted
by our day to day activities.
											Many of these places
have no roads or few roads,
											so on, like such.
											But ultimately, even these Edens
are deeply influenced by humans.

											Now, let&#39;s just take
North America, for example,
											since that&#39;s where we&#39;re meeting.
											So between about 15,000 years ago
when people first came here,
											they started a process
of interacting with the nature
											that led to the extinction
of a big slew of large-bodied animals,
											from the mastodon
to the giant ground sloth,
											saber-toothed cats,
											all of these cool animals
that unfortunately are no longer with us.
											And when those animals went extinct,
											you know, the ecosystems
didn&#39;t stand still.
											Massive ripple effects
changed grasslands into forests,
											changed the composition of forest
from one tree to another.
											So even in these Edens,
											even in these perfect-looking places
											that seem to remind us
of a past before humans,
											we&#39;re essentially looking
at a humanized landscape.
											Not just these prehistoric humans,
but historical humans, indigenous people
											all the way up until the moment
when the first colonizers showed up.
											And the case is the same
for the other continents as well.
											Humans have just been involved in nature
											in a very influential way
for a very long time.

I was just there.
											It&#39;s awesome. National Geographic
sent me to Manú National Park,
											which is in the Peruvian Amazon,
											but it&#39;s a big chunk of rainforest,
uncleared, no roads,
											protected as a national park,
											one of the most, in fact,
biodiverse parks in the world.
											And when I got in there with my canoe,
what did I find, but people.
											People have been living there
for hundreds and thousands of years.
											People live there, and they don&#39;t
just float over the jungle.
											They have a meaningful relationship
with the landscape.
											They hunt. They grow crops.
											They domesticate crops.
											They use the natural resources
to build their houses,
											to thatch their houses.
											They even make pets out of animals
that we consider to be wild animals.
											These people are there

											Now, I was with
an anthropologist on this trip,
											and he told me, as we were
floating down the river,
											he said, &quot;There are
no demographic voids in the Amazon.&quot;
											This statement has really stuck with me,
											because what it means
is that the whole Amazon is like this.
											There&#39;s people everywhere.
											And many other
tropical forests are the same,
											and not just tropical forests.
											People have influenced
ecosystems in the past,

to influence them in the present,

they&#39;re harder to notice.

											So, if all of the definitions of nature
that we might want to use

											if all of those actually give us
a result where we don&#39;t have any nature,

											Now, if we do it that way,
											what do we get?
											Well, it&#39;s this kind of miracle.
											All of a sudden,
there&#39;s nature all around us.
											All of a sudden,
we see this Monarch caterpillar
											munching on this plant,
											and we realize that there it is,
											and it&#39;s in this empty lot in Chattanooga.
											And look at this empty lot.
											I mean, there&#39;s, like, probably,
											a dozen, minimum,
plant species growing there,
											supporting all kinds of insect life,
											and this is a completely unmanaged space,
a completely wild space.
											This is a kind of wild nature

											And there&#39;s an interesting
little paradox, too.
											So this nature,
											this kind of wild, untended part
											of our urban, peri-urban,
suburban agricultural existence
											that flies under the radar,
											it&#39;s arguably more wild
than a national park,
											because national parks
are very carefully managed
											in the 21st century.
											Crater Lake in southern Oregon,
which is my closest national park,
											is a beautiful example of a landscape
that seems to be coming out of the past.
											But they&#39;re managing it carefully.
											One of the issues they have now
is white bark pine die-off.
											White bark pine
is a beautiful, charismatic —
											I&#39;ll say it&#39;s a charismatic megaflora
											that grows up at high altitude —
											and it&#39;s got all these problems
right now with disease.
											There&#39;s a blister rust
that was introduced,
											bark beetle.
											So to deal with this,
the park service has been planting
											rust-resistant white bark
pine seedlings in the park,
											even in areas that they are
otherwise managing as wilderness.
											And they&#39;re also putting out
beetle repellent in key areas
											as I saw last time I went hiking there.
											And this kind of thing is really
much more common than you would think.
											National parks are heavily managed.
											The wildlife is kept to a certain
population size and structure.
											Fires are suppressed.
											Fires are started.
											Non-native species are removed.
											Native species are reintroduced.
											And in fact, I took a look,
											and Banff National Park
is doing all of the things I just listed:
											suppressing fire, having fire,
											radio-collaring wolves,
reintroducing bison.
											It takes a lot of work to make
these places look untouched.

											Which means that they&#39;re
the absolute worst places
											to take your children on vacation,

											That&#39;s maybe what we want to do as adults,

											Additionally, these sort of Edenic places

											And they&#39;re expensive to get to.
They&#39;re hard to visit.
											So this means that they&#39;re
only available to the elites,
											and that&#39;s a real problem.
											The Nature Conservancy
did a survey of young people,
											and they asked them, how often
do you spend time outdoors?
											And only two out of five
spent time outdoors
											at least once a week.
											The other three out of five
were just staying inside.
											And when they asked them why,
what are the barriers to going outside,

of a city park.

											So here&#39;s an example: Philadelphia.
											There&#39;s this cool elevated railway
											that you can see from the ground,
that&#39;s been abandoned.
											Now, this may sound like the beginning
of the High Line story in Manhattan,
											and it&#39;s very similar, except they haven&#39;t
developed this into a park yet,
											although they&#39;re working on it.
											So for now, it&#39;s still this little
sort of secret wilderness
											in the heart of Philadelphia,
											and if you know where the hole is
in the chain-link fence,
											you can scramble up to the top
											and you can find this
completely wild meadow
											just floating above
the city of Philadelphia.
											Every single one of these plants
grew from a seed
											that planted itself there.
											This is completely autonomous,
self-willed nature.
											And it&#39;s right in the middle of the city.
											And they&#39;ve sent people up there
to do sort of biosurveys,
											and there are over 50
plant species up there.
											And it&#39;s not just plants.
											This is an ecosystem,
a functioning ecosystem.
											It&#39;s creating soil.
It&#39;s sequestering carbon.
											There&#39;s pollination going on.

											So scientists have started calling
ecosystems like these &quot;novel ecosystems,&quot;

dominated by non-native species,
											and because they&#39;re just super weird.
											They&#39;re just unlike anything
we&#39;ve ever seen before.
											For so long, we dismissed
all these novel ecosystems as trash.
											We&#39;re talking about
regrown agricultural fields,
											timber plantations that are not
being managed on a day-to-day basis,
											second-growth forests generally,
the entire East Coast,
											where after agriculture moved west,
the forest sprung up.
											And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii,
											where novel ecosystems are the norm,
											where exotic species totally dominate.
											This forest here has Queensland maple,
											it has sword ferns from Southeast Asia.
											You can make your own
novel ecosystem, too.
