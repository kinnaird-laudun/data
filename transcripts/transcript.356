											Sixty-five million years ago, a very important
											and catastrophic event
											changed the course of life on land.
											And although we know that the land animals I&#39;m going to talk about
											are just the scum of the Earth on the land —
											the little bits of land floating around — but they are important to us
											because they&#39;re sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters.
											And these animals disappeared,
											and a separate life, mammals,
											radiated out to take their place. And so, we know this
											in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core
											from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis, the earthquakes,
											and the things that we&#39;ve experienced
											in the entire record of humankind history
											can&#39;t really quite get around the kind of disaster
											that this represented for the Earth.

									<p>
											So even before that impact was known,
											even before scientists in general came to an agreement
											over the theory of evolution,
											scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes
											actually had divided Earth&#39;s life&#39;s history
											into these two episodes:
											Mesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life.
											And as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely
											with geologic history.
											So we have a Mesozoic period,
											an age of fragmentation,
											and a Cenozoic period, an age of reconnection —
											South America to North America, India to Asia.
											And so my work, really, is trying to understand
											the character of that Mesozoic radiation
											compared to the Cenozoic radiation
											to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals
											about what life on drifting continents
											really can tell us about evolution.

											The work immediately begs the question,
											&quot;Why didn&#39;t they go into the waters?&quot;
											I mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example.
											You can go outside — see many other examples.
											Within five, 10 million years of the bolide impact
											we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn&#39;t they do that?
											Why didn&#39;t they hang around in trees at good size,
											and why didn&#39;t they burrow?
											Why didn&#39;t they do all these things, and if they didn&#39;t do all these things,
											what kinds of animals were in those spaces?
											And if there were no animals in those spaces, what does that tell us
											about, you know, how evolution works on land?
											Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size.
											In fact, I think that most of it has to do with body size —
											the size you are when you inherit
											a vacant ecospace
											from whatever natural disaster.

											Looking at dinosaur evolution
											and studying it, digging it up for many years,
											I end up looking at the mammal radiation,
											and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology,
											advancing by an order of magnitude.
											Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace,
											an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.
											You want to measure it by diversity?
											You want to measure it by
											the time it took to reach maximum body size?
											Yes, they do have larger body size,
											but many of them are smaller,
											but we&#39;re interested in the time it took them to achieve that.
											Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size.
											And that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals
											to achieve maximum body size
											and invade all those habitats.

											So there&#39;s lessons to learn,
											and there&#39;s lessons to learn from the exception,
											the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we&#39;ve made,
											and many other scholars have made around the world.
											This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx.
											We now know this transition is the one time
											that dinosaurs actually went below
											that body size —
											we&#39;re going to see where they began in a minute —
											and it is the one time that they rapidly
											invaded all the habitats
											I just told you that dinosaurs weren&#39;t in.
											They became marine. We now know them today
											from the ice caps.
											There&#39;s burrowing birds.
											They inhabit the trees at all body sizes,
											and, of course, they inhabit the land.

											So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series
											that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature.
											We called this bird Sinornis. It&#39;s a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx,
											and if you go to different layers, you find things
											that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx, and every grade in between,


											so that if you find something today, we&#39;re usually splitting hairs —
											or, more appropriately, feathers — as to decide whether it&#39;s actually
											a non-avian or an avian.
											It is the greatest transition that we have, actually,
											on land from one habitat to another,
											bar none,
											to understand how a bony,
											fairly heavy, kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal
											could make such a transition.
											It is really our greatest — one of our greatest — evolutionary sequences.

									<p>
											Now, my work began at the beginning.
											I thought if I&#39;m going to understand dinosaur evolution,
											I&#39;d have to go back to those beds
											where they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place
											where the earliest dinosaurs existed.
											I&#39;d like to call for this little video clip
											to give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions:
											&quot;Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?&quot;
											If we could roll that first video clip.
											This is sort of a nice helicopter ride
											through those early beds,
											and they&#39;re located in Northeastern Argentina.
											And we&#39;re coming over a cliff, and at the top of that cliff,
											dinosaurs had basically taken over.
											At the bottom of the cliff, we find that they&#39;re rare as hens&#39; teeth.
											That&#39;s where dinosaur origins is to be found: at the bottom of the cliff.

											And the rest is up to you. You&#39;ve got to find fossils.
											You&#39;ve got to dig a hole that&#39;s usually quite a bit bigger than that
											to get it out; you&#39;ve got to climb those cliffs
											and find, really, everything that existed —
											not just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you&#39;re lucky,
											and you dig a place like that,
											you actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did.
											228 million years old, we found
											what really is the most primitive dinosaur:
											that&#39;s the Ur-dinosaur.
											A three-and-a-half foot thing,
											beautiful skull, predator,
											meat-eater, a two-legged animal.
											So, all the other dinosaurs that you know,
											or your kids know, at least, on four legs.
											This is sort of a look at the skull,
											and it&#39;s an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.
											It looks rather bird-like because it is.
											It&#39;s bird-like and hollow.
											A predator. Maybe 25 pounds,
											or 10 kilograms.
											That&#39;s where dinosaurs began. That&#39;s where the radiation began.
											That is 10 times larger
											than the mammal radiation, which was a four-legged radiation.
											We are extremely dinosaur-like,
											and unusual in our two-legged approach to life.

											Now, if you want to understand what happened
											then when the continents broke apart,
											and dinosaurs found — landlubbers, as they are —
											found themselves adrift. There&#39;s some missing puzzle pieces.
											Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents,

											This is a ceremonial disk.
											An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara
											5,000 years ago is been sitting out there
											waiting for us to go back. So, really exciting.
											And then work later is going to take us to Tibet.
											Now, we normally think of Tibet as a highland.
											It&#39;s really an island continent.
											It was a precursor to India,
											a messenger from Gondwana —
											a lost paradise of dinosaurs 


											isolated for millions of years.
											No one&#39;s found them. We know where they are,

											They&#39;re only between 13 and 14,000 feet,
											but if you go in the warm part of the year, it&#39;s O.K.
											Now, I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history
											so that we can try to understand
											some basic patterns of evolution.
											I&#39;ve talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further.
											We need to delve into this mass of anatomy
											that we&#39;ve been compiling
											to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means.
											We can&#39;t predict, necessarily, what will happen in evolution,

											With regard to the biogeographic question,
											the Earth is dividing.
											These are all landlubbing animals. There&#39;s a couple of choices.
											You get divided, and a continent&#39;s division
											corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree,
											or you&#39;re crafty, and you manage to escape
											from one to the other and erase that division,
											or you&#39;re living peacefully on each side,
											and on one side you just go extinct,
											and you survive on the other side and create a difference.
											And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other
											of those three things, but the paleontologist never found you.
											And you take those four instances
											and you realize you have a complex problem.
											And so, in addition to digging, I think we have some answers
											from the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated —
											we call it dispersal — around the globe, with the slightest land bridge.
											They did it within two or three degrees of the pole,
											to maintain similarity between continents.
											But when they were divided, indeed they were divided,
											and we do see the continents
											carving differences among dinosaurs.

									<p>
											But there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s even more important, and I think that&#39;s extinction.
											We have downgraded this factor.
											It carves up the history of life,
											and gives us the differences that we see
											in the dinosaur world towards the end,
											right before the bolide impact.
											The best way to test this is to actually create a model.
											So if we move back, this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life.
											I want to give you three dimensions.
											So you see the tree of life,
											but now I&#39;ve added the dimension of area.
											So the tree of life is normally divergence over time.

											Now we have divergence over time, but we&#39;ve created the third dimension of area.

											going from one area to another.
											And ultimately we can control the branching
											to mimic what we think the continents were like,
											and run it a thousand times, so we can estimate the parameters,

											or somebody helps us do that, because that would be an incredible thing for their country.
											But when we look back at our own country, we&#39;re looking back at our cities,
											the cities where most of you come from — certainly the city I come from —
											there&#39;s legions of kids out there
											like these.
											And the question is — and we started to address this question for centuries —
											as to how we get these kids involved in science.

									<p>
											We&#39;ve started in Chicago
											an organization — a non-profit organization —
											called Project Exploration.
											These are two kids from Project Exploration.
											We met them in their early stages in high school. They were —
											failing to poor students,
											and they are now — one at the University of Chicago, another in Illinois.
											We&#39;ve got students at Harvard. We&#39;re six years old.
											And we created a track record.
											Because when you go out there as a scholar, and you try to find out longitudinal studies,
											track records like that, there essentially are very few, if none.
											So, we&#39;ve created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation,
											90 percent going to college, many first-generation,
											90 percent of those choosing science as a career.
											It&#39;s an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say,
											well, we didn&#39;t really exactly work this out theoretically from the start,
											but when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											It&#39;s gone through science as an inquiry,
											which was a big advance,
											and Dewey back at Chicago —
											you learn by doing.
											To — you learn by envisioning yourself
											as a scientist,
											and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist.
											The next step is to learn the capability
											to make yourself a scientist.
											You have to have those steps. If you have —
											It&#39;s easy to get kids interested in science.
											It&#39;s hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist,
											which involves standing up in front of people like we&#39;re doing here at this symposium
											and presenting something as a knowledgeable person,
											and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist
											and giving yourself the tools to pursue that.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so, that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do. We&#39;re planning a permanent home in Chicago.
											We have lots of ideas, but I guarantee you this one thing —
											and I&#39;ve talked to some people here at TED —
											it&#39;s not going to look like anything you&#39;ve seen before.
											It&#39;s going to be part-school, part-museum hall,
											part-conservatory, part-zoo,
											and part of an answer to the problem
											of how you interest kids in science.
											Thank you very much.
