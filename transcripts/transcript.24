											I&#39;d like to talk today
about the two biggest social trends
											in the coming century,
											and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
											But I want to start
with my work on romantic love,
											because that&#39;s my most recent work.
											What I and my colleagues did was put
32 people, who were madly in love,
											into a functional MRI brain scanner.
											17 who were madly in love
and their love was accepted;
											and 15 who were madly in love
and they had just been dumped.
											And so I want to tell you
about that first,
											and then go on into where
I think love is going.

											&quot;What &#39;tis to love?&quot; Shakespeare said.
											I think our ancestors —
											I think human beings have been
wondering about this question
											since they sat around their campfires
											or lay and watched
the stars a million years ago.
											I started out by trying to figure out
what romantic love was
											by looking at the last 45 years
of the psychological research
											and as it turns out,
											there&#39;s a very specific group of things
that happen when you fall in love.
											The first thing that happens is,
											a person begins to take on
what I call, &quot;special meaning.&quot;
											As a truck driver once said to me,
											&quot;The world had a new center,
and that center was Mary Anne.&quot;

											George Bernard Shaw said it differently.
											&quot;Love consists of overestimating
the differences
											between one woman and another.&quot;
											And indeed, that&#39;s what we do.

											And then you just focus on this person.
											You can list what you
don&#39;t like about them,
											but then you sweep that aside
and focus on what you do.

											In trying to understand romantic love,
											I decided I would read poetry
from all over the world,
											and I just want to give
you one very short poem
											from eighth-century China,
											because it&#39;s an almost perfect example
											of a man who is focused totally
on a particular woman.
											It&#39;s a little bit like when you are
madly in love with somebody
											and you walk into a parking lot —
											their car is different
from every other car in the parking lot.
											Their wine glass at dinner
											is different from every other wine glass
at the dinner party.
											And in this case, a man got hooked
on a bamboo sleeping mat.

											And I&#39;ve also come to think
											that it&#39;s one of three
basically different brain systems
											that evolved from mating and reproduction.
											One is the sex drive:
the craving for sexual gratification.
											W.H. Auden called it
an &quot;intolerable neural itch,&quot;
											and indeed, that&#39;s what it is.
											It keeps bothering you
a little bit, like being hungry.
											The second of these three brain
systems is romantic love:
											that elation, obsession of early love.
											And the third brain system is attachment:
											that sense of calm and security
you can feel for a long-term partner.

											And I think that the sex drive
evolved to get you out there,
											looking for a whole range of partners.
											You can feel it when you&#39;re just
driving along in your car.
											It can be focused on nobody.
											I think romantic love evolved
to enable you to focus your mating energy
											on just one individual at a time,
											thereby conserving mating time and energy.
											And I think that attachment,
the third brain system,
											evolved to enable you to tolerate
this human being
											at least long enough to raise
a child together as a team.
											So with that preamble,
											I want to go into discussing
the two most profound social trends.
											One of the last 10,000 years
											and the other,
certainly of the last 25 years,
											that are going to have an impact
on these three different brain systems:
											lust, romantic love
and deep attachment to a partner.

											I&#39;ve got nothing against people
who take them short term,
											when they&#39;re going
through something horrible.
											They want to commit suicide
or kill somebody else.
											I would recommend it.
											But more and more people
in the United States
											are taking them long term.
											And indeed, what these drugs do
is raise levels of serotonin.
											And by raising levels of serotonin,
you suppress the dopamine circuit.
											Everybody knows that.
											Dopamine is associated with romantic love.
											Not only do they suppress
the dopamine circuit,
											but they kill the sex drive.
											And when you kill the sex drive,
you kill orgasm.
											And when you kill orgasm,
											you kill that flood of drugs
associated with attachment.
											The things are connected in the brain.
											And when you tamper with one brain system,
											you&#39;re going to tamper with another.
											I&#39;m just simply saying that a world
without love is a deadly place.

											I want to end with a story.
											And then, just a comment.
											I&#39;ve been studying romantic love
and sex and attachment for 30 years.
											I&#39;m an identical twin;
I am interested in why we&#39;re all alike.
											Why you and I are alike,
why the Iraqis and the Japanese
											and the Australian Aborigines
and the people of the Amazon River
											are all alike.
											And about a year ago,
											an Internet dating service,
Match.com, came to me
											and asked me if I would design
a new dating site for them.
											I said, &quot;I don&#39;t know anything
about personality. You know?
											I don&#39;t know. Do you think
you&#39;ve got the right person?&quot;
											They said, &quot;Yes.&quot;
											It got me thinking
about why it is that you fall in love
											with one person rather than another.

									<p>
											That&#39;s my current project;
it will be my next book.
											There&#39;s all kinds of reasons
											that you fall in love
with one person rather than another.
											Timing is important.
Proximity is important.
											Mystery is important.
											You fall in love with somebody
who&#39;s somewhat mysterious,
											in part because mystery
elevates dopamine in the brain,
											probably pushes you
over that threshold to fall in love.
											You fall in love with somebody
											who fits within
what I call your &quot;love map,&quot;
											an unconscious list of traits
											that you build in childhood
as you grow up.
											And I also think
that you gravitate to certain people,
											actually, with somewhat
complementary brain systems.
											And that&#39;s what I&#39;m now
contributing to this.

											But I want to tell you
a story, to illustrate.
											I&#39;ve been carrying on here
about the biology of love.
											I wanted to show you a little bit
about the culture of it, too,
											the magic of it.
											It&#39;s a story that was told to me
											by somebody who had
heard it just from one —
											probably a true story.
											It was a graduate student —
I&#39;m at Rutgers and my two colleagues —
											Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.
											That&#39;s where we put our people
in the MRI machine.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And this graduate student was madly
in love with another graduate student,
											and she was not in love with him.
											And they were
all at a conference in Beijing.
											And he knew from our work
											that if you go and do something
very novel with somebody,
											you can drive up
the dopamine in the brain,
											and perhaps trigger
this brain system for romantic love.

											And sure enough — I&#39;ve never been in one,
											but apparently they go
all around the buses and the trucks
											and it&#39;s crazy and it&#39;s noisy
and it&#39;s exciting.
											He figured that this
would drive up the dopamine,
											and she&#39;d fall in love with him.
											So off they go and she&#39;s squealing
and squeezing him
											and laughing and having a wonderful time.
											An hour later they get down
off of the rickshaw,
