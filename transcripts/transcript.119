											So I really consider myself a storyteller.
											But I don&#39;t really tell stories in the usual way,
											in the sense that I don&#39;t usually tell my own stories.
											Instead, I&#39;m really interested in building tools that allow
											large numbers of other people to tell their stories,
											people all around the world.
											I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.
											I think people are very similar,
											but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.

											You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,
											and I think we all see a lot of gaps.
											And we define ourselves by our gaps.
											There&#39;s language gaps,
											there&#39;s ethnicity and racial gaps, there&#39;s age gaps,
											there&#39;s gender gaps, there&#39;s sexuality gaps,
											there&#39;s wealth and money gaps, there&#39;s education gaps,
											there&#39;s also religious gaps.
											You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps
											because they make us feel like we identify with something,
											some smaller community.
											But I think that actually, despite our gaps,
											we really have a lot in common.
											And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need
											to express ourselves.
											I think this is a very old human desire. It&#39;s nothing new.

											But the thing about self-expression
											is that there&#39;s traditionally been this imbalance
											between the desire that we have to express ourselves
											and the number of sympathetic friends
											who are willing to stand around and listen.

									<p>
											This, also, is nothing new.
											Since the dawn of human history, we&#39;ve tried to rectify this imbalance
											by making art, writing poems, singing songs,
											scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,
											gossiping with friends. This is nothing new.

											What&#39;s new is that in the last several years
											a lot of these very traditional physical human activities,
											these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.
											And as that&#39;s happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,
											footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.
											And so what I do is, I write computer programs
											that study very large sets of these footprints,
											and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them —
											what they feel, what they think,
											what&#39;s different in the world today than usual,
											these sorts of questions.

											One project that explores these ideas,
											which was made about a year ago,
											is a piece called We Feel Fine.
											This is a piece that every two or three minutes
											scans the world&#39;s newly-posted blog entries
											for occurrences of the phrases &quot;I feel&quot; or &quot;I am feeling.&quot;
											And when it finds one of those phrases,
											it grabs the sentence up to the period,
											and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender
											and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.
											Then, knowing the geographical location and the time,
											we can also then figure out the weather
											when that person wrote the sentence.
											All of this information is saved in a database
											that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.
											It&#39;s been running for about a year and a half.
											It&#39;s reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.
											And I&#39;ll show you a glimpse
											of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.

											What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles,
											each of which represents a single human feeling
											that was stated in the last few hours.
											The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside —
											so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.
											And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.
											The diameter of each dot
											represents the length of the sentence inside,
											so that the large dots contain large sentences,
											and the small dots contain small sentences.
											Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,
											&quot;I would just feel so much better
											if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me
											in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips.&quot;
											So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes
											in the world of human emotions.
											And all of these are stated by people:
											&quot;I know that objectively it really doesn&#39;t mean much,
											but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,
											it&#39;s nice to feel bigger again.&quot;

											The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics,
											and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.
											And then they also exhibit curiosity.
											You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.
											You can see some other ones
											are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen
											around six words. Those six words represent the six movements
											of We Feel Fine. We&#39;re currently seeing Madness.
											There&#39;s also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.
											And I&#39;ll walk you through a few of those now.
											Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.
											And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,
											they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.
											&quot;I feel a bit better now.&quot;

											The next movement is called Montage.
											Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs

											This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world&#39;s feelings

											Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.
											We see, &quot;I just feel like I&#39;m not going to have fun

											The next movement is called mobs.
											Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns
											of the population of the world&#39;s feelings in the last few hours.
											We see that &quot;better&quot; is the most frequent feeling right now,
											followed by &quot;good,&quot; &quot;bad,&quot; &quot;guilty,&quot; &quot;right,&quot; &quot;down,&quot; &quot;sick&quot; and so on.
											We can also get a gender breakdown.
											And we see that women are slightly more prolific
											talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.
											We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram
											of the world&#39;s emotional distribution by age.
											We see people in their twenties are the most prolific,
											followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,
											and it dies out very quickly from there.
											In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics
											of the weather that they represent,
											so that the ones collected on a sunny day
											swirl around as if they&#39;re part of the sun.
											The cloudy ones float along as if they&#39;re on a breeze.
											The rainy ones fall down as if they&#39;re in a rainstorm,

											The final movement is called Mounds.
											It&#39;s a bit different from the others.
											Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs
											which kind of jiggle.
											And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.
											We see &quot;better&quot; is the most frequent feeling, followed by &quot;bad.&quot;
											And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,
											and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.
											You can see the little pink cursor moving along,

											&quot;I feel very lonely.&quot;
											&quot;I need to be in some backwoods redneck town
											so that I can feel beautiful.&quot;
											&quot;I feel invisible to you.&quot;
											&quot;I wouldn&#39;t hide it if society didn&#39;t make me feel like I needed to.&quot;

											So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique
											that I call &quot;passive observation.&quot;
											What I mean by that is that it passively observes people
											as they live their lives. It scans the world&#39;s blogs
											and looks at what people are writing,
											and these people don&#39;t know they&#39;re being watched or interviewed.
											And because of that,
											you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses
											that are often very moving.
											And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work
											because people don&#39;t know they&#39;re being interviewed.
											They&#39;re just living life, and they end up just acting like that.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Another technique is directly questioning people.
											And this is a technique that I explored in a different project,
											the Yahoo! Time Capsule,
											which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.
											It was divided into ten very simple themes —
											love, anger, sadness and so on —
											each of which contained a single, very open-ended question
											put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?
											What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.
											The time capsule was available for one month online,
											translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.
											It&#39;s a spinning globe,
											the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures
											and words and drawings of people
											that submitted to the time capsule.
											The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.
											You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.
											This is in response to, What&#39;s beautiful? &quot;Miss World.&quot;

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											There are two modes to the time capsule.
											There&#39;s One World, which presents the spinning globe,
											and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips
											and lets you sift through them one by one.
											So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,
											which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico
											at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,
											the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides
											of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,
											which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.
											And we also projected the contents of the time capsule
											as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.
											You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor
											at about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing
											because the first night I looked at all this information
											and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier —
											the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,
											and saw these images go across the rocks,
											I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events
											depicted again and again and again.
											You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,
											the first camel or horse — depending on the culture.
											And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken
											the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,
											where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.
											And there was something very moving
											about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.

											And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,
											and how humans have always used the night sky
											to project their great stories.
											You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,
											I would often look up into the dark sky
											and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.
											And as an adult, I&#39;ve been more aware
											of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.
											You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.
											Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.
											Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.
											I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.

											And it caused me to wonder about our world today.
											And it caused me to wonder specifically,
											if we could make new constellations today,
											what would those look like? What would those be?
											If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?
											What are the great stories of today?

											So, Universe will open here.
											And you&#39;ll see that it leads with a shifting star field,
											and there&#39;s an Aurora Borealis in the background,
											kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis
											can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,
											and we&#39;ll put it down here to red.

											Now, these aren&#39;t just little points of light, little pixels.
											Each of those stars actually represents
											a specific event in the real world —
											a quote that was stated by somebody, an image,
											a news story, a person, a company. You know,
											some kind of heroic personality.
											And you might notice that as the cursor begins
											to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.
											We see here there&#39;s a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.
											And we see here a photograph with a head.
											You can start to see words emerging here.

											playing a big role recently.
											President Ford — this is Gerald Ford&#39;s funeral.
											We can actually click anything in Universe

											We can pull out his secrets,

											Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.
											We can see the stories
											that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.
											Any of those can be opened up.
											So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.
											You can see that this is an important story;
											there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up,
											we get different perspectives on this story.

											these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.
											We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach
											of Bill Clinton in the last week or so.
											We can see he&#39;s been focused in America
											because he&#39;s been campaigning, probably,
											but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.
											And then we can also see a timeline.
											So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,
