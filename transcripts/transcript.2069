<title>Tania Simoncelli: Should you be able to patent a human gene? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A decade ago, US law said human genes were patentable -- which meant patent holders had the right to stop anyone from sequencing, testing or even looking at a patented gene. Troubled by the way this law both harmed patients and created a barrier to biomedical innovation, Tania Simoncelli and her colleagues at the ACLU challenged it. In this riveting talk, hear the story of how they took a case everybody told them they would lose all the way to the Supreme Court." />

<meta content='Should you be able to patent a human gene?' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='A decade ago, US law said human genes were patentable — which meant patent holders had the right to stop anyone from sequencing, testing or even looking at a patented gene. Troubled by the way this law both harmed patients and created a barrier to biomedical innovation, Tania Simoncelli and her colleagues at the ACLU challenged it. In this riveting talk, hear the story of how they took a case everybody told them they would lose all the way to the Supreme Court.' itemprop='description'>

									<p>
											It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.
											I was working at the ACLU
as the organization&#39;s science advisor.
											I really, really loved my job,
											but I was having one of those days
											where I was feeling
just a little bit discouraged.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I wandered down the hallway
to my colleague Chris Hansen&#39;s office.
											Chris had been at the ACLU
for more than 30 years,
											so he had deep institutional
knowledge and insights.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I explained to Chris
that I was feeling a little bit stuck.
											I had been investigating
a number of issues
											at the intersection of science
and civil liberties — super interesting.
											But I wanted the ACLU to engage
these issues in a much bigger way,
											in a way that could really
make a difference.

to the chase, and he says,

looking at, what are the top five?&quot;

											&quot;Well, there&#39;s genetic discrimination,

for lie detection, and ...
											oh, and of course, there&#39;s gene patents.&quot;

											I went back to my office
and sent Chris three articles.
											And 20 minutes later,
he came bursting in my office.
											&quot;Oh my god! You&#39;re right! Who can we sue?&quot;

									<p>
											Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,
											but he knew almost nothing
about patent law
											and certainly nothing about genetics.
											I knew something about genetics,
but I wasn&#39;t even a lawyer,
											let alone a patent lawyer.
											So clearly we had a lot to learn
before we could file a lawsuit.

											Well, the patent office
had been issuing these patents

											There were literally thousands
of patents on human genes.
											The patent bar was deeply
entrenched in the status quo,
											the biotech industry had grown up
around this practice,

had been introduced

											Women with certain mutations

											Within 24 hours of the decision,
											five labs had announced
											that they would begin to offer testing
for the BRCA genes.
											Some of them promised to offer the tests
at a lower price than Myriad&#39;s.
											Some promised to provide
a more comprehensive test

											But of course the decision
goes far beyond Myriad.
											It ends a 25-year practice
of allowing patents on human genes
											in the United States.
											It clears a significant barrier
to biomedical discovery and innovation.
											And it helps to ensure that patients
like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen
											have access to the tests that they need.

											A few weeks after the court
issued its decision,

											It was from Bob Cook-Deegan,

Chris and I went to visit

whether to bring this case.

											We took a big risk in taking this case.
											Part of what gave us the courage
to take that risk
											was knowing that we were doing
the right thing.
											The process took nearly eight years
from the start to finish,
											with many twists and turns along the way.
											A little luck certainly helped,

that we bridged,
											the alliances that we created,
											that made pigs fly.
