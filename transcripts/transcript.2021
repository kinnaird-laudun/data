											Every day, I listen to harrowing stories

											A Syrian refugee, 19 years old,
											she was living a grinding existence
in Egypt working day wages.
											Her dad was constantly thinking
of his thriving business back in Syria
											that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.
											And the war that drove them there
was still raging in its fourth year.
											And the community
that once welcomed them there
											had become weary of them.
											And one day, men on motorcycles
tried to kidnap her.
											Once an aspiring student
thinking only of her future,
											now she was scared all the time.

with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.
											Bassem was also struggling in Egypt,
and he said to Doaa,
											&quot;Let&#39;s go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.
											I will work, you can study —
the promise of a new life.&quot;
											And he asked her father
for her hand in marriage.

											It was August that year,
and already 2,000 people had died
											trying to cross the Mediterranean,
											but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it
all the way to Northern Europe,
											and she thought, &quot;Maybe we can, too.&quot;
											So she asked her parents if they could go,
											and after a painful discussion,
they consented,
											and Bassem paid his entire life savings —
2,500 dollars each —
											to the smugglers.

											It was a Saturday morning
when the call came,
											and they were taken by bus to a beach,
hundreds of people on the beach.
											They were taken then by small boats
onto an old fishing boat,
											500 of them crammed onto that boat,
											300 below, [200] above.
											There were Syrians, Palestinians,
Africans, Muslims and Christians,
											100 children, including Sandra —
little Sandra, six years old —
											and Masa, 18 months.
											There were families on that boat,
crammed together shoulder to shoulder,

											Doaa was sitting with her legs
crammed up to her chest,

											Day four, the passengers
were getting agitated.
											They asked the captain,
&quot;When will we get there?&quot;
											He told them to shut up,
and he insulted them.
											He said, &quot;In 16 hours we will reach
the shores of Italy.&quot;
											They were weak and weary.
											Soon they saw a boat approach —
a smaller boat, 10 men on board,
											who started shouting at them,
hurling insults,
											throwing sticks, asking them
to all disembark
											and get on this smaller,
more unseaworthy boat.
											The parents were terrified
for their children,
											and they collectively
refused to disembark.
											So the boat sped away in anger,
											and a half an hour later, came back
											and started deliberately ramming a hole
in the side of Doaa&#39;s boat,
											just below where she
and Bassem were sitting.
											And she heard how they yelled,
											&quot;Let the fish eat your flesh!&quot;
											And they started laughing
as the boat capsized and sank.

											The 300 people below deck were doomed.
											Doaa was holding on to the side
of the boat as it sank,
											and watched in horror as a small child
was cut to pieces by the propeller.
											Bassem said to her, &quot;Please let go,
											or you&#39;ll be swept in and the propeller
will kill you, too.&quot;
											And remember — she can&#39;t swim.
											But she let go and she started moving
her arms and her legs,
											thinking, &quot;This is swimming.&quot;
											And miraculously,
Bassem found a life ring.
											It was one of those child&#39;s rings
											that they use to play
in swimming pools and on calm seas.
											And Doaa climbed onto the ring,
											her arms and her legs
dangling by the side.
											Bassem was a good swimmer,
											so he held her hand and tread water.
											Around them there were corpses.
											Around 100 people survived initially,
											and they started coming together
in groups, praying for rescue.
											But when a day went by and no one came,
											some people gave up hope,
											and Doaa and Bassem watched
											as men in the distance took their
life vests off and sank into the water.

											One man approached them
with a small baby perched on his shoulder,

											He was holding onto a gas canister
to stay afloat, and he said to them,
											&quot;I fear I am not going to survive.
											I&#39;m too weak. I don&#39;t have
the courage anymore.&quot;
											And he handed little Malek
over to Bassem and to Doaa,

									<p>
											And let me take a pause
in this story right here
											and ask the question:
											why do refugees like Doaa
take these kinds of risks?
											Millions of refugees are living
in exile, in limbo.
											They&#39;re living in countries [fleeing]
from a war that has been raging
											for four years.
											Even if they wanted to return, they can&#39;t.
											Their homes, their businesses,
											their towns and their cities
have been completely destroyed.
											This is a UNESCO World Heritage City,
											Homs, in Syria.
											So people continue to flee
into neighboring countries,
											and we build refugee camps
for them in the desert.
											Hundreds of thousands of people
live in camps like these,
											and thousands and thousands more,
millions, live in towns and cities.
											And the communities,
											the neighboring countries
that once welcomed them
											with open arms and hearts
											are overwhelmed.
											There are simply not enough schools,
water systems, sanitation.
											Even rich European countries
could never handle such an influx
											without massive investment.
											The Syria war has driven almost
four million people over the borders,
											but over seven million people
are on the run inside the country.
											That means that over half
the Syrian population
											has been forced to flee.
											Back to those neighboring
countries hosting so many.
											They feel that the richer world
has done too little to support them.
											And days have turned into months,
months into years.
											A refugee&#39;s stay is supposed
to be temporary.

											Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.
											It was their second day,
and Bassem was getting very weak.
											And now it was Doaa&#39;s turn
to say to Bassem,
											&quot;My love, please hold on to hope,
to our future. We will make it.&quot;
											And he said to her,
											&quot;I&#39;m sorry, my love,
that I put you in this situation.
											I have never loved anyone
as much as I love you.&quot;
											And he released himself into the water,
											and Doaa watched as the love of her life
drowned before her eyes.

											Later that day,
											a mother came up to Doaa with her
small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.
											This was the little girl I showed you
in the picture earlier,
											with the life vests.
											Her older sister Sandra had just drowned,
											and her mother knew she had to do
everything in her power
											to save her daughter.
											And she said to Doaa,
&quot;Please take this child.
											Let her be part of you.
I will not survive.&quot;
											And then she went away and drowned.

											So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee
who was terrified of the water,
											who couldn&#39;t swim,
											found herself in charge
of two little baby kids.
											And they were thirsty and they were hungry
and they were agitated,
											and she tried her best to amuse them,
											to sing to them, to say words
to them from the Quran.
											Around them, the bodies were bloating
and turning black.
											The sun was blazing during the day.
											At night, there was a cold moon and fog.
											It was very frightening.
											On the fourth day in the water,
this is how Doaa probably looked
											on the ring with her two children.

											&quot;She just went away
to find you water and food.&quot;

the little boy into the water.

like she shouted for about two hours.
