											If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey,
											and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith,
											you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke&#39;s representation
											that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.
											In this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool,
											using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,
											running around and eating and doing each other
											figured out they can make things if they used a tool.
											And that moved us to the next level.

											And, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular
											have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology,
											and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.
											And we&#39;ve seen many seminal moments.
											We&#39;ve seen the creation of small computers in the &#39;70s and early &#39;80s,
											and who would have thought back then that every single person
											would not have just one computer but probably 20,
											in your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device —
											in your washing machine, your cell phone.
											You&#39;re walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.
											Then we go along and create the Internet

											I thought I&#39;d take a moment to tell you what a genome is.
											It&#39;s, sort of, like if you ask people,
											Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?
											People never want to say, I really don&#39;t understand.
											So, I will tell you right off of the bat.
											You&#39;ve heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.
											A genome is really a description for 
all of the DNA that is in a living organism.
											And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.
											It doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re a yeast;
											it doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re a mouse;
											doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re a fly; we all have DNA.
											The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.

											And when Watson and Crick in the &#39;50s
											first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule —
											very long, complicated molecule —
											we then started on this journey to understand that
											inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,
											what we inherit, what diseases we may get.
											We&#39;ve also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,
											that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,
											since the beginning of us, of us as creatures.
											There is a historical archive.

											Living in your genome is the history of our species,
											and you as an individual human being, where you&#39;re from,
											going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years,
											and that&#39;s now starting to be understood.
											But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.
											It is the program. It is the code of life.
											It is what makes you function;
											it is what makes every organism function.
											DNA is a very elegant molecule.
											It&#39;s long and it&#39;s complicated.
											Really all you have to know about it is that there&#39;s four letters:
											A, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.
											And with these four letters, you can create a language:
											a language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.
											You know, they are generally put together in pairs,
											creating a word or what we call base pairs.
											And you would, you know, when you think about it,
											four letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work.

											And that may not sound very intuitive,
											but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that&#39;s computers.
											Look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures
											and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.
											The language of technology is binary;
											you&#39;ve probably heard that at some point in time.
											Everything that happens in digital is converted,
											or a representation, of a one and a zero.
											So, when you&#39;re listening to iTunes and your favorite music,
											that&#39;s really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.
											When you&#39;re seeing these pictures, it&#39;s all ones and zeros,
											and when you&#39;re talking on your telephone, your cell phone,
											and it&#39;s going over the network,
											your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around.
											And look at all the complex things and wonderful things
											we&#39;ve been able to create with just a one and a zero.

											Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity,
											a lot of ways to describe mechanisms.
											So, let&#39;s talk about what that means.
											So, if you look at a human genome,
											they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That&#39;s a lot.
											And they mix up in all different fashions,
											and that makes you a human being.
											If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,
											we&#39;re actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.
											It&#39;s not really all that much data.

											This here is a bug in my genome
											that I have struggled with for a long, long time.
											When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.
											In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time,
											like cancer, we haven&#39;t been able to cure
											because we just don&#39;t understand how it works at the genomic level.
											We are starting to understand that.

											So, up to this point we tried to fix it
											by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology,
											which means, well, let&#39;s just throw chemicals at it,
											and maybe it&#39;s going to make it work.
											But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?
											What is the code?
											What are the exact instructions that are making it do that?
											then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.
											So, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here&#39;s a few factoids for you.

											We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.
											We have about a hundred, 120,000 others
											that don&#39;t appear to function every day,

											They recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes,
											so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity
											or the evolutionary order of any particular species.
											Now, look around: just look next to your neighbor,
											look forward, look backward. We all look pretty different.
											A lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby,
											different races, cultures. We are all 99.9% genetically equal.
											It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material
											that makes the difference between any one of us.

											So, we are now able to read genomes.
											The first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.
											It was done by Dr. Craig Venter.
											And then James Watson&#39;s — one of the co-founders of DNA —
											genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.
											And if you think about the computer industry
											and how we&#39;ve gone from big computers to little ones
											and how they get more powerful and faster all the time,
											the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now:
											we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes

											What does a genome look like?
											Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.
											If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this,
											but what scientists are doing now is
											they&#39;re understanding what these do and what they mean.
											Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.
											In other words, the first couple of sentences here,
											assuming this is a grape plant:
											make a root, make a branch, create a blossom.
											In a human being, down in here it could be:
											make blood cells, start cancer.
											For me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve,
											because I come from a very cold climate.
											For my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.

											We can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries,

											why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.
											We can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,

											This company, Synthetic Genomics, I&#39;m involved with,
											created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug,
											a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.
											If you have a UTI, you&#39;ve probably — or ever had a UTI —
											you&#39;ve come in contact with this little bug.
											Very simple — only has about 246 genes —
											but we were able to completely synthesize that genome.
											Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself,
											So, if I plug this synthetic genome — if I pull the old one out and plug it in —
											does it just boot up and live?
											Well, guess what. It does.

											you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.
											It&#39;s, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.
											Well, actually, you could do it the other way.

											They have discovered pathways that create flavors,

											we&#39;re just learning what the rules are.
											I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease —
											if you could make disease go away,
											because we understand how it actually works,
											if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants
											that grow in very hard-to-grow environments,
											if we could create clean and plentiful energy —
											we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics,
											have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide
											and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.
											So, carbon dioxide — the stuff we want to get rid of — not sugar, not anything.
											Carbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight,
											you end up with a lipid that is highly refined.
											We could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,;
											we could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine.
