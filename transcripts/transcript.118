											I&#39;m going to talk to you today about
											hopefully converting fear into hope.
											When we go to the physician today —
											when we go to the doctor&#39;s office and we walk in,
											there are words that we just don&#39;t want to hear.
											There are words that we&#39;re truly afraid of.
											Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson&#39;s, Alzheimer&#39;s,
											heart failure, lung failure —
											things that we know are debilitating diseases,
											for which there&#39;s relatively little that can be done.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And what I want to lay out for you today is
											a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,
											why it&#39;s important,
											why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down
											if you think it already hasn&#39;t,
											and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,
											and what some of the hurdles are.
											And we&#39;re going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.

											I want to start with this slide,
											because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
											This was an issue from 2002
											that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
											It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
											Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept
											that everybody can understand.
											It&#39;s simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself
											to a clinically relevant timescale.
											So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
											We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
											And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
											This is not regenerative medicine.
											Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up
											when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
											The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms
											with devices and drugs and the like —
											and I&#39;ll come back to that theme a few times —
											instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body
											by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
											So that at the end of the treatment,
											you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.

											Very few good ideas — if you agree that this is a good idea —
											very few good ideas are truly novel.
											And this is just the same.
											If you look back in history,
											Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,
											was actually one of the first people
											along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,
											to begin to think about, could you culture organs?
											And they published this book in 1937,
											where they actually began to think about,
											what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
											We&#39;ve come a long way since then.
											I&#39;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that&#39;s going on.

											But before doing that, what I&#39;d like to do
											is share my depression about the health care system
											and the need for this with you.
											Many of the talks yesterday talked about
											improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,
											and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
											One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
											And the longer we live, the more expensive it is
											to take care of our diseases as we get older.

											This is simply the wealth of a country
											versus the percent of population over the age of 65.
											And you can basically see that the richer a country is,
											the older the people are within it.
											Why is this important?
											And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
											If the average age of your population is 30,
											then the average kind of disease that you have to treat
											is maybe a broken ankle every now and again,
											maybe a little bit of asthma.
											If the average age in your country is 45 to 55,
											now the average person is looking at diabetes,
											early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease —
											things that are inherently more difficult to treat,
											and much more expensive to treat.

											Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.
											This is from &quot;The Untied States of America.&quot;
											In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.
											41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,
											paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
											In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
											And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
											How can you actually afford to treat patients

											This is age versus cost of health care.
											And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,
											there&#39;s a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
											It&#39;s actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,
											you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,
											plotted over your lifetime.
											And about seven years before you&#39;re about to die, there&#39;s a spike.

											There are very few things, very few things that you can really do

											I&#39;d suggest there are four things,

											But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,
											is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,
											and then treating the disease to cure the disease
											instead of treating a symptom.
											Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
											Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
											We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,
											and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
											And we do OK. Insulin&#39;s a pretty good therapy.
											But eventually it stops working,
											and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.

											This video, I think, gets across the concept that I&#39;m talking about quite dramatically.
											This is a newt re-growing its limb.
											If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can&#39;t we?
											I&#39;ll actually show you some more important features
											about limb regeneration in a moment.
											But what we&#39;re talking about in regenerative medicine
											is doing this in every organ system of the body,
											for tissues and for organs themselves.
											So today&#39;s reality is that if we get sick,
											the message is we will treat your symptoms,

											we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.
											There&#39;s a limb prosthetic up here,
											similar actually one on the soldier
											that&#39;s come back from Iraq.
											There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
											Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually

											But it&#39;s applicable, again, to every organ system.
											How can we do that?
											The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
											We need to learn to speak the body&#39;s language.
											And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
											A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,
											will re-grow that limb.
											So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
											It&#39;s a natural process,
											but it is lost as we age.
											In a child, before the age of about six months,
											if they lose their fingertip in an accident,
											they&#39;ll re-grow their fingertip.
											By the time they&#39;re five, they won&#39;t be able to do that anymore.

											The first is cellular therapies.
											Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,
											using cells to do most of the work.
											Therefore, if we can find the right cells
											and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
											Secondly, we can use materials.
											We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
											If we can invent materials, design materials,
											or extract materials from a natural environment,
											then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
											And finally, we may be able to use smart devices
											that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.

											I&#39;m going to show you an example of each of these,
											and I&#39;m going to start with materials.
											Steve Badylak — who&#39;s at the University of Pittsburgh —
											about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
											And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,
											if you threw away all the cells,
											and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,
											may contain all of the necessary factors and signals
											that would signal the body to heal itself.
											And he asked a very important question.
											He asked the question,
											if I take that material, which is a natural material
											that usually induces healing in the small intestine,
											and I place it somewhere else on a person&#39;s body,
											would it give a tissue-specific response,
											or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?

											I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,

											which is amputation, if you can&#39;t heal it.
											So I&#39;m going to put the slide up now. It won&#39;t be up for long.
											This is a diabetic ulcer. It&#39;s tragic.

											it&#39;s going to be right around this point

											If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,
											for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.

											basically we do a sodding approach.
											We make something over here,

											In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed —

											So they&#39;re putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.

											And I&#39;m going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,
											at the director of the NIH, who&#39;s a very charming man.
											Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard
											went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute
											just a few months ago,

											of that 27.5 billion dollars that he&#39;s going to get next year
											and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace
											at which these things get to patients.
											And at the end of a very testy meeting,
											what the NIH director said was,
											&quot;Your vision is larger than our appetite.&quot;
											I&#39;d like to close by saying that no one&#39;s going to change our vision,
