<title>John Cary: How architecture can create dignity for all | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: If architect and writer John Cary has his way, women will never need to stand in pointlessly long bathroom lines again. Lines like these are representative of a more serious issue, Cary says: the lack of diversity in design that leads to thoughtless, compassionless spaces. Design has a unique ability to dignify and make people feel valued, respected, honored and seen -- but the flip side is also true. Cary calls for architects and designers to expand their ranks and commit to serving the public good, not just the privileged few. &quot;Well-designed spaces are not just a matter of taste or a questions of aesthetics,&quot; he says. &quot;They literally shape our ideas about who we are in the world and what we deserve.&quot; And we all deserve better." />

<meta content='How architecture can create dignity for all' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='If architect and writer John Cary has his way, women will never need to stand in pointlessly long bathroom lines again. Lines like these are representative of a more serious issue, Cary says: the lack of diversity in design that leads to thoughtless, compassionless spaces. Design has a unique ability to dignify and make people feel valued, respected, honored and seen — but the flip side is also true. Cary calls for architects and designers to expand their ranks and commit to serving the public good, not just the privileged few. "Well-designed spaces are not just a matter of taste or a questions of aesthetics," he says. "They literally shape our ideas about who we are in the world and what we deserve." And we all deserve better.' itemprop='description'>

											On a beautiful day, just a few years ago
											my wife and I entered a hospital
											near our home in Oakland, California
											for the birth of our first daughter, Maya.
											We had responsibly toured
the birthing center in advance
											and yet we were somehow
still startled to find ourselves
											in the place where we would experience
											one of the most significant
moments of our lives.
											We were stuck in a windowless room
											with no hint of the bright
and sunny day that we had left.
											Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead,
											the paint on the walls was beige
											and machines beeped inexplicably
											as a wall clock indicated
day turning to night.
											That clock was placed above a door
											in direct line of sight
											to where my wife lay as her contractions
increased hour after hour.
											Now, I&#39;ve never given birth —

											An architect by training,
I&#39;ve always been fascinated
											watching people experience design
in the world around them.
											I believe design functions
like the soundtrack
											that we&#39;re not even
fully aware is playing.
											It sends us subconscious messages
about how to feel
											and what to expect.
											That room that we were in
seemed completely misaligned
											with the moment
that we were experiencing —
											welcoming a human being,
											our daughter, into this world.

											At one point a nurse, without any prompt,

rooms like this better.&#39;&quot;

											Despite the immense joy
of our daughter&#39;s birth,
											the messages of that hospital room
stick with she and I to this day.
											Those messages are,
											&quot;You are not at home,
											you are in a foreign place.&quot;
											&quot;You are not in control of anything.
											Not even the lighting.&quot;
											&quot;Your comfort, simply, is secondary.&quot;
											At best,

											I went into architecture
because I believed
											it was about creating spaces for people
to live their best lives.
											And yet what I found
is a profession largely disconnected
											from the people most directly
impacted by its work.
											I believe this is because
architecture remains
											a white, male, elitist profession —
											seemingly unconcerned
											with some of the greatest
needs in the world
											or even the relatively simple needs
of an expectant mother.
											Students are trained in school
											using highly theoretical projects,
											rarely interacting with real people
or actual communities.
											Graduates are funneled
through a long, narrow
											unforgiving path to licensure.

											Meanwhile, the profession
holds up a select few
											through relentless award programs
											focused almost exclusively
on the aesthetics of buildings,
											rather than the societal impact
or contributions of them.
											It only goes to reinforce a warped view
											of professional responsibility and success
											and yet this isn&#39;t
why so many young, hopeful people
											go into architecture.

has a unique ability to dignify.

											Now I&#39;d like for you to just think
about some of the spaces that you inhabit.
											And I&#39;d like to have you think
about how they make you feel.
											Now, there are places
that make us feel unhappy,
											unhealthy
											or uninspiring.
											They may be the places that you work
											or where you heal
											or even where you live.
											And I ask, how might these places
be better designed with you in mind?
											It&#39;s a really simple question
											and it can somehow, sometimes
be very difficult to answer.
											Because we are conditioned
to feel like we don&#39;t have much agency
											over the spaces and places
that we live, work and play.
											And in many cases we don&#39;t.

											It may seem like a small thing,

of a much more serious issue.
											The contemporary world
was literally built by men
											who have rarely
taken the time to understand
											how people unlike them

											A long bathroom line
might seem like a minor indignity.
											But the opposite can also be true.
											Thoughtful design
can make people feel respected
											and seen.
											I&#39;ve come to believe
that dignity is to design
											what justice is to law
											and health is to medicine.
											In the simplest of terms,

											I listened to Gregory,

homeless people in Dallas.
											Gregory had been living on the streets,

is designed beautifully

for three decades.
											When he arrived with little more

											On the other side of the world,

											People like these are invaluable
ambassadors for design
											and yet they are roundly absent
from architectural discourse.
											Similarly, the people who can
most benefit from good design
											often have the least access to it.
											Your cousin, a homeless veteran;
											your grandma or grandpa
											who live in a house with a kitchen
that&#39;s no longer accessible to them;
											your wheelchair-bound sister

											If good design
is only for a privileged few,
											what good is it?
											It&#39;s time designers change this
											by dedicating their practices
to the public good
											in the model of firms
											like Orkidstudio,
											Studio Gang
											and MASS Design Group.
											Their clients
											are orphaned children in Kenya,
											foster children in Chicago
											and pregnant women in Malawi.
											Their practices are premised on the belief
											that everyone deserves good design.
											Dedicating more practices
to the public good
											will not only create
more design that is dignifying,
											but it will also
dignify the practice of design.
											It will not only diversify
the client base of design,
											but it will also create new,
more diverse forms of design
											for the world.

											Now, in order to do this,
											my architecture and design friends,
especially my fellow white guys,
											we must simultaneously
and significantly diversify our ranks.
											If we want the public to believe
that design is for them
											and for everyone.
											Today, barely 15 percent
											of registered architects
in the United States are women.
											And a far smaller percentage
are persons of color.
											Other professions, like law and medicine
											had made far greater strides
in these crucial areas.
											How might our shared built environment —
											our homes, our hospitals,
our schools, our public spaces —
											be shaped differently
											if women and people of color
											were behind half
of the proverbial blueprints?
											It is not a question of whether,
											but to what extent
											our buildings, our landscapes,
											our cities and our rural communities
											are less beautiful, less functional,
											less equitable and less dignifying
											because women and people of color
are less likely to be creating them.

											As Winston Churchill
famously noted in 1943
											when he called for the rebuilding
											of London&#39;s war-damaged
parliamentary chambers,
											&quot;We shape our buildings,
and afterward, they shape us.&quot;
											The good news is
that we can change how we build
											and who we build for.
											Be that a health worker in rural Rwanda,
											or a birthing mother and nervous
new father in the United States.
											We can do this
by recommitting architecture
											to the health, safety
and welfare of the public.
											This will pay dividends.
											Because once you see what design can do,
											you can&#39;t unsee it.
											And once you experience dignity,
											you can&#39;t accept anything less.
											Both become part of your possible.
