											The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online
											started out the way most things do:
											without me, and not online.
											On December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,
											Alfred Nobel, died.
											One hundred years later, exactly, actually,
											December 10, 1996,
											this charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska,
											won the Nobel Prize for literature.
											She&#39;s a Polish poet.
											She&#39;s a big deal, obviously,
											but back in &#39;96, I thought I had never heard of her,
											and when I checked out her work,
											I found this sweet little poem,
											&quot;Four in the Morning.&quot;

											And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,
											I fell for it hard,
											so hard, I suspected we must have met
											somewhere before.
											Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem?
											Did I flirt with this poem
											in a coffee shop somewhere?
											I could not place it, and it bugged me,
											and then in the coming week or two,
											I would just be watching an old movie,
											and this would happen.

											In 2007, I was invited to speak at TED
											for the second time,
											and since I was still an authority on nothing,
											I thought, what if I made a multimedia presentation
											on a topic so niche
											it is actually inconsequential
											or actually cockamamie.
											So my talk had some of my
four in the morning examples,
											but it also had examples
											from my fellow TED speakers that year.
											I found four in the morning in a novel
											by Isabel Allende.
											I found a really great one
											in the autobiography of Bill Clinton.
											I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening,
											although Matt Groening told me later
											that he could not make my talk
											because it was a morning session
											and I gather that he is not an early riser.
											However, had Matt been there,
											he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory
											that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.
											It was totally contrived
											just for that room, just for that moment.
											That&#39;s how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.
											It was fun. That was pretty much it.

											When I got home, though,
the emails started coming in
											from people who had seen the talk live,
											beginning with, and this is still my favorite,
											&quot;Here&#39;s another one for your collection:
											&#39;It&#39;s the friends you can call
up at 4 a.m. that matter.&#39;&quot;
											The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich.
											The email itself was from another very
											sexy European type,
											TED Curator Chris Anderson.
											(Laughter)
											Chris found this quote
											on a coffee cup or something,
											and I&#39;m thinking, this man is the Typhoid Mary
											of ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.
											I am contagious,
											which was confirmed less than a week later
											when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent
											an actual greeting card
											with that same quotation.
											As a bonus, she hooked me up
with a second one they make.
											It says, &quot;Just knowing I can call you
											at four in the morning if I need to
											makes me not really need to,&quot;
											which I love, because together these are like,
											&quot;Hallmark: When you care enough
											to send the very best twice,
											phrased slightly differently.&quot;

											Just when things were getting pretty interesting,
											things got really interesting.
											TED.com launched, later that year,
											with a bunch of videos from past talks,
											including mine,
											and I started receiving &quot;four in the morning&quot; citations
											from what seemed like every
time zone on the planet.
											Much of it was content I never would have found
											on my own if I was looking for it,
											and I was not.
											I don&#39;t know anybody with juvenile diabetes.
											I probably would have missed the booklet,
											&quot;Grilled Cheese at Four O&#39;Clock in the Morning.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											I do not subscribe to Crochet Today! magazine,
											although it looks delightful. (Laughter)
											Take note of those clock ends.
											This is a college student&#39;s suggestion
											for what a &quot;four in the morning&quot; gang sign
											should look like.
											People sent me magazine ads.
											They took photographs in grocery stores.
											I got a ton of graphic novels and comics.
											A lot of good quality work, too:
											&quot;The Sandman,&quot; &quot;Watchmen.&quot;
											There&#39;s a very cute example
here from &quot;Calvin and Hobbes.&quot;
											In fact, the oldest citation anybody sent in
											was from a cartoon from the Stone Age.
											Take a look.

											First of all, you are not getting clips like that

											Secondly, I did a little research.
											You know, I was kind of interested.
											If this is confirmation bias,
											there is so much confirmation, I am biased.
											Literature probably shows it best.
											There are a couple three in
the mornings in Shakespeare.
											There&#39;s a five in the morning.
											There are seven four in the mornings,
											and they&#39;re all very dire.
											In &quot;Measure for Measure,&quot; it&#39;s
the call time for the executioner.
											Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia
											at four in the morning right before battle
											in &quot;War and Peace.&quot;
											Charlotte Brontë&#39;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has got kind of
											a pivotal four in the morning,
											as does Emily Brontë&#39;s &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;
											&quot;Lolita&quot; has as a creepy four in the morning.
											&quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; has one in dialect.
											Someone sent in H.G. Wells&#39; &quot;The Invisible Man.&quot;
											Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison&#39;s &quot;Invisible Man.&quot;
											&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; spends the last
											four in the morning of his life
											waiting for a lover who never shows,
											and the most famous wake-up in literature, perhaps,
											&quot;The Metamorphosis.&quot;
											First paragraph, the main character wakes up
											transformed into a giant cockroach,
											but we already know, cockroach notwithstanding,
											something is up with this guy.
											Why? His alarm is set for four o&#39;clock in the morning.
											What kind of person would do that?
											This kind of person would do that.
