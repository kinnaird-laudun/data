											To understand the business of mythology
											and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,
											you have to hear a story
											of Ganesha,
											the elephant-headed god
											who is the scribe of storytellers,
											and his brother,
											the athletic warlord of the gods,
											Kartikeya.
											The two brothers one day decided to go on a race,
											three times around the world.
											Kartikeya leapt on his peacock
											and flew around the continents
											and the mountains and the oceans.
											He went around once,
											he went around twice,
											he went around thrice.
											But his brother, Ganesha,
											simply walked around his parents
											once, twice, thrice,
											and said, &quot;I won.&quot;
											&quot;How come?&quot; said Kartikeya.
											And Ganesha said,
											&quot;You went around &#39;the world.&#39;
											I went around &#39;my world.&#39;&quot;
											What matters more?

											If you understand the difference between &#39;the world&#39; and &#39;my world,&#39;

											Culture is a reaction to nature,

											that different people of the world
											have a different understanding of the world.
											Different people see things differently —

											Alexander, a young Macedonian,

											Perhaps he was a Jain monk,

											To understand this difference in viewpoints,
											we have to understand
											the subjective truth of Alexander —
											his myth, and the mythology that constructed it.
											Alexander&#39;s mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle
											told him the story of Homer&#39;s &quot;Iliad.&quot;
											They told him of a great hero called Achilles,
											who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,
											but when he withdrew from the battle,
											defeat was inevitable.
											&quot;Achilles was a man who could shape history,
											a man of destiny,
											and this is what you should be, Alexander.&quot;
											That&#39;s what he heard.

											Two different mythologies.
											Which is right?
											Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.
											One linear, one cyclical.
											One believes this is the one and only life.
											The other believes this is one of many lives.
											And so, the denominator of Alexander&#39;s life was one.
											So, the value of his life was the sum total
											of his achievements.
											The denominator of the gymnosophist&#39;s life was infinity.
											So, no matter what he did,

											So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,
											&quot;All I want to do is align belief.&quot;
											Sounds so simple.
											But belief is not measurable.
											You can&#39;t measure it. You can&#39;t manage it.
											So, how do you construct belief?

											So, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,

											And I will share one of the rituals with you.
											You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.
											Hindus don&#39;t have the concept of commandments.
											So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.
											So, you&#39;re not really sure how you stand in front of God.
											So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.
											You want to see God.
											And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,
											large unblinking eyes,
											sometimes made of silver,
											so they look at you.
											Because you don&#39;t know whether you&#39;re right or wrong, and so all you seek
											is divine empathy.
											&quot;Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											&quot;Why did I do the setting,
											why I don&#39;t care for the processes. Just understand me, please.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.
											After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,
											we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,
											the customer, his family, his team, his boss.
											You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,
											and then you remove the blindfold.
											And invariably, you see a tear,
											because the penny has dropped.
											He realizes that to succeed,
											he does not have to be a &quot;professional,&quot;
											he does not have to cut out his emotions,
											he has to include all these people
											in his world to succeed, to make them happy,
											to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.
											The customer is happy, because the customer is God.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,
											behavior will happen, business will happen.
											And it has.
											So, then we come back to Alexander
											and to the gymnosophist.
											And everybody asks me, &quot;Which is the better way, this way or that way?&quot;
											And it&#39;s a very dangerous question,
											because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.
											So, I will not answer the question.
											What I will give you is an Indian answer,
											the Indian head-shake.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Depending on the context,
											depending on the outcome,
											choose your paradigm.
											You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.
											They are cultural creations,
											not natural phenomena.
											And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,
											one request:
											Understand that you live in the subjective truth,
											and so does he.
											Understand it.
											And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.
											You will discover that within infinite myths
											lies the eternal truth.
											Who sees it all?
											Varuna has but a thousand eyes.
											Indra, a hundred.
											You and I, only two.
											Thank you. Namaste.
