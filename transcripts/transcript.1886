											Tonight, I&#39;m going to try to make the case
											that inviting a loved one, a friend
or even a stranger
											to record a meaningful interview with you
											just might turn out to be one of the most 
important moments in that person&#39;s life,
											and in yours.

											When I was 22 years old,
I was lucky enough to find my calling
											when I fell into making radio stories.
											At almost the exact same time,
											I found out that my dad,
who I was very, very close to, was gay.
											I was taken completely by surprise.
											We were a very tight-knit family,
											and I was crushed.
											At some point, in one
of our strained conversations,
											my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots.
											He told me that one night in 1969,
											a group of young black
and Latino drag queens
											fought back against the police
at a gay bar in Manhattan
											called the Stonewall Inn,
											and how this sparked
the modern gay rights movement.

											It was an amazing story,
and it piqued my interest.
											So I decided to pick up my tape 
recorder and find out more.
											With the help of a young archivist
named Michael Shirker,
											we tracked down all
of the people we could find
											who had been at
the Stonewall Inn that night.
											Recording these interviews,
											I saw how the microphone
gave me the license
											to go places I otherwise
never would have gone
											and talk to people I might not
otherwise ever have spoken to.
											I had the privilege of getting to know
											some of the most amazing,
fierce and courageous human beings
											I had ever met.
											It was the first time
the story of Stonewall
											had been told to a national audience.
											I dedicated the program to my dad,
											it changed my relationship with him,
and it changed my life.

											Over the next 15 years,
I made many more radio documentaries,
											working to shine a light on people
who are rarely heard from in the media.
											Over and over again,
											I&#39;d see how this simple act
of being interviewed
											could mean so much to people,
											particularly those who had been told
that their stories didn&#39;t matter.
											I could literally see
people&#39;s back straighten
											as they started to speak
into the microphone.

											In 1998, I made a documentary
about the last flophouse hotels
											on the Bowery in Manhattan.
											Guys stayed up in these
cheap hotels for decades.
											They lived in cubicles
the size of prison cells
											covered with chicken wire
											so you couldn&#39;t jump
from one room into the next.
											Later, I wrote a book on the men
with the photographer Harvey Wang.
											I remember walking into a flophouse
with an early version of the book
											and showing one of the guys his page.
											He stood there staring at it in silence,
											then he grabbed the book out of my hand
											and started running down
the long, narrow hallway
											holding it over his head
											shouting, &quot;I exist! I exist.&quot;

											In many ways, &quot;I exist&quot; became
the clarion call for StoryCorps,
											this crazy idea that I had
a dozen years ago.
											The thought was to take
documentary work
											and turn it on its head.
											Traditionally, broadcast documentary
											has been about recording interviews
to create a work of art or entertainment
											or education that is seen or heard
by a whole lot of people,
											but I wanted to try something
											where the interview itself
was the purpose of this work,
											and see if we could give many,
many, many people the chance
											to be listened to in this way.
											So in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago,
											we built a booth where anyone 
can come to honor someone else
											by interviewing them about their life.
											You come to this booth and you&#39;re met
by a facilitator who brings you inside.
											You sit across from, say, your grandfather
											for close to an hour
and you listen and you talk.
											Many people think of it as,
if this was to be our last conversation,
											what would I want to ask of
and say to this person
											who means so much to me?
											At the end of the session,
you walk away with a copy of the interview
											and another copy goes
to the American Folklife Center
											at the Library of Congress
											so that your great-great-great-grandkids
can someday get to know your grandfather
											through his voice and story.

											So we open this booth
in one of the busiest places in the world
											and invite people to have this
incredibly intimate conversation

											People treated the experience
with incredible respect,

at that original Grand Central Booth.

											I&#39;m going to tell you
a secret about StoryCorps.
											It takes some courage
to have these conversations.
											StoryCorps speaks to our mortality.
											Participants know this recording
will be heard long after they&#39;re gone.
											There&#39;s a hospice doctor named Ira Byock
											who has worked closely with us
on recording interviews
											with people who are dying.
											He wrote a book called
&quot;The Four Things That Matter Most&quot;
											about the four things you want to say
to the most important people in your life
											before they or you die:
											thank you, I love you,
											forgive me, I forgive you.
											They&#39;re just about the most powerful words
we can say to one another,
											and often that&#39;s what happens
in a StoryCorps booth.
											It&#39;s a chance to have a sense of closure
with someone you care about —
											no regrets, nothing left unsaid.
											And it&#39;s hard and it takes courage,
											but that&#39;s why we&#39;re alive, right?

									<p>
											So, the TED Prize.
											When I first heard from TED
and Chris a few months ago
											about the possibility of the Prize,
I was completely floored.
											They asked me to come up
with a very brief wish for humanity,
											no more than 50 words.
											So I thought about it,
I wrote my 50 words,
											and a few weeks later,
Chris called and said, &quot;Go for it.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So here is my wish:
											that you will help us
											take everything we&#39;ve learned
through StoryCorps
											and bring it to the world
											so that anyone anywhere
can easily record a meaningful interview
											with another human being
which will then be archived for history.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											How are we going to do that? With this.
											We&#39;re fast moving into a future
where everyone in the world
											will have access to one of these,
											and it has powers I never
could have imagined 11 years ago
											when I started StoryCorps.
											It has a microphone,
											it can tell you how to do things,
											and it can send audio files.
											Those are the key ingredients.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the first part of the wish
is already underway.
											Over the past couple of months,
											the team at StoryCorps
has been working furiously
											to create an app that will bring
StoryCorps out of our booths
											so that it can be experienced
by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
											Remember, StoryCorps has always
been two people and a facilitator
											helping them record their conversation,
which is preserved forever,
											but at this very moment,
											we&#39;re releasing a public beta version
of the StoryCorps app.
											The app is a digital facilitator
that walks you through
											the StoryCorps interview process,
											helps you pick questions,
											and gives you all the tips you need
											to record a meaningful
StoryCorps interview,
											and then with one tap upload it 
to our archive at the Library of Congress.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That&#39;s the easy part, the technology.
											The real challenge is up to you:
											to take this tool and figure out
how we can use it
											all across America and around the world,
											so that instead of recording
thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year,
											we could potentially record
tens of thousands
											or hundreds of thousands
											or maybe even more.

											Imagine, for example,
a national homework assignment
											where every high school student
studying U.S. history across the country
											records an interview
with an elder over Thanksgiving,
											so that in one single weekend
											an entire generation of American lives
and experiences are captured.
											(Applause)
											Or imagine mothers on opposite
sides of a conflict somewhere in the world
											sitting down not to talk
about that conflict
											but to find out who they are as people,
											and in doing so,
begin to build bonds of trust;
											or that someday it becomes
a tradition all over the world
											that people are honored
with a StoryCorps interview
											on their 75th birthday;
											or that people in your community
											go into retirement homes or hospitals
or homeless shelters or even prisons
											armed with this app to honor the people
least heard in our society
											and ask them who they are,
what they&#39;ve learned in life,
											and how they want to be remembered.

											Ten years ago, I recorded
a StoryCorps interview with my dad
											who was a psychiatrist,
and became a well-known gay activist.
											This is the picture
of us at that interview.
											I never thought about that recording
until a couple of years ago,
											when my dad, who seemed
to be in perfect health
											and was still seeing patients
40 hours a week,
											was diagnosed with cancer.
											He passed away very suddenly
a few days later.
											It was June 28, 2012,
											the anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

											I listened to that interview
for the first time at three in the morning
											on the day that he died.
											I have a couple of young kids at home,
											and I knew that the only way
they were going to get to know this person
											who was such a towering figure in my life
would be through that session.
											I thought I couldn&#39;t believe in StoryCorps
any more deeply than I did,
											but it was at that moment
											that I fully and viscerally grasped
the importance of making these recordings.

											Every day, people come up to me
											and say, &quot;I wish I had interviewed
my father or my grandmother or my brother,
											but I waited too long.&quot;
											Now, no one has to wait anymore.
											At this moment,
											when so much of how we communicate
is fleeting and inconsequential,
											join us in creating this digital archive
											of conversations that are
enduring and important.
											Help us create this gift to our children,
											this testament to who
we are as human beings.
											I hope you&#39;ll help us make
this wish come true.
											Interview a family member, a friend
or even a stranger.
											Together, we can create an archive
of the wisdom of humanity,
											and maybe in doing so,
											we&#39;ll learn to listen a little more
and shout a little less.
											Maybe these conversations will remind us
what&#39;s really important.
											And maybe, just maybe,
											it will help us recognize
that simple truth
											that every life, every single life,
											matters equally and infinitely.
											Thank you very much.
											(Applause)
											Thank you. Thank you.
											(Applause)
											Thank you.
