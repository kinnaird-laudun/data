<title>Dambisa Moyo: Economic growth has stalled. Let&#39;s fix it | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Economic growth is the defining challenge of our time; without it, political and social instability rises, human progress stagnates and societies grow dimmer. But, says economist Dambisa Moyo, dogmatic capitalism isn&#39;t creating the growth we need. As she shows, in both state-sponsored and market-driven models, capitalism is failing to solve social ills, fostering corruption and creating income inequality. Moyo surveys the current economic landscape and suggests that we have to start thinking about capitalism as a spectrum so we can blend the best of different models together to foster growth." />

<meta content="Economic growth has stalled. Let's fix it" itemprop='name'>
<meta content="Economic growth is the defining challenge of our time; without it, political and social instability rises, human progress stagnates and societies grow dimmer. But, says economist Dambisa Moyo, dogmatic capitalism isn't creating the growth we need. As she shows, in both state-sponsored and market-driven models, capitalism is failing to solve social ills, fostering corruption and creating income inequality. Moyo surveys the current economic landscape and suggests that we have to start thinking about capitalism as a spectrum so we can blend the best of different models together to foster growth." itemprop='description'>

that I&#39;ve just elucidated.

											The fundamental question is this:
											How are we going to create economic growth
											in advanced and developed economies
like the United States and across Europe
											at a time when they continue to struggle
											to create economic growth
after the financial crisis?

key drivers of economic growth:

											In a similar vein,
											how are we going to create
economic growth in the emerging markets,
											where 90 percent
of the world&#39;s population lives
											and where, on average,
											70 percent of the population
is under the age of 25?
											In these countries,
											it is essential that they grow
at a minimum of seven percent a year
											in order to put a dent in poverty
											and to double per capita incomes
in one generation.
											And yet today,
											the largest emerging economies —
											countries with at least
50 million people —
											continue to struggle to reach
that seven percent magic mark.
											Worse than that,
											countries like India, Russia,
South Africa, Brazil and even China
											are falling below
that seven percent number
											and, in many cases, actually regressing.

											Economic growth matters.
											With economic growth,
											countries and societies
enter into a virtuous cycle
											of upward mobility, opportunity

											Without growth,
countries contract and atrophy,
											not just in the annals
of economic statistics
											but also in the meaning of life
and how lives are lived.
											Economic growth matters
powerfully for the individual.
											If growth wanes,
											the risk to human progress

											Economic growth needs capitalism,

											And as I mentioned a moment ago,
											the core of the capitalist system
has been defined by private actors.
											And even this, however,
is a very simplistic dichotomy.
											Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.
											When in practical experience,
											capitalism is much more of a spectrum.
											And we have countries such as China,
											which have practiced
more state capitalism,

like the Unites States

											However, there is

											This is really important
											because this type of capitalism
											has increasingly
been afforded the critique
											that it is now fostering corruption

									<p>
											In order to think about that framing,
we have to ask ourselves,
											how does capitalism work today?
											Very simplistically,
											capitalism is set on the basis
of an individual utility maximizer —
											a selfish individual
who goes after what he or she wants.
											And only after they&#39;ve
maximized their utility
											do they then decide it&#39;s important
											to provide support
to other social contracts.
											Of course, in this system
governments do tax,
											and they use part of their revenues
to fund social programs,
											recognizing that government&#39;s role
is not just regulation
											but also to be arbiter of social goods.
											But nevertheless,
											this framework —
											this two-stage framework —
											is the basis from which we must now start
											to think about how we can
improve the capitalist model.

									<p>
											I would argue that there are
two sides to this challenge.
											First of all,
											we can draw on the right-wing policies
											to see what could be beneficial for us
											to think about how
we can improve capitalism.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In particular,
											right-leaning policies
											have tended to focus on things
like conditional transfers,
											where we pay and reward people
for doing the things
											that we actually think
can help enhance economic growth.
											For example,
											sending children to school,
											parents could earn money for that,
											or getting their children
inoculated or immunized,
											parents could get paid for doing that.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, quite apart from the debate
											on whether or not
we should be paying people
											to do what we think they should do anyway,
											the fact of the matter
is that pay for performance
											has actually yielded some positive results
											in places like Mexico,
											in Brazil
											and also in pilot programs in New York.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But there are also benefits
											and significant changes underway
on left-leaning policies.
											Arguments that government should
expand its role and responsibility
											so that it&#39;s not so narrowly defined
											and that government should be
much more of an arbiter
											of the factors of production
											have become commonplace
with the success of China.
											But also we&#39;ve started to have debates
											about how the role of the private sector
											should move away
from just being a profit motive
											and really be more engaged
in the delivery of social programs.
											Things like the corporate
social responsibility programs,
											albeit small in scale,
											are moving in that right direction.
											Of course, left-leaning policies
have also tended to blur the lines
											between government,
NGOs and private sector.

											that today the largest
economy in the world, the United States,

as it&#39;s core political stance

											to the extent that it is free —

											The second largest economy is China.
											It has deprioritized democracy
											and it has state capitalism,
which is a completely different model.
											These two countries,
completely different political models

											DM: Again, I would be very much
about being open-minded.
											As you&#39;re aware,
											the issues around
the environmental concerns
											have been on the agenda many times now —
											in Copenhagen,
&#39;72 in Stockholm —
											and we keep revisiting these issues
											partly because there is not
a fundamental agreement,
											in fact there&#39;s a schism
											between what the developed
countries believe and want
											and what emerging market countries want.
											Emerging market countries need
to continue to create economic growth
											so that we don&#39;t have political
uncertainty in the those countries.
											Developed countries recognize
											that they have a real,
important responsibility
											not only just to manage
their CO2 emissions
											and some of the degradation
that they&#39;re contributing to the world,
											but also as trendsetters in R&amp;D.
											And so they have to come
to the table as well.
											But in essence, it cannot be a situation
											where we start ascribing policies
to the emerging markets
											without developed countries themselves
											also taking quite a swipe
at what they&#39;re doing
											both in demand and supply
in developed markets.
