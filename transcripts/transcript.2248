<title>Rachel Botsman: We&#39;ve stopped trusting institutions and started trusting strangers | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Something profound is changing our concept of trust, says Rachel Botsman. While we used to place our trust in institutions like governments and banks, today we increasingly rely on others, often strangers, on platforms like Airbnb and Uber and through technologies like the blockchain. This new era of trust could bring with it a more transparent, inclusive and accountable society -- if we get it right. Who do you trust?" />

<meta content='Something profound is changing our concept of trust, says Rachel Botsman. While we used to place our trust in institutions like governments and banks, today we increasingly rely on others, often strangers, on platforms like Airbnb and Uber and through technologies like the blockchain. This new era of trust could bring with it a more transparent, inclusive and accountable society — if we get it right. Who do you trust?' itemprop='description'>

											Let&#39;s start in France with a platform —
with a company, I should say —
											with a rather funny-sounding name,
											BlaBlaCar.
											It&#39;s a platform that matches
drivers and passengers
											who want to share
long-distance journeys together.
											The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.
											So it&#39;s a good idea
to choose your fellow travelers wisely.
											Social profiles and reviews
help people make a choice.
											You can see if someone&#39;s a smoker,
you can see what kind of music they like,
											you can see if they&#39;re going to bring
their dog along for the ride.
											But it turns out
that the key social identifier

											Trust is an elusive concept,
											and yet we depend on it
for our lives to function.
											I trust my children
											when they say they&#39;re going
to turn the lights out at night.
											I trusted the pilot
who flew me here to keep me safe.

											There are, in fact,
hundreds of definitions of trust,
											and most can be reduced
to some kind of risk assessment
											of how likely it is
that things will go right.
											But I don&#39;t like this definition of trust,
											because it makes trust
sound rational and predictable,

to the human essence

											So I define trust a little differently.
											I define trust as a confident

											So my work, my research
focuses on how technology
											is transforming
the social glue of society,
											trust between people,
											and it&#39;s a fascinating area to study,
											because there&#39;s still
so much we do not know.
											For instance, do men and women
trust differently in digital environments?
											Does the way we build trust
face-to-face translate online?
											Does trust transfer?
											So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,
											are you more likely
to trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But from studying hundreds
of networks and marketplaces,
											there is a common pattern
that people follow,
											and I call it &quot;climbing the trust stack.&quot;
											Let me use BlaBlaCar
as an example to bring it to life.
											On the first level,
											you have to trust the idea.
											So you have to trust
											the idea of ride-sharing
is safe and worth trying.
											The second level is about having
confidence in the platform,
											that BlaBlaCar will help you
if something goes wrong.
											And the third level is about
using little bits of information
											to decide whether
the other person is trustworthy.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, the first time
we climb the trust stack,
											it feels weird, even risky,
											but we get to a point
where these ideas seem totally normal.
											Our behaviors transform,
											often relatively quickly.
											In other words, trust enables
change and innovation.

									<p>
											So an idea that intrigued me,
and I&#39;d like you to consider,
											is whether we can better understand
											major waves of disruption and change
in individuals in society
											through the lens of trust.
											Well, it turns out
that trust has only evolved
											in three significant chapters
throughout the course of human history:
											local, institutional
											and what we&#39;re now entering, distributed.

											So for a long time,
											until the mid-1800s,
											trust was built
around tight-knit relationships.
											So say I lived in a village
											with the first five rows of this audience,
											and we all knew one another,
											and say I wanted to borrow money.
											The man who had his eyes wide open,
he might lend it to me,
											and if I didn&#39;t pay him back,
											you&#39;d all know I was dodgy.
											I would get a bad reputation,
											and you would refuse
to do business with me in the future.
											Trust was mostly local
and accountability-based.

											In the mid-19th century,
											society went through
a tremendous amount of change.
											People moved to fast-growing cities
such as London and San Francisco,
											and a local banker here
was replaced by large corporations
											that didn&#39;t know us as individuals.
											We started to place our trust
											into black box systems of authority,
											things like legal contracts
and regulation and insurance,
											and less trust directly in other people.
											Trust became institutional
and commission-based.

											It&#39;s widely talked about how trust
in institutions and many corporate brands
											has been steadily declining
and continues to do so.
											I am constantly stunned
by major breaches of trust:
											the News Corp phone hacking,
											the Volkswagen emissions scandal,
											the widespread abuse
in the Catholic Church,
											the fact that only one measly banker
											went to jail after the great
financial crisis,
											or more recently the Panama Papers
											that revealed how the rich
can exploit offshore tax regimes.
											And the thing that really surprises me
											is why do leaders find it so hard

											It would be easy to conclude
that institutional trust isn&#39;t working
											because we are fed up
											with the sheer audacity

											but what&#39;s happening now
											runs deeper than the rampant questioning
of the size and structure of institutions.
											We&#39;re starting to realize
											that institutional trust
											wasn&#39;t designed for the digital age.
											Conventions of how trust is built,
											managed, lost and repaired —

											The other day, I was talking to the CEO
of a leading international hotel brand,
											and as is often the case,
we got onto the topic of Airbnb.
											And he admitted to me
that he was perplexed by their success.
											He was perplexed at how a company
											that depends on the willingness
of strangers to trust one another
											could work so well across 191 countries.
											So I said to him
that I had a confession to make,
											and he looked at me a bit strangely,
											and I said —
											and I&#39;m sure many of you
do this as well —
											I don&#39;t always bother to hang my towels up
											when I&#39;m finished in the hotel,
											but I would never do this
as a guest on Airbnb.
											And the reason why I would never do this
as a guest on Airbnb
											is because guests know
that they&#39;ll be rated by hosts,
											and that those ratings
are likely to impact their ability
											to transact in the future.
											It&#39;s a simple illustration of how
online trust will change our behaviors
											in the real world,
											make us more accountable
											in ways we cannot yet even imagine.

											I am not saying we do not need hotels
											or traditional forms of authority.
											But what we cannot deny
											is that the way trust
flows through society is changing,
											and it&#39;s creating this big shift
											away from the 20th century
											that was defined by institutional trust
											towards the 21st century
											that will be fueled by distributed trust.
											Trust is no longer top-down.
											It&#39;s being unbundled and inverted.
											It&#39;s no longer opaque and linear.
											A new recipe for trust is emerging
											that once again
is distributed amongst people
											and is accountability-based.

											And this shift is only going to accelerate

											Now let&#39;s be honest,
											getting our heads around
the way blockchain works
											is mind-blowing.
											And one of the reasons why
is it involves processing
											some pretty complicated concepts
											with terrible names.
											I mean, cryptographic algorithms
and hash functions,
											and people called miners,
who verify transactions —
											all that was created
by this mysterious person
											or persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.
											Now, that is a massive trust leap
that hasn&#39;t happened yet.

											But let&#39;s try to imagine this.
											So &quot;The Economist&quot;
eloquently described the blockchain
											as the great chain
of being sure about things.
											The easiest way I can describe it
is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets,
											and they are filled with assets.
											So that could be a property title.
											It could be a stock trade.
											It could be a creative asset,
such as the rights to a song.
											Every time something moves
											from one place on the register
to somewhere else,
											that asset transfer is time-stamped
											and publicly recorded on the blockchain.
											It&#39;s that simple. Right.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the real implication of the blockchain
											is that it removes the need
for any kind of third party,
											such as a lawyer,
											or a trusted intermediary,
or maybe not a government intermediary
											to facilitate the exchange.
											So if we go back to the trust stack,
											you still have to trust the idea,
											you have to trust the platform,
											but you don&#39;t have to trust
the other person
											in the traditional sense.

intentionally to mention Uber,

											and widely overused example,

it&#39;s a great case study.
											Now, we will see cases of abuse

of the trust stack.
											They legitimized the idea
that they were trying to eliminate,
											and sign-ups increased
by 850 percent in 24 hours.
											Now, this is a really strong illustration
											of how once a trust shift has happened
around a behavior or an entire sector,
											you cannot reverse the story.
											Every day, five million people
will take a trust leap
											and ride with Uber.
											In China, on Didi,
the ride-sharing platform,
