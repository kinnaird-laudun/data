<title>Marla Spivak: Why bees are disappearing | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Honeybees have thrived for 50 million years, each colony 40 to 50,000 individuals coordinated in amazing harmony. So why, seven years ago, did colonies start dying en masse? Marla Spivak reveals four reasons which are interacting with tragic consequences. This is not simply a problem because bees pollinate a third of the world&#39;s crops. Could this incredible species be holding up a mirror for us?" />

Marla Spivak reveals four reasons which are interacting with tragic consequences. This is not simply a problem because bees pollinate a third of the world's crops.

											This is our life with bees,
											and this is our life without bees.
											Bees are the most important pollinators
											of our fruits and vegetables and flowers
											and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.
											More than one third of the world&#39;s crop production
											is dependent on bee pollination.
									</p>

									<p>
											But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there
											pollinating our food intentionally.
											They&#39;re out there because they need to eat.
											Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet
											from pollen
											and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.
											They&#39;re flower-feeders,
											and as they move from flower to flower,
											basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,
											they end up providing this valuable pollination service.
											In parts of the world where there are no bees,
											or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,
											people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.
											These people are moving pollen from flower to flower
											with a paintbrush.
											Now this business of hand pollination
											is actually not that uncommon.
											Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers
											with a hand-held vibrator.
											Now this one&#39;s the tomato tickler. (Laughter)
											Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower
											is held very securely within
											the male part of the flower, the anther,
											and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.
											So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world
											that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,
											and they do this by shaking their flight muscles
											at a frequency similar to the musical note C.
											So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,
											and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,
											and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee&#39;s body,
											and she takes it home as food.
											Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies
											inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes
											because they get much more efficient pollination
											when it&#39;s done naturally
											and they get better quality tomatoes.

											So there&#39;s other, maybe more personal reasons,
											to care about bees.
											There&#39;s over 20,000 species of bees in the world,
											and they&#39;re absolutely gorgeous.
											These bees spend the majority of their life cycle
											hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem
											and very few of these beautiful species
											have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.

											Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative
											for the other 19,900-plus species
											because there&#39;s something about honeybees
											that draws people into their world.
											Humans have been drawn to honeybees
											since early recorded history,
											mostly to harvest their honey,
											which is an amazing natural sweetener.

											I got drawn into the honeybee world
											completely by a fluke.
											I was 18 years old and bored,
											and I picked up a book in the library on bees
											and I spent the night reading it.
											I had never thought about insects
											living in complex societies.
											It was like the best of science fiction come true.
											And even stranger, there were these people,
											these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,

											Honeybees can be considered a super-organism,
											where the colony is the organism
											and it&#39;s comprised of 40,000 to 50,000
											individual bee organisms.
											Now this society has no central authority.
											Nobody&#39;s in charge.
											So how they come to collective decisions,
											and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,
											how they communicate where the flowers are,
											all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.
											My personal favorite, and one that I&#39;ve studied for many years,
											is their system of healthcare.
											So bees have social healthcare.
											So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.
											For example, we study hygiene,
											where some bees are able to locate and weed out
											sick individuals from the nest, from the colony,
											and it keeps the colony healthy.
											And more recently, we&#39;ve been studying resins
											that bees collect from plants.
											So bees fly to some plants and they scrape
											these very, very sticky resins off the leaves,
											and they take them back to the nest
											where they cement them into the nest architecture
											where we call it propolis.
											We&#39;ve found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.
											It&#39;s a natural antibiotic.
											It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs
											within the colony,
											and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.
											Humans have known about the power of propolis
											since biblical times.
											We&#39;ve been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies
											for human medicine,
											but we didn&#39;t know how good it was for the bees.
											So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses
											that have kept them healthy and thriving
											for over 50 million years.

											So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies
											were reported to be dying en masse,
											first in the United States,
											it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.
											In our collective conscience, in a really primal way,
											we know we can&#39;t afford to lose bees.
											So what&#39;s going on?
											Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,
											and I&#39;ll go through each of these.
											The bottom line is,
											bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape
											and a dysfunctional food system.

											Now we have the best data on honeybees,
											so I&#39;ll use them as an example.
											In the United States, bees in fact have been
											in decline since World War II.
											We have half the number of managed hives
											in the United States now compared to 1945.
											We&#39;re down to about two million hives of bees, we think.
											And the reason is, after World War II,
											we changed our farming practices.
											We stopped planting cover crops.
											We stopped planting clover and alfalfa,
											which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,
											and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.
											Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.
											And after World War II, we started using herbicides
											to kill off the weeds in our farms.
											Many of these weeds are flowering plants
											that bees require for their survival.
											And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.
											Now we talk about food deserts,
											places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.
											The very farms that used to sustain bees
											are now agricultural food deserts,
											dominated by one or two plant species
											like corn and soybeans.
											Since World War II, we have been systematically
											eliminating many of the flowering plants
											that bees need for their survival.
											And these monocultures extend even to crops
											that are good for bees, like almonds.
											Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,
											hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,
											and also because the pollen in an almond blossom
											is really high in protein. It&#39;s really good for bees.
											Now, the scale of almond monoculture
											demands that most of our nation&#39;s bees,
											over 1.5 million hives of bees,
											be transported across the nation
											to pollinate this one crop.
											And they&#39;re trucked in in semi-loads,
											and they must be trucked out,
											because after bloom, the almond orchards
											are a vast and flowerless landscape.

									<p>
											Bees have been dying over the last 50 years,
											and we&#39;re planting more crops that need them.
											There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production
											that requires bee pollination.

									<p>
											And then there&#39;s pesticides.
											After World War II, we started using pesticides
											on a large scale, and this became necessary
											because of the monocultures that put out a feast
											for crop pests.
											Recently, researchers from Penn State University
											have started looking at the pesticide residue
											in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,
											and they&#39;ve found that every batch of pollen
											that a honeybee collects
											has at least six detectable pesticides in it,
											and this includes every class of insecticides,
											herbicides, fungicides,
											and even inert and unlabeled ingredients
											that are part of the pesticide formulation
											that can be more toxic than the active ingredient.
											This small bee is holding up a large mirror.
											How much is it going to take to contaminate humans?

											One of these class of insecticides,
											the neonicontinoids,
											is making headlines around the world right now.
											You&#39;ve probably heard about it.
											This is a new class of insecticides.
											It moves through the plant so that a crop pest,
											a leaf-eating insect,
											would take a bite of the plant
											and get a lethal dose and die.
											If one of these neonics, we call them,
											is applied in a high concentration,
											such as in this ground application,
											enough of the compound moves through the plant
											and gets into the pollen and the nectar,
											where a bee can consume, in this case,
											a high dose of this neurotoxin
											that makes the bee twitch and die.
											In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,
											it&#39;s only the seed that&#39;s coated with the insecticide,
											and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant
											and gets into the pollen and nectar,
											and if a bee consumes this lower dose,
											either nothing happens
											or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented
											and she may not find her way home.
											And on top of everything else, bees have
											their own set of diseases and parasites.
											Public enemy number one for bees is this thing.
											It&#39;s called varroa destructor.
											It&#39;s aptly named.
											It&#39;s this big, blood-sucking parasite
											that compromises the bee&#39;s immune system
											and circulates viruses.

											Let me put this all together for you.
											I don&#39;t know what it feels like to a bee
											to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,
											and I don&#39;t know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,
											but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,
											and I know how difficult it is for me to get
											to the grocery store to get good nutrition.
											But what if I lived in a food desert?
											And what if I had to travel a long distance
											to get to the grocery store,
											and I finally got my weak body out there
											and I consumed, in my food,
											enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,
											that I couldn&#39;t find my way home?
											And this is what we mean by multiple
											and interacting causes of death.

											And it&#39;s not just our honeybees.
											All of our beautiful wild species of bees

											So what are we going to do?
											What are we going to do about this big bee bummer
											that we&#39;ve created?
											It turns out, it&#39;s hopeful. It&#39;s hopeful.
											Every one of you out there can help bees
											in two very direct and easy ways.
											Plant bee-friendly flowers,
											and don&#39;t contaminate these flowers,
											this bee food, with pesticides.
											So go online and search for flowers
											that are native to your area and plant them.
											Plant them in a pot on your doorstep.
											Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns,
											in your boulevards.
											Campaign to have them planted in public gardens,
											community spaces, meadows.
											Set aside farmland.
											We need a beautiful diversity of flowers
											that blooms over the entire growing season,
											from spring to fall.
											We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees,
											but also for migrating butterflies and birds
											and other wildlife.
											And we need to think carefully about putting back in
											cover crops to nourish our soil
											and nourish our bees.
											And we need to diversify our farms.
											We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows
											to disrupt the agricultural food desert
											and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system
											that we&#39;ve created.

									<p>
											So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure
											to a big, huge problem — just go plant flowers —
											but when bees have access to good nutrition,
											we have access to good nutrition
											through their pollination services.
											And when bees have access to good nutrition,
											they&#39;re better able to engage their own natural defenses,
											their healthcare,
											that they have relied on for millions of years.
											So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me,
											is that every one of us needs to behave
											a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society,
											where each of our individual actions
											can contribute to a grand solution,
											an emergent property,
											that&#39;s much greater than the mere sum
											of our individual actions.
											So let the small act of planting flowers
											and keeping them free of pesticides
											be the driver of large-scale change.

make honey! -- but colonies have been disappearing at alarming rates in many parts of the world due to the accumulated effects of parasitic mites, viral and bacterial diseases, and exposure to pesticides and herbicides. Marla Spivak, University of Minnesota professor of entomology and <a href=\"http://www.macfound.org/fellows/43/\" target=\"_blank\">2010 MacArthur Fellow</a>, tries as much as possible to think like bees in her work to protect them. They&rsquo;re &ldquo;highly social and complex&rdquo; creatures, she says, which fuels her interest and her research.</p> <p>Spivak has developed a strain of bees, the Minnesota Hygienic line, that can detect when pupae are infected and kick them out of the nest, saving the rest of the hive. Now, Spivak is studying how bees collect propolis, or tree resins, in their hives to keep out dirt and microbes. She is also analyzing how flowers&rsquo; decline due to herbicides, pesticides and crop monoculture affect bees&rsquo; numbers and diversity. Spivak has been stung by thousands of bees in the course of her work.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Marla Spivak","tags":["bees","biodiversity","food","garden","insects","science","ecology","plants","agriculture","history","pollution","climate change","big problems","animals","environment","conservation","green","sustainability","botany"],"title":"Why bees are disappearing","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2582399}]}
