											What do you do if you had
to figure out the information
											behind 11.5 million documents,
											verify it and make sense of it?
											That was a challenge
											that a group of journalists
had to face late last year.
											An anonymous person
calling himself John Doe
											had somehow managed to copy
nearly 40 years of records
											of the Panamanian law firm
Mossack Fonseca.
											This is one of many firms around the world
											that specialize in setting up accounts
in offshore tax havens
											like the British Virgin Islands,
											for rich and powerful people
who like to keep secrets.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											John Doe had managed to copy
every spreadsheet from this firm,
											every client file,
											every email,
											from 1977 to the present day.
											It represented the biggest cache
											of inside information
into the tax haven system
											that anyone had ever seen.
											But it also presented a gigantic challenge
to investigative journalism.
											Think about it:
11.5 million documents,
											containing the secrets of people
from more than 200 different countries.
											Where do you start
with such a vast resource?
											Where do you even begin to tell a story
											that can trail off
into every corner of the globe,
											and that can affect almost
any person in any language,
											sometimes in ways
they don&#39;t even know yet.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											John Doe had given the information
to two journalists
											at the German newspaper
Süddeutsche Zeitung.
											He said he was motivated
by — and I quote —
											&quot;The scale of the injustice
that the documents would reveal.&quot;
											But one user alone can never make sense
											of such a vast amount of information.
											So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out
											to my organization in Washington, DC,
											The International Consortium
of Investigative Journalists.
											We decided to do something
that was the very opposite
											of everything we&#39;d been taught
to do as journalists:
											share.

											By nature, investigative
reporters are lone wolves.
											We fiercely guard our secrets,
											at times even from our editors,
											because we know that the moment
we tell them what we have,
											they&#39;ll want that story right away.
											And to be frank,
											when you get a good story,
											you like to keep the glory to yourself.

											But there&#39;s no doubt
that we live in a shrinking world,
											and that the media has largely
been slow to wake up to this.
											The issues we report on
are more and more transnational.
											Giant corporations operate
on a global level.
											Environmental and health
crises are global.
											So, too, are financial flows
and financial crises.
											So it seems staggering
that journalism has been so late
											to cover stories in a truly global way.
											And it also seems staggering
that journalism has been so slow
											to wake up to the possibilities
that technology brings,
											rather than being frightened of it.
											The reason journalists
are scared of technology is this:
											the profession&#39;s largest institutions
are going through tough times
											because of the changing way
that people are consuming news.
											The advertising business models
that have sustained reporting are broken.
											And this has plunged
journalism into crisis,
											forcing those institutions
to reexamine how they function.

											But where there is crisis,
											there is also opportunity.
											The first challenge presented
											by what would eventually become
known as the Panama Papers
											was to make the documents
searchable and readable.
											There were nearly five million emails,
											two million PDFs that needed
to be scanned and indexed,
											and millions more files
and other kinds of documents.
											They all needed to be housed
in a safe and secure location
											in the cloud.
											We next invited reporters
to have a look at the documents.
											In all, reporters from more
than 100 media organizations
											in 76 countries —
											from the BBC in Britain
											to Le Monde newspaper in France
											to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.
											&quot;Native eyes on native names,&quot;
we called it, the idea being,
											who best to tell you
who was important to Nigeria
											than a Nigerian journalist?
											Who best in Canada than a Canadian?
											There were only two rules
for everyone who was invited:
											we all agreed to share everything
that we found with everybody else,
											and we all agreed to publish
together on the same day.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We chose our media partners based on trust
											that had been built up through
previous smaller collaborations
											and also from leads
that jumped out from the documents.
											Over the next few months,
											my small nonprofit organization
of less than 20 people
											was joined by more than 350 other
reporters from 25 language groups.
											The biggest information leak in history
											had now spawned the biggest
journalism collaboration in history:
											376 sets of native eyes doing
what journalists normally never do,
											working shoulder to shoulder,
											sharing information,
											but telling no one.
											For it became clear at this point
											that in order to make
the biggest kind of noise,
											we first needed
the biggest kind of silence.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											To manage the project
over the many months it would take,
											we built a secure virtual newsroom.
											We used encrypted communication systems,
											and we built a specially
designed search engine.
											Inside the virtual newsroom,
											the reporters could gather
around the themes
											that were emerging from the documents.
											Those interested in blood diamonds
or exotic art, for instance,
											could share information about how
the offshore world was being used
											to hide the trade in both
of those commodities.
											Those interested in sport
could share information
											about how famous sports stars
were putting their image rights
											into offshore companies,
											thereby likely avoiding taxes
											in the countries
where they plied their trade.

											But perhaps most exciting of all
											were the number of world leaders
and elect politicians

											close associates

David Cameron, who is linked

											Buried in the documents
were secret offshore entities,
											such as Wintris Inc.,
											a company in the British Virgin Islands
											that had actually belonged
to the sitting Icelandic prime minister.
											I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,
											the Icelandic reporter
we invited to join the project,
											as the loneliest man in the world.
											For nine months, he refused paid work
											and lived off the earnings of his wife.
											He pasted tarps
over the windows of his home
											to prevent prying eyes
during the long Icelandic winter.
											And he soon ran out of excuses
to explain his many absences,
											as he worked red-eyed,
											night after night,
											month after month.
											In all that time, he sat on information
											that would eventually bring down
the leader of his country.

											The Panama Papers quickly became
one of the biggest stories of the year.

the day after we published.

had to resign.

											There&#39;s a kind of irony

that has broken the business model

and old-fashioned journalism techniques
											to vast amounts of leaked information.
											We put all-important context
around what was given to us by John Doe.

											that the collaboration may just be broken

											Gerard Ryle: We had a series
of crises along the way,
											including when something major
was happening in the world,
											the journalists from that country
wanted to publish right away.
											We had to calm them down.
											Probably the biggest crisis we had
was a week before publication.
											We&#39;d sent a series of questions
to the associates of Vladimir Putin,
											but instead of responding,
											the Kremlin actually held
a press conference and denounced us,
											and denounced the whole thing
as being, I guess, a plot from the West.
											At that point, Putin thought
it was just about him.
											And, of course, a lot of editors
around the world
											were very nervous about this.
											They thought the story
was going to get out.
											You can imagine the amount
of time they&#39;d spent,
											the amount of resources,
money spent on this.
											So I had to basically spend
the last week calming everyone down,
											a bit like a general,
where you&#39;re holding your troops back:
											&quot;Calm, remain calm.&quot;
											And then eventually,
of course, they all did.

It was the biggest cross-border collaboration in journalism history. The Panama Papers resulted in resignations or political outcries in Britain, Iceland, Spain, Malta and Pakistan and triggered dozens of official inquires around the world. &nbsp;</p><p>Before joining as the ICIJ&#39;s first non-American director in September 2011, Ryle spent more than 25 years working as an investigative reporter, author and editor in Australia and in Ireland.
