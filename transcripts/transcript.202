											It was an incredible surprise to me
											to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life.
											Because, basically,
											I work as a theoretical physicist.
											I develop and test models of the Big Bang,
											using observational data.
											And I&#39;ve been moonlighting for the last five years
											helping with a project in Africa.
											And, I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge.
											People wonder, you know, &quot;How do you have time to do this?&quot; And so on.
											And so it was simply astonishing to me
											to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides.

									<p>
											So I thought I&#39;d start off by just telling you a little bit about myself
											and why I lead this schizophrenic life.
											Well, I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned
											for resisting the racist regime.
											When they were released, we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania.
											Both were very young countries then,
											and full of hope for the future.

											We had an amazing childhood. We didn&#39;t have any money,
											but we were outdoors most of the time.
											We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world,
											like Kilimanjaro, Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge.
											Well, then we moved to London for high school.
											And after that — there&#39;s nothing much to say about that.
											It was rather dull. But I came back to Africa
											at the age of 17, as a volunteer teacher
											to Lesotho, which is a tiny country,
											surrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa.

											Well, 80 percent of the men in Lesotho
											worked in the mines over the border,
											in brutal conditions.
											Nevertheless, I — as I&#39;m sure — as a rather irritating young, white man
											coming into their village, I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth.
											But the kids were the best part.
											The kids were amazing: extremely eager and often very bright.
											And I&#39;m just going to tell you one story,
											which got through to me.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible,
											to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world.
											And they weren&#39;t used to that.
											But I took them outside one day and I said,
											&quot;I want you to estimate the height of the building.&quot;
											And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall,
											size it up with a finger, and make an estimate of the height.
											But there was one little boy, very small for his age.
											He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village.
											And he wasn&#39;t doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement.
											And so, I said — I was annoyed — I said, &quot;What are you doing?
											I want you to estimate the height of the building.&quot;
											He said, &quot;OK. I measured the height of a brick.
											I counted the number of bricks and now I&#39;m multiplying.&quot;
											Well — (Laughter) — I hadn&#39;t thought of that one.

											And many experiences like this happened to me.
											Another one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three-month leave from the mines.
											Sitting next to him one day, he said, &quot;There&#39;s only one thing that I really loved at school.
											And you know what it was? Shakespeare.&quot; And he recited some to me.
											And these and many similar experiences convinced me
											that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa
											— inventive kids, intellectual kids —
											and starved of opportunity.
											And if Africa is going to get fixed, it&#39;s by them, not by us.
											Well, after — (Applause) — that&#39;s the truth.

											Well, after Lesotho, I traveled across Africa
											before returning to England
											— so gray and depressing, in comparison.
											And I went to Cambridge. And there, I fell for theoretical physics.
											Well, I&#39;m not going to explain this equation,
											but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject.
											We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line.
											And, admittedly, it&#39;s in a very shorthand notation.
											And it contains 18 free parameters,
											OK, which we have to fit to the data.

											So it&#39;s not the final story,
											but it&#39;s an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know
											about nature at the most basic level.
											And apart from a few very important loose ends, which you&#39;ve heard about here —
											like dark energy and dark matter —
											this equation describes,
											seems to describe everything about the universe and what&#39;s in it.

											But there&#39;s one big puzzle remaining,
											and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in
											Tanzania, who&#39;s a wonderful Scottish lady
											who I still stay in touch with.
											And she&#39;s now in her 80s.
											And when I try to explain my work to her, she waved away all the details, and she said,
											&quot;Neil, there&#39;s only one question that really matters.
											What banged?&quot; (Laughter)
											&quot;Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged?&quot;

									<p>
											And she&#39;s right. It&#39;s a question we&#39;ve all been avoiding.
											The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence,
											full of a strange kind of energy
											— inflationary energy — which blew it up.
											But the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state
											is completely unsolved.
											Now, I worked on that theory for a while, with Stephen Hawking and others.
											But then I began to explore another alternative.
											The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn&#39;t the beginning.
											Perhaps the universe existed before the bang,
											and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, this possibility is actually suggested
											by the latest theories, the unified theories,
											which try to explain all those 18 free parameters
											in a single framework, which will hopefully predict all of them.
											And I&#39;ll just share a cartoon of this idea here.
											It&#39;s all I can convey. According to these theories,
											there are extra dimensions of space, not just the three we&#39;re familiar with,
											but at every point in the room there are more dimensions.
											And in particular, there&#39;s one rather strange one,
											in the most elegant unified theories we have.
											The strange one looks likes this:
											that we live in a three-dimensional world.
											We live in one of these worlds, and I can only show it as a sheet,
											but it&#39;s really three-dimensional.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And a tiny distance away, there&#39;s another sheet,
											also three-dimensional, and they&#39;re separated by a gap.
											The gap is very tiny, and I&#39;ve blown it up so you can see it.
											But it&#39;s really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus.
											I won&#39;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this,
											but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know.
											Well, I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question.
											Which is, what happens if these two, three-dimensional worlds
											should actually collide?
											And if they collide, it would look a lot like the Big Bang.
											But it&#39;s slightly different than in the conventional picture.
											The conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point.
											Everything comes out of a point;
											you have infinite density. And all the equations break down.
											No hope of describing that.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In this picture, you&#39;ll notice,
											the bang is extended. It&#39;s not a point.
											The density of matter is finite, and we have a chance
											of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process.
											So, to cut a long story short, we&#39;ve explored this alternative.
											We&#39;ve shown that it can fit
											all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies,
											the fluctuations in the microwave background.
											Furthermore, there&#39;s an experimental way
											to tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before.
											It involves gravitational waves.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And in this scenario, not only was the Big Bang not the beginning,
											as you can see from the picture,
											it can happen over and over again.
											It may be that we live in an endless universe,
											both in space and in time.
											And there&#39;ve been bangs in the past, and there will be bangs in the future.
											And maybe we live in an endless universe.
											Well, making and testing models of the universe
											is, for me, the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe.
											We need to make the best mathematical models we can,
											the most consistent ones.
											And then we scrutinize them, logically and with data.
											And we try to convince ourselves —
											we really try to convince ourselves they&#39;re wrong.
											That&#39;s progress: when we prove things wrong.
											And gradually, we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world.

											As I pursued my career, something was always gnawing away inside me.
											What about Africa?
											What about those kids I&#39;d left behind?
											Instead of developing, as we&#39;d all hoped in the &#39;60s,
											things had gotten worse.
											Africa was gripped by poverty, disease and war.
											This is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project.

											Well, the transition to democracy in South Africa in 1994

											And in 2001, I took a research leave to visit them.

											The ability to make and test models has become essential,
											not only to every single area of science today,
											but also to modern society itself.
											And if you don&#39;t have math, you&#39;re not going to enter the modern age.
											So I had an idea. And the idea was very simple.
											The idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, or AIMS.
											And let&#39;s recruit students from the whole of Africa,
											bring them together with lecturers from all over the world,
											and we&#39;ll try to give them a fantastic education.

											Well, as a Cambridge professor, I had many contacts.
											And to my astonishment, they backed me 100 percent.
											They said, &quot;Go and do it,
											and we&#39;ll come and lecture.&quot;
											And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students
											from these countries — where they don&#39;t have any opportunities — together
											with the best lecturers in the world —
											who I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa —
											and put them together and just let the sparks fly.
											So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town.
											It&#39;s an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s.
											The area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.
											It&#39;s a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it
											and then put out the word:
											we&#39;re going to start the best math institute in Africa
											in this hotel.

											And those of you who haven&#39;t been there, you should go.
											It&#39;s very, very interesting what&#39;s happening.
											And we recruited wonderful staff,
											highly motivated staff.
											The other thing that&#39;s happened, which was good for us, is the Internet.
											Even though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa,
											there are Internet cafes everywhere.
											And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community,

											and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning.
											You have to rethink, what is the university for?
											And that&#39;s really exciting.
											So we designed it to have interactive teaching.
											No droning on at the chalkboard.
											We emphasize problem-solving, working in groups,

											And then they&#39;re up again at eight in the morning.
											Lectures, problem-solving and so on. It&#39;s an extraordinary place.
											We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa&#39;s development,
											because, in those areas, scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage.
											They&#39;ll publish, be invited to conferences.
											They&#39;ll do well. They&#39;ll have successful careers.

											And where they are is indicated over here.
											And where they&#39;ve gone. So these are all postgraduate students.
											And they&#39;ve all gone on to master&#39;s and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places.
											Five students can be educated at AIMS
											for the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe.

											And we summarize them this way:
											the institutes have got to be relevant, innovative,
											cost-effective and high quality. Why?

											Easy to remember the basic rules we need.
											So, just in ending, let me say the only people who can fix Africa
											are talented young Africans.
