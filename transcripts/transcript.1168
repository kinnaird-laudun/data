											Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled,
											because, you see, my father&#39;s name was Ted,
											and much of my life, especially my musical life,
											is really a talk that I&#39;m still having with him,
											or the part of me that he continues to be.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy,
											and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.
											He didn&#39;t read a note,
											and he was profoundly hearing impaired.
											Yet, he was my greatest teacher.
											Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids,
											his understanding of music was profound.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And for him, it wasn&#39;t so much the way the music goes
											as about what it witnesses and where it can take you.
											And he did a painting of this experience,
											which he called &quot;In the Realm of Music.&quot;
											Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising
											in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this.
											(Music)

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But he was tough when it came to music.
											He said, &quot;There are only two things that matter in music:
											what and how.
											And the thing about classical music,
											that what and how, it&#39;s inexhaustible.&quot;
									</p>

											That was his passion for the music.
											Both my parents really loved it.
											They didn&#39;t know all that much about it,
											but they gave me the opportunity to discover it
											together with them.
											And I think inspired by that memory,
											it&#39;s been my desire to try and bring it
											to as many other people as I can,
											sort of pass it on through whatever means.
											And how people get this music, how it comes into their lives,
											really fascinates me.

											One day in New York, I was on the street
											and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.
											And a tough, slouchy kid got up to bat,
											and he took a swing and really connected.
											And he watched the ball fly for a second,
											and then he went, &quot;Dah dadaratatatah.
											Brah dada dadadadah.&quot;
											And he ran around the bases.
											And I thought, go figure.
											How did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment
											turn into the victory crow of this New York kid?
											How was that passed on? How did he get to hear Mozart?

									<p>
											Well when it comes to classical music,
											there&#39;s an awful lot to pass on,
											much more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.
											Because classical music
											is an unbroken living tradition
											that goes back over 1,000 years.
											And every one of those years
											has had something unique and powerful to say to us
											about what it&#39;s like to be alive.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the raw material of it, of course,
											is just the music of everyday life.
											It&#39;s all the anthems and dance crazes
											and ballads and marches.
											But what classical music does
											is to distill all of these musics down,
											to condense them to their absolute essence,
											and from that essence create a new language,
											a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly
											about who we really are.
											It&#39;s a language that&#39;s still evolving.

									<p>
											Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of,
											like concertos and symphonies,
											but even the most ambitious masterpiece
											can have as its central mission
											to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment —
											like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
											(Music)
											It&#39;s so simple, so evocative.
											So many emotions seem to be inside of it.
											Yet, of course, like all music,
											it&#39;s essentially not about anything.
											It&#39;s just a design of pitches and silence and time.

											And the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations.

											And whether we call them 440 per second, A,

											they&#39;re just phenomena.
											But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena

											And in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately
											because of the music&#39;s powerful silent partner,
											the way it&#39;s been passed on: notation.
											Now the impulse to notate,
											or, more exactly I should say, encode music
											has been with us for a very long time.
											In 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos
											wrote this song for his departed wife
											and inscribed it on her gravestone
											in the notational system of the Greeks.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And a thousand years later,
											this impulse to notate took an entirely different form.
											And you can see how this happened
											in these excerpts from the Christmas mass &quot;Puer Natus est nobis,&quot;
											&quot;For Us is Born.&quot;
											(Music)
											In the 10th century, little squiggles were used
											just to indicate the general shape of the tune.
											And in the 12th century, a line was drawn, like a musical horizon line,
											to better pinpoint the pitch&#39;s location.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of notes
											locked in the concept of the tune exactly,
											and that led to the kind of notation we have today.
											Well notation not only passed the music on,
											notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely,
											because it enabled the musicians
											to imagine music on a much vaster scale.

											Now inspired moves of improvisation
											could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized,
											made into intricate designs.
											And from this moment, classical music became
											what it most essentially is,
											a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature:
											instinct and intelligence.

											And there began to be a real difference at this point
											between the art of improvisation
											and the art of composition.
											Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move,
											but a composer is considering all possible moves,
											testing them out, prioritizing them out,
											until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design
											of ultimate and enduring coolness.
											Now some of the greatest composers, like Bach,
											were combinations of these two things.
											Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.
											Mozart was the same way.

											But every musician strikes a different balance
											between faith and reason, instinct and intelligence.
											And every musical era had different priorities of these things,
											different things to pass on, different &#39;whats&#39; and &#39;hows&#39;.
											So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition
											the big &#39;what&#39; was to praise God.
											And by the 1400s, music was being written
											that tried to mirror God&#39;s mind
											as could be seen in the design of the night sky.
											The &#39;how&#39; was a style called polyphony,
											music of many independently moving voices
											that suggested the way the planets seemed to move
											in Ptolemy&#39;s geocentric universe.
											This was truly the music of the spheres.

											MTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera,
											and its development put music on a radical new course.
											The what now was not to mirror the mind of God,
											but to follow the emotion turbulence of man.
											And the how was harmony,
											stacking up the pitches to form chords.

											And the chords, it turned out,
											were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions.
											And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us,
											the triads,
											either the major one,
											which we think is happy,
											or the minor one,
											which we perceive as sad.
											But what&#39;s the actual difference between these two chords?
											It&#39;s just these two notes in the middle.
											It&#39;s either E natural,
											and 659 vibrations per second,
											or E flat, at 622.
											So the big difference between human happiness and sadness?

											So you can see in a system like this
											there was enormous subtle potential

											Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions

											Now with all this possibility,

											It&#39;s the time in which the big forms began to arise.
											And the effects of technology began to be felt also,

											into the hands of performers everywhere.
											And new and improved instruments

											basically witnessing how it was possible

											To me this is the intimate, personal side of music.
											It&#39;s the passing on part. It&#39;s the &#39;why&#39; part of it.
											And to me that&#39;s the most essential of all.
											Mostly it&#39;s been a person-to-person thing,
											a teacher-student, performer-audience thing,
											and then around 1880 came this new technology
											that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally
											created a new and miraculous way of passing things on,
											albeit an impersonal one.

											And I suddenly got it,
											and I said, &quot;Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?&quot;
											(Music)
											And he said, &quot;Yes, yes. I was a little boy.
											The symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it.&quot;
											And I thought, my God,
											how much must this music mean to this man
											that he would get himself out of his bed, across the room
											to recover the memory of this music
											that, after everything else in his life is sloughing away,
											still means so much to him?

But his legacy won&#39;t stop at his Grammy-winning recordings of the complete Mahler symphony cycle with his home orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony. He&#39;s also the founder of the New World Symphony, an orchestra that helps to educate young and gifted musicians as obsessed with their craft as he. Since its establishment in 1987, New World Symphony has launched the careers of more than 700 young musicians, and in its new Miami Beach concert hall designed by Frank Gehry, it&#39;s bringing well-played classical music to a truly popular audience.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>He&#39;s the guest conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra -- and the artistic director of the YouTube Symphony Orchestra (YTSO), a 96-member ensemble selected from online video auditions. Tilson Thomas conducted the YTSO at Carnegie Hall in 2009 and in 2011 in Sydney, Australia. And he&#39;s the creator of the Keeping Score education program for public schools, which uses PBS TV, web, radio and DVDs, and a K-12 curriculum to make classical music more accessible. In 2010, Tilson Thomas was awarded the National Medal of Arts, the highest award given to artists by the US government.</div><div><br /></div>"}],"speaker_name":"Michael Tilson Thomas","tags":["culture","entertainment","history","music","live music"],"title":"Music and emotion through time","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1384764}]}
