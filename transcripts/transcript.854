<meta content='"If I should have a daughter, instead of Mom, she&#x0027;s gonna call me Point B ... " began spoken word poet Sarah Kay, in a talk that inspired two standing ovations at TED2011. She tells the story of her metamorphosis — from a wide-eyed teenager soaking in verse at New York&#x0027;s Bowery Poetry Club to a teacher connecting kids with the power of self-expression through Project V.O.I.C.E. — and gives two breathtaking performances of "B" and "Hiroshima."' itemprop='description'>

you stretch your fingers,

in the air like that.
											I know that trick;
I&#39;ve done it a million times.
											You&#39;re just smelling for smoke

back to a burning house,
											so you can find the boy
who lost everything in the fire
											to see if you can save him.
											Or else find the boy who lit
the fire in the first place,
											to see if you can change him.
											But I know she will anyway,

											When I was a freshman in high school,
											I was a live wire of nervous hormones.
											And I was underdeveloped
and over-excitable.
											And despite my fear
											of ever being looked at for too long,
											I was fascinated by the idea
of spoken-word poetry.
											I felt that my two secret loves,
poetry and theater,
											had come together, had a baby,
											a baby I needed to get to know.
											So I decided to give it a try.
											My first spoken-word poem,
											packed with all the wisdom
of a 14-year-old,
											was about the injustice
											of being seen as unfeminine.
											The poem was very indignant,
											and mainly exaggerated,
											but the only spoken-word poetry
that I had seen up until that point
											was mainly indignant,
											so I thought
that&#39;s what was expected of me.

											The first time that I performed,
											the audience of teenagers hooted
and hollered their sympathy,
											and when I came off the stage,
I was shaking.
											I felt this tap on my shoulder,
											and I turned around to see
											this giant girl in a hoodie
sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.
											She was maybe eight feet tall
											and looked like she could
beat me up with one hand,
											but instead she just nodded
at me and said,
											&quot;Hey, I really felt that. Thanks.&quot;

											to soak in every ounce

											I was the youngest by at least a decade,

share their stories,

											or serious or silly.
											The Bowery Poetry Club became
my classroom and my home,
											and the poets who performed
											encouraged me to share my stories as well.
											Never mind the fact that I was 14.
											They told me, &quot;Write about being 14.&quot;
											So I did and stood amazed every week
											when these brilliant, grown-up poets
											laughed with me and groaned their sympathy

&quot;Hey, I really felt that too.&quot;

											Now I can divide my spoken-word journey

											And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.
											Step two was the moment I said,
											&quot;I will. I will continue.
											I love spoken word. I will keep
coming back week after week.&quot;
											And step three began
											when I realized I didn&#39;t have
to write indignant poems,
											if that&#39;s not what I was.
											There were things
that were specific to me,
											and the more that I focused
on those things,
											the weirder my poetry got,
											but the more that it felt like mine.
											It&#39;s not just the adage
&quot;Write what you know.&quot;
											It&#39;s about gathering up
all of the knowledge and experience
											you&#39;ve collected up to now
											to help you dive into the things
you don&#39;t know.
											I use poetry to help me work

of everywhere else that I&#39;ve been.

											When I was in high school I had

											this time changing the mission
											to using spoken-word poetry
as a way to entertain,
											educate and inspire.
											We stayed full-time students,

											cracks open locks.
											But it turns out sometimes,
poetry can be really scary.
											Turns out sometimes,
											you have to trick teenagers
into writing poetry.
											So I came up with lists.
Everyone can write lists.
											And the first list that I assign
											is &quot;10 Things I Know to be True.&quot;
											And here&#39;s what happens,
you would discover it too
											if we all started sharing
our lists out loud.
											At a certain point, you would realize
that someone has the exact same thing,
											or one thing very similar,
											to something on your list.
											And then someone else
											has something the complete
opposite of yours.
											Third, someone has something
you&#39;ve never even heard of before.
											Fourth, someone has something
you thought you knew everything about,
											but they&#39;re introducing
a new angle of looking at it.
											And I tell people that this is
where great stories start from —
											these four intersections
											of what you&#39;re passionate about
											and what others might be invested in.

											And most people respond
really well to this exercise.
											But one of my students,
a freshman named Charlotte,
											was not convinced.
											Charlotte was very good at writing lists,
but she refused to write any poems.
											&quot;Miss,&quot; she&#39;d say,
&quot;I&#39;m just not interesting.
											I don&#39;t have anything interesting to say.&quot;
											So I assigned her list after list,
											and one day I assigned the list
											&quot;10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now.&quot;
											Number three on Charlotte&#39;s list was,
											&quot;I should have learned
not to crush on guys
											three times my age.&quot;
											I asked her what that meant,
											and she said, &quot;Miss,
it&#39;s kind of a long story.&quot;
											And I said, &quot;Charlotte, it sounds
pretty interesting to me.&quot;
											And so she wrote her first poem,
											a love poem unlike any
I had ever heard before.
											And the poem began,
											&quot;Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man.&quot;

											It&#39;s not that I think
that spoken-word poetry
											is the ideal art form.
											I&#39;m always trying to find
the best way to tell each story.
											I write musicals; I make short films
alongside my poems.
											But I teach spoken-word poetry
											because it&#39;s accessible.
											Not everyone can read music
or owns a camera,
											but everyone can communicate in some way,
											and everyone has stories
that the rest of us can learn from.
											Plus, spoken-word poetry allows
for immediate connection.
											It&#39;s not uncommon
to feel like you&#39;re alone
											or that nobody understands you,
											but spoken word teaches
											that if you have the ability
to express yourself
											and the courage to present
those stories and opinions,
											you could be rewarded
											with a room full of your peers,
											or your community, who will listen.
											And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie
											who will connect with what you&#39;ve shared.
											And that is an amazing
realization to have,
											especially when you&#39;re 14.
											Plus, now with YouTube,
											that connection&#39;s not even limited
to the room we&#39;re in.
											I&#39;m so lucky that there&#39;s

											but I was very lucky with Charlotte,
											that I got to watch her journey
unfold the way it did.
											I watched her realize
											that, by putting the things that she knows
to be true into the work she&#39;s doing,
											she can create poems
that only Charlotte can write,
											about eyeballs and elevators
and Dora the Explorer.
											And I&#39;m trying to tell
stories only I can tell —
											like this story.
											I spent a lot of time thinking
about the best way to tell this story,
											and I wondered if the best way
											was going to be
a PowerPoint, a short film —
											And where exactly was the beginning,
the middle or the end?
											I wondered whether I&#39;d get
to the end of this talk
											and finally have
figured it all out, or not.

											And I always thought that my beginning
was at the Bowery Poetry Club,
											but it&#39;s possible
that it was much earlier.
											In preparing for TED,
											I discovered this diary page
in an old journal.
											I think December 54th
was probably supposed to be 24th.
											It&#39;s clear that when I was a child,
											I definitely walked
through life like this.
											I think that we all did.
											I would like to help others
rediscover that wonder —
											to want to engage with it,
to want to learn,
											to want to share what they&#39;ve learned,
											what they&#39;ve figured out to be true
											and what they&#39;re still figuring out.

											When they bombed Hiroshima,
											the explosion formed a mini-supernova,
											so every living animal, human or plant
											that received direct contact
with the rays from that sun
											was instantly turned to ash.
											And what was left
of the city soon followed.
											The long-lasting damage
of nuclear radiation
											caused an entire city and its population
											to turn into powder.
											When I was born, my mom says
I looked around the whole hospital room
											with a stare that said,
&quot;This? I&#39;ve done this before.&quot;
											She says I have old eyes.
											When my Grandpa Genji died,
I was only five years old,
											but I took my mom
by the hand and told her,
											&quot;Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;ll come back as a baby.&quot;
											And yet, for someone
who&#39;s apparently done this already,
											I still haven&#39;t figured anything out yet.
											My knees still buckle
every time I get on a stage.
											My self-confidence can be measured out
											in teaspoons mixed into my poetry,
											and it still always
tastes funny in my mouth.
											But in Hiroshima, some people
were wiped clean away,
											leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.
											So no matter that I have inhibitions
to fill all my pockets,
											I keep trying,
											hoping that one day I&#39;ll write a poem
											I can be proud to let sit
in a museum exhibit
											as the only proof I existed.
											My parents named me Sarah,
which is a biblical name.
											In the original story, God told Sarah
she could do something impossible, and —
											she laughed,
											because the first Sarah,
											she didn&#39;t know what to do
with impossible.
											And me?
											Well, neither do I,
											but I see the impossible every day.
											Impossible is trying
to connect in this world,
											trying to hold onto others while things
are blowing up around you,
											knowing that while you&#39;re speaking,
											they aren&#39;t just waiting for their turn
to talk — they hear you.
											They feel exactly what you feel
											at the same time that you feel it.
											It&#39;s what I strive for every time
I open my mouth —
											that impossible connection.
											There&#39;s this piece of wall in Hiroshima
											that was completely burnt
black by the radiation.
											But on the front step,
a person who was sitting there
											blocked the rays from hitting the stone.
											The only thing left now
											is a permanent shadow of positive light.
											After the A-bomb,
											specialists said it would take 75 years
											for the radiation-damaged
soil of Hiroshima City
											to ever grow anything again.
											But that spring, there were
new buds popping up from the earth.
											When I meet you, in that moment,
											I&#39;m no longer a part of your future.
											I start quickly becoming
part of your past.
											But in that instant,
I get to share your present.
											And you, you get to share mine.
											And that is the greatest present of all.
											So if you tell me
I can do the impossible —
											I&#39;ll probably laugh at you.
											I don&#39;t know if I can change
the world yet,
											because I don&#39;t know that much about it —
											and I don&#39;t know that much
about reincarnation either,
											but if you make me laugh hard enough,
											sometimes I forget what century I&#39;m in.
											This isn&#39;t my first time here.
This isn&#39;t my last time here.
											These aren&#39;t the last words I&#39;ll share.
											But just in case, I&#39;m trying my hardest
											to get it right this time around.
