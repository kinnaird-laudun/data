											What if I told you
there was a new technology
											that, when placed in the hands
of doctors and nurses,
											improved outcomes for children
and adults, patients of all ages;
											reduced pain and suffering,
											reduced time in the operating rooms,
											reduced anesthetic times,
											had the ultimate dose-response curve
											that the more you did it,
											the better it benefitted patients?
											Here&#39;s a kicker: it has no side effects,
											and it&#39;s available no matter
where care is delivered.
											I can tell you as an ICU doctor
at Boston Children&#39;s Hospital,
											this would be a game changer for me.
											That technology is lifelike rehearsal.
											This lifelike rehearsal is being delivered
through medical simulation.

									<p>
											I thought I would start with a case,
											just to really describe
the challenge ahead,
											and why this technology is not just
going to improve health care
											but why it&#39;s critical to health care.
											This is a child that&#39;s born, young girl.
											&quot;Day of life zero,&quot; we call it,
											the first day of life,
just born into the world.
											And just as she&#39;s being born,
											we notice very quickly
that she is deteriorating.
											Her heart rate is going up,
her blood pressure is going down,
											she&#39;s breathing very, very fast.
											And the reason for this
is displayed in this chest X-ray.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That&#39;s called a babygram,
											a full X-ray of a child&#39;s body,
a little infant&#39;s body.
											As you look on the top side of this,
											that&#39;s where the heart and lungs
are supposed to be.
											As you look at the bottom end,
that&#39;s where the abdomen is,
											and that&#39;s where the intestines
are supposed to be.
											And you can see how
there&#39;s sort of that translucent area
											that made its way up into the right side
of this child&#39;s chest.
											And those are the intestines —
in the wrong place.
											As a result, they&#39;re pushing on the lungs
											and making it very difficult
for this poor baby to breathe.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The fix for this problem
											is to take this child immediately
to the operating room,
											bring those intestines
back into the abdomen,
											let the lungs expand
											and allow this child to breathe again.
											But before she can go
to the operating room,
											she must get whisked away
to the ICU, where I work.
											I work with surgical teams.
											We gather around her,
											and we place this child
on heart-lung bypass.
											We put her to sleep,
											we make a tiny
little incision in the neck,
											we place catheters into the major
vessels of the neck —
											and I can tell you that these vessels
are about the size of a pen,
											the tip of a pen —
											and then we have blood
drawn from the body,
											we bring it through a machine,
it gets oxygenated,
											and it goes back into the body.
											We save her life,
											and get her safely to the operating room.

									<p>
											Here&#39;s the problem:
											these disorders —
											what is known is congenital
diaphragmatic hernia —
											this hole in the diaphragm that has
allowed these intestines to sneak up —
											these disorders are rare.
											Even in the best hands in the world,
											there is still a challenge
to get the volume —
											the natural volume of these patients —
											in order to get our expertise
curve at 100 percent.
											They just don&#39;t present that often.
											So how do you make the rare common?

									<p>
											Here&#39;s the other problem:
											in the health care system
that I trained for over 20 years,
											what currently exists,
											the model of training is called
the apprenticeship model.
											It&#39;s been around for centuries.
											It&#39;s based on this idea that you see
a surgery maybe once,
											maybe several times,
											you then go do that surgery,
											and then ultimately you teach
that surgery to the next generation.
											And implicit in this model —
											I don&#39;t need to tell you this —
											is that we practice on the very patients
that we are delivering care to.
											That&#39;s a problem.
											I think there&#39;s a better approach.
											Medicine may very well be the last
high-stakes industry
											that does not practice prior to game time.
											I want to describe to you a better
approach through medical simulation.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, the first thing we did is we went
to other high-stakes industries
											that had been using this type
of methodology for decades.
											This is nuclear power.
											Nuclear power runs scenarios
on a regular basis
											in order to practice
what they hope will never occur.
											And as we&#39;re all very familiar,
the airline industry —
											we all get on planes now,
comforted by the idea
											that pilots and crews have trained
on simulators much like these,
											training on scenarios
that we hope will never occur,
											but we know if they did,
											they would be prepared for the worst.
											In fact, the airline industry has gone
as far as to create fuselages
											of simulation environments,
											because of the importance
of the team coming together.
											This is an evacuation drill simulator.
											So again, if that ever were to happen,
these rare, rare events,
											they&#39;re ready to act
on the drop of a dime.

											I guess the most compelling for me
in some ways is the sports industry —
											arguably high stakes.
											You think about a baseball team:
baseball players practice.
											I think it&#39;s a beautiful example
of progressive training.
											The first thing they do
is go out to spring training.
											They go to a spring training camp,
											perhaps a simulator in baseball.
											They&#39;re not on the real field,
but they&#39;re on a simulated field,
											and they&#39;re playing in the pregame season.
											Then they make their way to the field
during the season games,
											and what&#39;s the first thing they do
before they start the game?
											They go into the batting cage
and do batting practice for hours,
											having different types of pitches
being thrown at them,
											hitting ball after ball
as they limber their muscles,
											getting ready for the game itself.
											And here&#39;s the most
phenomenal part of this,
											and for all of you who watch
any sport event,
											you will see this phenomenon happen.
											The batter gets into the batter&#39;s box,
											the pitcher gets ready to pitch.
											Right before the pitch is thrown,
											what does that batter do?
											The batter steps out of the box
											and takes a practice swing.
											He wouldn&#39;t do it any other way.

											I want to talk to you about how
we&#39;re building practice swings like this
											in medicine.
											We are building batting cages
for the patients that we care about
											at Boston Children&#39;s.
											I want to use this case
that we recently built.
											It&#39;s the case of a four-year-old
who had a progressively enlarging head,
											and as a result,
											had loss of developmental milestones,
neurologic milestones,
											and the reason for this problem is here —
											it&#39;s called hydrocephalus.

											So, a quick study in neurosurgery.
											There&#39;s the brain,
											and you can see the cranium
surrounding the brain.
											What surrounds the brain,
between the brain and cranium,
											is something called
cerebrospinal fluid or fluid,
											which acts as a shock absorber.
											In your heads right now,
											there is cerebrospinal fluid
just bathing your brains
											and making its way around.
											It&#39;s produced in one area
and flows through,
											and then is re-exchanged.
											And this beautiful flow pattern
occurs for all of us.
											But unfortunately in some children,
											there&#39;s a blockage of this flow pattern,
											much like a traffic jam.
											As a result, the fluid accumulates,
											and the brain is pushed aside.
											It has difficulty growing.
											As a result, the child loses
neurologic milestones.
											This is a devastating disease in children.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The cure for this is surgery.
											The traditional surgery is to take
a bit of the cranium off,
											a bit of the skull,
											drain this fluid out,
stick a drain in place,
											and then eventually bring
this drain internal to the body.
											Big operation.
											But some great news is that advances
in neurosurgical care
											have allowed us to develop
minimally invasive approaches
											to this surgery.
											Through a small pinhole,
a camera can be inserted,
											led into the deep brain structure,
											and cause a little hole in a membrane
that allows all that fluid to drain,
											much like it would in a sink.
											All of a sudden, the brain
is no longer under pressure,
											can re-expand
											and we cure the child
through a single-hole incision.

											But here&#39;s the problem:
											hydrocephalus is relatively rare.
											And there are no good training methods
											to get really good at getting
this scope to the right place.
											But surgeons have been quite creative
about this, even our own.
											And they&#39;ve come up with training models.
											Here&#39;s the current training model.

of doing this surgery.

that reproduced child —

bring the child into the operating room.

Weinstock is a practicing pediatric intensive care unit physician at Boston Children&#39;s Hospital, where he serves as Senior Associate in Critical Care Medicine, Associate Professor of Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School, Chair of Pediatric Simulation and Director of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://simpeds.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Children&#39;s Hospital Simulator Program</a>&nbsp;(SIMPeds). Weinstock works with his team of educators, psychologists, engineers, animators, special effects designers and 3D printers to immerse doctors, nurses, patients and their families in Hollywood-style &quot;life-like&quot; experiences -- all to optimize performance, clinical outcomes, as well as the entire healthcare journey for children and their families.</p><p>Weinstock received his PhD from Rockefeller University in molecular and cell biology, followed by clinical training in plastic and general surgery at the University of Pittsburgh and general pediatrics and critical care medicine at the Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital. His passion is in developing methods that link highly realistic practice and preparedness training directly to the delivery of high quality, safe care to improve the lives of infants, children and their families. Due to its inherent emotionality, Weinstock&#39;s approach to simulation is keenly connected to emotionality and behavioral psychology as essential elements of relationships and decision-making to understand and optimize human-human and human-technology interactions. Weinstock&nbsp;has rapidly grown SIMPeds to thousands of simulations per year, and the SIMPeds method has been adopted among pediatric teaching centers around the globe.</p><p>Weinstock frequently lectures internationally on state of art simulation and experiential learning, and he has published sentinel articles in innovative application and approaches to simulation -- from human factors to engineering and testing of next generation of ultra-realistic training devices. He has chaired meetings worldwide and is Founding President of the International Pediatric Simulation Society.&nbsp;</p><div><br /></div>"}],"speaker_name":"Peter Weinstock","tags":["brain","future","children","health care","medicine","innovation","teaching","technology","education","TEDx","Surgery"],"title":"Lifelike simulations that make real-life surgery safer","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":980933}]}
