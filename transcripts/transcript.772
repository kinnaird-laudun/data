											I&#39;m here today to show
my photographs of the Lakota.
											Many of you may have heard of the Lakota,
											or at least the larger group of tribes,
											called the Sioux.
											The Lakota are one of many tribes
that were moved off their land
											to prisoner-of-war camps,
											now called reservations.
											The Pine Ridge Reservation,
											the subject of today&#39;s slide show,
											is located about 75 miles southeast
of the Black Hills in South Dakota.
											It is sometimes referred to
as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,
											and it is where the Lakota now live.
											Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,
											the American Indian Movement,
											or of Russell Means,
											or Leonard Peltier,
											or of the standoff at Oglala,
											then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero
for Native issues in the US.

											So I&#39;ve been asked to talk
a little bit today
											about my relationship with the Lakota,
											and that&#39;s a very difficult one for me,
											because, if you haven&#39;t
noticed from my skin color,
											I&#39;m white,
											and that is a huge barrier
on a Native reservation.
											You&#39;ll see a lot of people
in my photographs today.
											I&#39;ve become very close with them,
and they&#39;ve welcomed me like family.
											They&#39;ve called me &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;uncle,&quot;
											and invited me again and again
over five years.
											But on Pine Ridge,
											I will always be what is called &quot;wasichu.&quot;
											&quot;Wasichu&quot; is a Lakota word
											that means &quot;non-Indian,&quot;
											but another version of this word
											means &quot;the one who takes
the best meat for himself.&quot;
											And that&#39;s what I want to focus on —
											the one who takes
the best part of the meat.
											It means &quot;greedy.&quot;

											So take a look around
this auditorium today.
											We are at a private school
in the American West,
											sitting in red velvet chairs
											with money in our pockets.
											And if we look at our lives,
											we have indeed taken
the best part of the meat.
											So let&#39;s look today
at a set of photographs
											of a people who lost
											so that we could gain,
											and know that when you see
these people&#39;s faces,
											that these are not just
images of the Lakota;
											they stand for all indigenous people.

											On this piece of paper
											is the history the way I learned it
from my Lakota friends and family.
											The following is a time line
of treaties made, treaties broken
											and massacres disguised as battles.
											I&#39;ll begin in 1824.
											What is known as
the Bureau of Indian Affairs
											was created within the War Department,
											setting an early tone of aggression
											in our dealings with the Native Americans.

											1851:
											The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made,
											clearly marking the boundaries
of the Lakota Nation.
											According to the treaty,
those lands are a sovereign nation.
											If the boundaries
of this treaty had held —
											and there is a legal basis
that they should —
											then this is what the US
would look like today.
											Ten years later.
											The Homestead Act,
signed by President Lincoln,
											unleashed a flood of white settlers
into Native lands.

											1866: The beginning
of the Transcontinental Railroad —
											a new era.
											We appropriated land for trails and trains
											to shortcut through the heart
of the Lakota Nation.
											The treaties were out the window.
											In response, three tribes led
by the Lakota chief Red Cloud
											attacked and defeated the US army,
											many times over.

											1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty

											1890: A date I believe to be
the most important in this slide show.
											This is the year
of the Wounded Knee Massacre.
											On December 29,
											US troops surrounded a Sioux
encampment at Wounded Knee Creek,
											and massacred Chief Big Foot
and 300 prisoners of war,
											using a new rapid-fire weapon
that fired exploding shells,
											called a Hotchkiss gun.
											For this so-called &quot;battle,&quot;
											20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor
											were given to the 7th Cavalry.
											To this day,
											this is the most Medals of Honor
ever awarded for a single battle.
											More Medals of Honor were given
											for the indiscriminate slaughter
of women and children
											than for any battle in World War One,
											World War Two,
											Korea, Vietnam,
											Iraq or Afghanistan.

											The Wounded Knee Massacre
is considered the end of the Indian wars.
											Whenever I visit the site
of the mass grave at Wounded Knee,
											I see it not just as a grave
for the Lakota or for the Sioux,
											but as a grave for all indigenous peoples.
											The holy man Black Elk, said,

											When I look back now
from this high hill of my old age,
											I can still see
the butchered women and children
											lying heaped and scattered
all along the crooked gulch,
											as plain as when I saw them
											with eyes still young.

declared its position on Native rights.

											Fast-forward.
											1980:
											The longest-running
court case in US history,
											the Sioux Nation versus the United States,
											was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court.
											The court determined that when the Sioux
were resettled onto reservations
											and seven million acres
of their land were opened up
											to prospectors and homesteaders,
											the terms of the second
Fort Laramie Treaty
											had been violated.
											The court stated that the Black Hills
were illegally taken,
											and that the initial
offering price, plus interest,
											should be paid to the Sioux Nation.
											As payment for the Black Hills,
											the court awarded only 106 million dollars
to the Sioux Nation.
											The Sioux refused the money
with the rallying cry,
											&quot;The Black Hills are not for sale.&quot;

											2010:
											Statistics about Native population today,
											more than a century
after the massacre at Wounded Knee,
											reveal the legacy of colonization,
											forced migration
											and treaty violations.
											Unemployment on the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation
											fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent.
											The housing office is unable
to build new structures,
											and existing structures are falling apart.
											Many are homeless,
											and those with homes
are packed into rotting buildings
											with up to five families.
											Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge
											have no electricity.
											At least 60 percent
of the homes on the reservation
											are infested with black mold.
											More than 90 percent of the population
lives below the federal poverty line.
											The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge
											is approximately eight times higher
than the US national average.
											The infant mortality rate
is the highest on this continent,
											and is about three times higher
than the US national average.
											Cervical cancer is five times higher
											than the US national average.
											The school dropout rate
is up to 70 percent.
											Teacher turnover is eight times higher
than the US national average.
											Frequently, grandparents
are raising their grandchildren
											because parents, due to alcoholism,
											domestic violence and general apathy,
											cannot raise them.
											Fifty percent of the population
over the age of 40
											suffers from diabetes.
											The life expectancy for men
is between 46 and 48 years old —
											roughly the same
as in Afghanistan and Somalia.
