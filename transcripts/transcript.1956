									<p>
											About 10 years ago, I went through
a little bit of a hard time.
											So I decided to go see a therapist.
											I had been seeing her for a few months,
when she looked at me one day and said,
											&quot;Who actually raised you
until you were three?&quot;
											Seemed like a weird question.
I said, &quot;My parents.&quot;
											And she said, &quot;I don&#39;t think
that&#39;s actually the case;
											because if it were,
											we&#39;d be dealing with things that are
far more complicated than just this.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											It sounded like the setup to a joke,
but I knew she was serious.
											Because when I first started seeing her,
											I was trying to be
the funniest person in the room.
											And I would try and crack these jokes,
but she caught on to me really quickly,
											and whenever I tried to make a joke,
she would look at me and say,
											&quot;That is actually really sad.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											It&#39;s terrible.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I knew I had to be serious,
and I asked my parents
											who had actually raised me
until I was three?
											And to my surprise, they said
											my primary caregiver had been
a distant relative of the family.
											I had called her my auntie.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I remember my auntie so clearly,
											it felt like she had been part of my life
when I was much older.
											I remember the thick, straight hair,
											and how it would come around
me like a curtain
											when she bent to pick me up;
											her soft, southern Thai accent;
											the way I would cling to her,
											even if she just wanted to go
to the bathroom
											or get something to eat.
											I loved her, but [with] the ferocity
that a child has sometimes
											before she understands that love
also requires letting go.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But my clearest and sharpest
memory of my auntie,
											is also one of my first
memories of life at all.
											I remember her being beaten and slapped
by another member of my family.
											I remember screaming hysterically
and wanting it to stop,
											as I did every single time it happened,
											for things as minor as wanting
to go out with her friends,
											or being a little late.
											I became so hysterical over her treatment,
											that eventually, she was just
beaten behind closed doors.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Things got so bad for her
that eventually she ran away.
											As an adult, I learned later
											that she had been just 19
when she was brought over from Thailand
											to the States to care for me,
on a tourist visa.
											She wound up working
in Illinois for a time,
											before eventually returning to Thailand,
											which is where I ran into her again,
at a political rally in Bangkok.
											I clung to her again, as I had
when I was a child,
											and I let go, and then
I promised that I would call.
											I never did, though.
											Because I was afraid if I said
everything that she meant to me —
											that I owed perhaps the best parts

											I spent time in jails and brothels,

and law enforcement, NGO workers.
											And when I think about what we&#39;ve done
about human trafficking,
											I am hugely disappointed.
											Partly because we don&#39;t even talk
about the problem right at all.
											When I say &quot;human trafficking,&quot;
											most of you probably don&#39;t think
about someone like my auntie.
											You probably think
about a young girl or woman,

into prostitution by a violent pimp.

											As a journalist, I really care about how
we relate to each other through language,
											and the way we tell that story,
with all the gory, violent detail,
											the salacious aspects — I call that
&quot;look at her scars&quot; journalism.
											We use that story to convince ourselves
											that human trafficking is a bad man
doing a bad thing to an innocent girl.
											That story lets us off the hook.
											It takes away all the societal context
that we might be indicted for,
											for the structural inequality,
or the poverty,
											or the barriers to migration.
											We let ourselves think
											that human trafficking is only
about forced prostitution,
											when in reality,
											human trafficking is embedded

											Let me show you what I mean.
											Forced prostitution accounts for
22 percent of human trafficking.
											Ten percent is in state-
imposed forced labor.
											but a whopping 68 percent
is for the purpose of creating the goods
											and delivering the services
that most of us rely on every day,
											in sectors like agricultural work,
domestic work and construction.
											That is food and care and shelter.
											And somehow, these most essential workers
											are also among the world&#39;s most underpaid
and exploited today.
											Human trafficking is the use
of force, fraud or coercion
											to compel another person&#39;s labor.
											And it&#39;s found in cotton fields,
and coltan mines,
											and even car washes in Norway and England.
											It&#39;s found in U.S. military
bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.

											It&#39;s found in Thailand&#39;s fishing industry.
											That country has become the largest
exporter of shrimp in the world.
											But what are the circumstances
											behind all that cheap
and plentiful shrimp?
											Thai military were caught selling
Burmese and Cambodian migrants
											onto fishing boats.
											Those fishing boats were taken out,
the men put to work,
											and they were thrown overboard
if they made the mistake of falling sick,
											or trying to resist their treatment.
											Those fish were then used to feed shrimp,
											The shrimp were then sold
to four major global retailers:
											Costco, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour.

											Human trafficking is found
on a smaller scale than just that,
											and in places you would
never even imagine.

											The scheme in that case was incredible.
											The traffickers found young families
who were from Ghana and Togo,
											and they told these families that
&quot;your daughters are going to get
											a fine education in the United States.&quot;
											They then located winners
of the green card lottery,
											and they told them, &quot;We&#39;ll help you out.
											We&#39;ll get you a plane ticket.
We&#39;ll pay your fees.
											All you have to do is take
this young girl with you,

											Once everyone arrived in New Jersey,
the young girls were taken away,

											This is a huge problem.
											So what have we done about it?
											We&#39;ve mostly turned
to the criminal justice system.
											But keep in mind, most victims of human
trafficking are poor and marginalized.
											They&#39;re migrants, people of color.
											Sometimes they&#39;re in the sex trade.
											And for populations like these,
											the criminal justice system is
too often part of the problem,
											rather than the solution.
											In study after study, in countries ranging
from Bangladesh to the United States,
											between 20 and 60 percent of the people
in the sex trade who were surveyed
											said that they had been raped or assaulted
by the police in the past year alone.
											People in prostitution, including people
who have been trafficked into it,
											regularly receive multiple
convictions for prostitution.
											Having that criminal record makes it
so much more difficult
											to leave poverty, leave abuse,
or leave prostitution,
											if that person so desires.
											Workers outside of the sex sector —
											if they try and resist their treatment,
they risk deportation.
											In case after case I&#39;ve studied,
employers have no problem
											calling on law enforcement
to try and threaten or deport
											their striking trafficked workers.
											If those workers run away,
											they risk becoming part of the great mass
of undocumented workers
											who are also subject to the whims
of law enforcement if they&#39;re caught.

											Law enforcement is supposed to identify
victims and prosecute traffickers.

of human trafficking in the world,

fewer than 50,000 people.
											That&#39;s like comparing
											the population of the world
to the population of Los Angeles,
											proportionally speaking.
											As for convictions, out of an estimated
5,700 convictions in 2013,
											fewer than 500 were for labor trafficking.

											accounts for 68 percent
of all trafficking,

of the convictions.

											I&#39;ve heard one expert say that trafficking
happens where need meets greed.
											I&#39;d like to add one more element to that.
											Trafficking happens in sectors where
workers are excluded from protections,
											and denied the right to organize.
											Trafficking doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum.
											It happens in systematically
degraded work environments.

											I spent many months researching
a trafficking case called Global Horizons,
											involving hundreds of Thai farm workers.
											They were sent all over the States,
to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations,
											and Washington apple orchards,
and anywhere the work was needed.
											They were promised three years
of solid agricultural work.
											So they made a calculated risk.
											They sold their land, they sold
their wives&#39; jewelry,
											to make thousands in recruitment fees
for this company, Global Horizons.
											But once they were brought over,
											their passports were confiscated.
											Some of the men were beaten
and held at gunpoint.
											They worked so hard
they fainted in the fields.
											This case hit me so hard.

the Global Horizons survivors

I showed up to interview them.
											They finished one meal with this plate
of perfect, long-stemmed strawberries,
											and as they handed them to me, they said,
											&quot;Aren&#39;t these the kind of strawberries
you eat with somebody special
											in the States?
											And don&#39;t they taste so much better

											As I stood in that grocery store weeks
later, I realized I had no idea
											of who to thank for this plenty,
											and no idea of how
they were being treated.
											So, like the journalist I am, I started
digging into the agricultural sector.
											And I found there are too many fields,
and too few labor inspectors.
											I found multiple layers
of plausible deniability
											between grower and distributor
and processor, and God knows who else.
											The Global Horizons survivors had been
brought to the States
											on a temporary guest worker program.
											That guest worker program
ties a person&#39;s legal status
											to his or her employer,
											and denies that worker
the right to organize.
											Mind you, none of what I am describing
about this agricultural sector
											or the guest worker program
is actually human trafficking.
											It is merely what we find
legally tolerable.
											And I would argue this is
fertile ground for exploitation.
											And all of this had been hidden to me,

investing nearly 10 million dollars

as having the worst working conditions
											in that Global Horizons case.
											When he found out, he and his wife
were shocked and horrified,
											and they wound up writing
an op-ed for a newspaper,

											What would happen
if each one of us decided

to support companies
											if they don&#39;t eliminate exploitation
from their labor and supply chains?
											If we demanded laws calling for the same?
											If all the CEOs out there decided

											If we ended recruitment fees
for migrant workers?
											If we decided that guest workers
should have the right to organize
											without fear of retaliation?
											These would be decisions heard
around the world.
											This isn&#39;t a matter of buying
a fair-trade peach
											and calling it a day, buying
a guilt-free zone with your money.
											That&#39;s not how it works.
											This is the decision to change

first anti-trafficking organization
											actually headed and run
by trafficking survivors themselves.
											These Indian shipyard workers
were trafficked

reconstruction.
											They were threatened with deportation,
but they broke out of their work compound

to Washington, D.C.,

the National Guest Worker Alliance,

they have wound up helping other workers
											bring to light exploitation
and abuses in supply chains
											in Walmart and Hershey&#39;s factories.
											And although the Department
of Justice declined to take their case,
