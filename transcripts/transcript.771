											Today I want to talk to you
											about ethnic conflict
											and civil war.
											These are not normally the most cheerful of topics,
											nor do they generally generate
											the kind of good news
											that this conference is about.
											Yet, not only is there at least some good news
											to be told about fewer such conflicts now
											than two decades ago,
											but what is perhaps more important
											is that we also have come
											to a much better understanding of what can be done
											to further reduce the number
											of ethnic conflicts and civil wars
											and the suffering that they inflict.
											Three things stand out:
											leadership, diplomacy
											and institutional design.
											What I will focus on in my talk
											is why they matter, how they matter,
											and what we can all do
											to make sure that they continue to matter
											in the right ways,
											that is, how all of us can contribute
											to developing and honing the skills
											of local and global leaders
											to make peace
											and to make it last.
											But let&#39;s start at the beginning.

											Civil wars have made news headlines
											for many decades now,
											and ethnic conflicts in particular
											have been a near constant presence
											as a major international security threat.
											For nearly two decades now,
											the news has been bad
											and the images have been haunting.
											In Georgia, after years of stalemate,
											we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence
											in August, 2008.
											This quickly escalated into a five-day war
											between Russia and Georgia,
											leaving Georgia ever more divided.
											In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 —
											we just heard about them —
											quickly led to high levels
											of inter-ethnic violence
											and the killing and displacement
											of thousands of people.
											In Sri Lanka,
											a decades-long civil war
											between the Tamil minority
											and the Sinhala majority
											led to a bloody climax in 2009,
											after perhaps as many as 100,000
											people had been killed
											since 1983.
											In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks,
											unprecedented levels of violence occurred
											between ethnic Kyrgyz
											and ethnic Uzbeks.
											Hundreds have been killed,
											and more than 100,000 displaced,
											including many ethnic Uzbeks
											who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.
											In the Middle East,
											conflict between Israelis and Palestinians
											continues unabated,
											and it becomes ever more difficult
											to see how, just how
											a possible, sustainable solution
											can be achieved.
											Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines,
											but the killing and displacement there
											continues as well,
											and the sheer human misery that it creates
											is very hard to fathom.
											And in Iraq, finally,
											violence is on the rise again,
											and the country has yet to form a government
											four months after
											its last parliamentary elections.

											But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.
											So are these now the images of the past?
											Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures
											from the Middle East, Darfur,
											Iraq, elsewhere,
											there is a longer-term trend
											that does represent some good news.
											Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,
											there has been an overall decline
											in the number of civil wars.
											Since the high in the early 1990s,
											with about 50 such civil wars ongoing,
											we now have 30 percent fewer
											such conflicts today.
											The number of people killed in civil wars
											also is much lower today
											than it was a decade ago or two.
											But this trend is less unambiguous.
											The highest level of deaths on the battlefield
											was recorded between 1998 and 2001,
											with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels
											killed every year.
											The lowest number of combatant casualties
											occurred in 2003,
											with just 20,000 killed.
											Despite the up and down since then,
											the overall trend —
											and this is the important bit —
											clearly points downward
											for the past two decades.

									<p>
											The news about civilian casualties
											is also less bad than it used to be.
											From over 12,000 civilians
											deliberately killed in civil wars
											in 1997 and 1998,
											a decade later,
											this figure stands at 4,000.
											This is a decrease by two-thirds.
											This decline would be even more obvious
											if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda
											in 1994.
											But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered
											in a matter of just a few months.
											This certainly is an accomplishment
											that must never be surpassed.
											What is also important is to note
											that these figures only tell part of the story.
											They exclude people
											that died as a consequence of civil war,
											from hunger or disease, for example.
											And they also do not properly account
											for civilian suffering more generally.
											Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing
											have become highly effective,
											if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.
											To put it differently,
											for the civilians that suffer the consequences
											of ethnic conflict and civil war,
											there is no good war
											and there is no bad peace.
											Thus, even though every civilian killed,
											maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,
											the fact that the number
											of civilian casualties
											is clearly lower today
											than it was a decade ago,
											is good news.

											So, we have fewer conflicts today
											in which fewer people get killed.
											And the big question, of course,
											is why?
											In some cases,
											there is a military victory of one side.
											This is a solution of sorts,
											but rarely is it one
											that comes without human costs
											or humanitarian consequences.
											The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka
											is perhaps the most recent example of this,
											but we have seen similar
											so-called military solutions
											in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus
											and across most of Africa.
											At times, they are complimented
											by negotiated settlements,
											or at least cease-fire agreements,
											and peacekeepers are deployed.
											But hardly ever do they represent
											a resounding success —
											Bosnia and Herzegovina
											perhaps more so than Georgia.
											But for many parts of Africa,
											a colleague of mine once put it this way,
											&quot;The cease-fire on Tuesday night
											was reached just in time
											for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning.&quot;

											But let&#39;s look at the good news again.
											If there&#39;s no solution on the battlefield,
											three factors can account
											for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,
											or for sustainable peace afterwards:
											leadership, diplomacy
											and institutional design.
											Take the example of Northern Ireland.
											Despite centuries of animosity,
											decades of violence
											and thousands of people killed,
											1998 saw the conclusion
											of an historic agreement.
											Its initial version was skillfully mediated
											by Senator George Mitchell.
											Crucially, for the long-term success
											of the peace process in Northern Ireland,
											he imposed very clear conditions
											for the participation and negotiations.
											Central among them,
											a commitment
											to exclusively peaceful means.
											Subsequent revisions of the agreement
											were facilitated by the British and Irish governments,
											who never wavered in their determination
											to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.

									<p>
											The core institutions
											that were put in place in 1998
											and their modifications
											in 2006 and 2008
											were highly innovative
											and allowed all conflict parties
											to see their core concerns and demands addressed.
											The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement
											in Northern Ireland
											with cross-border institutions
											that link Belfast and Dublin
											and thus recognizes
											the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.
											And significantly,
											there&#39;s also a clear focus
											on both the rights of individuals
											and the rights of communities.
											The provisions in the agreement may be complex,
											but so is the underlying conflict.
											Perhaps most importantly,
											local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,
											not always fast
											and not always enthusiastically,
											but rise in the end they did.
											Who ever could have imagined
											Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness
											jointly governing Northern Ireland
											as First and Deputy First Minister?

									<p>
											But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example,
											or does this kind of explanation
											only hold more generally
											in democratic and developed countries?
											By no means.
											The ending of Liberia&#39;s long-lasting civil war
											in 2003
											illustrates the importance
											of leadership, diplomacy
											and institutional design
											as much as the successful prevention
											of a full-scale civil war
											in Macedonia in 2001,
											or the successful ending
											of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.
											In all three cases,
											local leaders were willing and able
											to make peace,
											the international community stood ready
											to help them negotiate and implement an agreement,
											and the institutions have lived up
											to the promise that they held
											on the day they were agreed.

											Focusing on leadership, diplomacy
											and institutional design
											also helps explain failures to achieve peace,
											or to make it last.
											The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords
											did not lead to an end
											of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
											Not all the issues that needed to be resolved
											were actually covered in the agreements.
											Rather, local leaders committed
											to revisiting them later on.
											Yet instead of grasping this opportunity,
											local and international leaders
											soon disengaged
											and became distracted
											by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11
											and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

											The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan
											signed in 2005
											turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,
											and its provisions may yet bear the seeds
											of a full-scale return to war
											between north and south.
											Changes and shortcomings in leadership,
											more off than on international diplomacy
											and institutional failures
											account for this
											in almost equal measure.
											Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,
											the ongoing conflict in Darfur,
											escalating tribal violence in the south
											and generally weak state capacity
											across all of Sudan
											complete a very depressing picture
											of the state of affairs
											in Africa&#39;s largest country.

									<p>
											A final example: Kosovo.
											The failure to achieve
											a negotiated solution for Kosovo
											and the violence, tension
											and de facto partition that resulted from it
											have their reasons
											in many, many different factors.
											Central among them are three.
											First, the intransigence of local leaders
											to settle for nothing less
											than their maximum demands.
											Second, an international diplomatic effort
											that was hampered from the beginning
											by Western support for Kosovo&#39;s independence.
											And third, a lack of imagination
											when it came to designing institutions
											that could have addressed the concerns
											of Serbs and Albanians alike.
											By the same token —
											and here we have some good news again —
											the very fact that there is a high-level,
											well-resourced international presence
											in Kosovo
											and the Balkans region more generally
											and the fact that local leaders on both sides
											have showed relative restraint,
											explains why things have not been worse
											over the past two years since 2008.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So even in situations
											where outcomes are less than optimal,
											local leaders
											and international leaders have a choice,
											and they can make a difference for the better.
											A cold war
											is not as good
											as a cold peace,
											but a cold peace
											is still better than a hot war.
											Good news is also about learning the right lesson.
											So what then distinguishes
											the Israeli/Palestinian conflict
											from that in Northern Ireland,
											or the civil war in Sudan
											from that in Liberia?
											Both successes and failures
											teach us several critically important things
											that we need to bear in mind
											if we want the good news to continue.
											First, leadership.
											In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war
											are not natural
											but man-made disasters,
											their prevention and settlement
											does not happen automatically either.
											Leadership needs to be capable,
											determined and visionary
											in its commitment to peace.
											Leaders need to connect to each other
											and to their followers,
											and they need to bring them along
											on what is an often arduous journey
											into a peaceful future.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Second, diplomacy.
											Diplomacy needs to be well resourced,
											sustained,
											and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures
											on leaders and followers.
											It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,
											and it needs to ensure
											that a broad coalition
											of local, regional
											and international supporters
											help them implement their agreement.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Third, institutional design.
											Institutional design requires
											a keen focus on issues,
											innovative thinking
											and flexible and well-funded implementation.
											Conflict parties need to move away
											from maximum demands
											and towards a compromise
											that recognizes each other&#39;s needs.
											And they need to think
											about the substance of their agreement
											much more than about
											the labels they want to attach to them.
											Conflict parties also need to be prepared
											to return to the negotiation table
											if the agreement implementation stalls.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											For me personally,
											the most critical lesson of all is this:
											Local commitment to peace
											is all-important,
											but it is often not enough
											to prevent or end violence.
											Yet, no amount of diplomacy
											or institutional design
											can make up for local failures
											and the consequences that they have.
											Therefore, we must invest
											in developing leaders,
											leaders that have the skills,
											vision and determination
											to make peace.
											Leaders, in other words,
											that people will trust
											and that they will want to follow
											even if that means
											making hard choices.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											A final thought:
											Ending civil wars
											is a process that is fraught with dangers,
											frustrations and setbacks.
											It often takes a generation to accomplish,
											but it also requires us, today&#39;s generation,
											to take responsibility
											and to learn the right lessons
											about leadership, diplomacy
											and institutional design,
											so that the child soldiers of today
											can become the children of tomorrow.

institutional design of solutions for self-determination conflicts, and ethnopolitics and minority questions. Bridging the divide between academia and policy-making, <strong>he has been involved in various phases of conflict settlement processes</strong> in Sudan, Moldova, Sri Lanka and Kosovo. He has also worked on a wide range of conflicts in places such as Northern Ireland, the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and Asia. He is currently advising on the settlement of the status of Kirkuk, Iraq, and Transnistria, Moldova. He&#39;s written a dozen books, including Ethnic Conflict: A Global Perspective, the first major treatment of the subject aimed at a broad general audience. He&#39;s the founding editor of Ethnopolitics, a quarterly, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of ethnic conflicts and their management around the globe.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Stefan Wolff","tags":["Africa","iraq","peace","violence","war"],"title":"The path to ending ethnic conflicts","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":318732}]}
