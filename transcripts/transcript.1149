											I got my start
											in writing and research
											as a surgical trainee,
											as someone who was a long ways away
											from becoming any kind of an expert at anything.
											So the natural question you ask then at that point
											is, how do I get good at what I&#39;m trying to do?
											And it became a question of,
											how do we all get good
											at what we&#39;re trying to do?

											It&#39;s hard enough to learn to get the skills,

											I had to think about how I sew and how I cut,
											but then also how I pick the right person
											to come to an operating room.
											And then in the midst of all this
											came this new context
											for thinking about what it meant to be good.

											In the last few years
											we realized we were in the deepest crisis
											of medicine&#39;s existence
											due to something you don&#39;t normally think about
											when you&#39;re a doctor
											concerned with how you do good for people,
											which is the cost
											of health care.
											There&#39;s not a country in the world
											that now is not asking
											whether we can afford what doctors do.
											The political fight that we&#39;ve developed
											has become one around
											whether it&#39;s the government that&#39;s the problem
											or is it insurance companies that are the problem.
											And the answer is yes and no;
											it&#39;s deeper than all of that.

											The cause of our troubles
											is actually the complexity that science has given us.
											And in order to understand this,
											I&#39;m going to take you back a couple of generations.
											I want to take you back
											to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, &quot;The Youngest Science.&quot;
											Lewis Thomas was a physician-writer,
											one of my favorite writers.
											And he wrote this book to explain, among other things,
											what it was like to be a medical intern
											at the Boston City Hospital
											in the pre-penicillin year
											of 1937.
											It was a time when medicine was cheap
											and very ineffective.
											If you were in a hospital, he said,
											it was going to do you good
											only because it offered you
											some warmth, some food, shelter,
											and maybe the caring attention
											of a nurse.
											Doctors and medicine
											made no difference at all.
											That didn&#39;t seem to prevent the doctors
											from being frantically busy in their days,
											as he explained.

											What they were trying to do
											was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses
											for which they could do something.
											And there were a few.
											You might have a lobar pneumonia, for example,
											and they could give you an antiserum,
											an injection of rabid antibodies
											to the bacterium streptococcus,
											if the intern sub-typed it correctly.
											If you had an acute congestive heart failure,
											they could bleed a pint of blood from you
											by opening up an arm vein,
											giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis
											and then giving you oxygen by tent.
											If you had early signs of paralysis
											and you were really good at asking personal questions,
											you might figure out
											that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis,
											in which case you could give this nice concoction
											of mercury and arsenic —
											as long as you didn&#39;t overdose them and kill them.
											Beyond these sorts of things,
											a medical doctor didn&#39;t have a lot that they could do.

											This was when the core structure of medicine
											was created —
											what it meant to be good at what we did
											and how we wanted to build medicine to be.
											It was at a time
											when what was known you could know,
											you could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.
											If you had a prescription pad,
											if you had a nurse,
											if you had a hospital
											that would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools,
											you really could do it all.
											You set the fracture, you drew the blood,
											you spun the blood,
											looked at it under the microscope,
											you plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.
											This was a life as a craftsman.

											As a result, we built it around
											a culture and set of values
											that said what you were good at
											was being daring,
											at being courageous,
											at being independent and self-sufficient.
											Autonomy was our highest value.
											Go a couple generations forward

											We can&#39;t guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.

											There was a study where they looked
											at how many clinicians it took to take care of you
											if you came into a hospital,

											And in the year 1970,

											and then just a little bit of time for a doctor
											who more or less checked in on you

											But I think we&#39;re ignoring certain facts
											that tell us something about what we can do.
											As we&#39;ve looked at the data
											about the results that have come
											as the complexity has increased,
											we found
											that the most expensive care
											is not necessarily the best care.
											And vice versa,
											the best care
											often turns out to be the least expensive —
											has fewer complications,
											the people get more efficient at what they do.
											And what that means
											is there&#39;s hope.
											Because [if] to have the best results,
											you really needed the most expensive care
											in the country, or in the world,

											But when we look at the positive deviants —

											That is to say, they found ways
											to get all of the different pieces,
											all of the different components,
											to come together into a whole.
											Having great components is not enough,
											and yet we&#39;ve been obsessed in medicine with components.
											We want the best drugs, the best technologies,

											There&#39;s a famous thought experiment

											One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
											and he got interested in the question of,
											well how many CT scans did they do
											for their community in Cedar Rapids?
											He got interested in this
											because there had been government reports,
											newspaper reports, journal articles
											saying that there had been too many CT scans done.
											He didn&#39;t see it in his own patients.
											And so he asked the question, &quot;How many did we do?&quot;
											and he wanted to get the data.
											It took him three months.
											No one had asked this question in his community before.
											And what he found was that,
											for the 300,000 people in their community,
											in the previous year
											they had done 52,000 CT scans.
											They had found a problem.

											Which brings us to skill number two a system has.
											Skill one, find where your failures are.
											Skill two is devise solutions.
											I got interested in this
											when the World Health Organization came to my team
											asking if we could help with a project
											to reduce deaths in surgery.
											The volume of surgery had spread
											around the world,
											but the safety of surgery
											had not.
											Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these
											are to do more training,
											give people more specialization
											or bring in more technology.

											Well in surgery, you couldn&#39;t have people who are more specialized
											and you couldn&#39;t have people who are better trained.
											And yet we see unconscionable levels
											of death, disability
											that could be avoided.
											And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.
											We looked at skyscraper construction,
											we looked at the aviation world,
											and we found
											that they have technology, they have training,
											and then they have one other thing:
											They have checklists.
											I did not expect
											to be spending a significant part
											of my time as a Harvard surgeon
											worrying about checklists.
											And yet, what we found
											were that these were tools
											to help make experts better.
											We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Could we design a checklist for surgery?
											Not for the lowest people on the totem pole,
											but for the folks
											who were all the way around the chain,
											the entire team including the surgeons.
											And what they taught us
											was that designing a checklist
											to help people handle complexity
											actually involves more difficulty than I had understood.
											You have to think about things
											like pause points.
											You need to identify the moments in a process
											when you can actually catch a problem before it&#39;s a danger
											and do something about it.
											You have to identify
											that this is a before-takeoff checklist.
											And then you need to focus on the killer items.
											An aviation checklist,
											like this one for a single-engine plane,
											isn&#39;t a recipe for how to fly a plane,
											it&#39;s a reminder of the key things
											that get forgotten or missed
											if they&#39;re not checked.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we did this.
											We created a 19-item two-minute checklist
											for surgical teams.
											We had the pause points
											immediately before anesthesia is given,
											immediately before the knife hits the skin,
											immediately before the patient leaves the room.
											And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there —
											making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame
											because that cuts the infection rate by half —
											and then interesting stuff,
											because you can&#39;t make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.
											Instead, you can make a recipe
											for how to have a team that&#39;s prepared for the unexpected.
											And we had items like making sure everyone in the room
											had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day,
											because you get half a dozen people or more
											who are sometimes coming together as a team
											for the very first time that day that you&#39;re coming in.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We implemented this checklist
											in eight hospitals around the world,
											deliberately in places from rural Tanzania
											to the University of Washington in Seattle.
											We found that after they adopted it
											the complication rates fell
											35 percent.
											It fell in every hospital it went into.
											The death rates fell
											47 percent.
											This was bigger than a drug.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And that brings us
											to skill number three,
											the ability to implement this,
											to get colleagues across the entire chain
											to actually do these things.
											And it&#39;s been slow to spread.
											This is not yet our norm in surgery —
											let alone making checklists
											to go onto childbirth and other areas.
											There&#39;s a deep resistance
											because using these tools
											forces us to confront
											that we&#39;re not a system,
											forces us to behave with a different set of values.
											Just using a checklist
											requires you to embrace different values from the ones we&#39;ve had,
											like humility,
											discipline,
											teamwork.
											This is the opposite of what we were built on:
											independence, self-sufficiency,
											autonomy.

											I met an actual cowboy, by the way.
											I asked him, what was it like
											to actually herd a thousand cattle
											across hundreds of miles?
											How did you do that?
											And he said, &quot;We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around.&quot;
											They communicate electronically constantly,
											and they have protocols and checklists
											for how they handle everything —
											(Laughter)
											— from bad weather
											to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.
											Even the cowboys are pit crews now.

											making a pathway out of poverty,
											is the great task of our generation as a whole.
											In every field, knowledge has exploded,
