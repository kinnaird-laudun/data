											America&#39;s public energy conversation
											boils down to this question:
											Would you rather die of A) oil wars,
											or B) climate change,
											or C) nuclear holocaust,
											or D) all of the above?
											Oh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?
											That&#39;s the one we&#39;re not normally offered.
											What if we could make energy do our work
											without working our undoing?
											Could we have fuel without fear?
											Could we reinvent fire?

											Four-fifths of the world&#39;s energy
											still comes from burning each year
											four cubic miles of the rotted remains
											of primeval swamp goo.
											Those fossil fuels
											have built our civilization.
											They&#39;ve created our wealth.
											They&#39;ve enriched the lives of billions.
											But they also have rising costs
											to our security, economy, health and environment
											that are starting to erode, if not outweigh their benefits.

									<p>
											So we need a new fire.
											And switching from the old fire to the new fire
											means changing two big stories about oil and electricity,
											each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air.
											But they&#39;re really quite distinct.

											Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil —
											although almost half is made from coal.
											Their uses are quite concentrated.
											Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.
											Three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings.
											And the rest of both runs factories.
											So very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories
											save oil and coal,
											and also natural gas that can displace both of them.

											But today&#39;s energy system is not just inefficient,
											it is also disconnected,
											aging, dirty and insecure.
											So it needs refurbishment.
											By 2050 though, it could become efficient,
											connected and distributed

											autos, factories and buildings
											all relying on a modern, secure

											We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050
											and use one-third less natural gas
											while switching to efficient use
											and renewable supply.
											This could cost, by 2050,
											five trillion dollars less in net present value,
											that is expressed as a lump sum today,
											than business as usual —
											assuming that carbon emissions
											and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero —
											a conservatively low estimate.
											Yet this cheaper energy system
											could support 158 percent bigger U.S. economy
											all without needing oil or coal,
											or for that matter nuclear energy.
											Moreover, this transition needs no new inventions
											and no acts of Congress
											and no new federal taxes, mandate subsidies or laws

											Let me say that again.
											I&#39;m going to tell you how to get the United States
											completely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaper
											with no act of Congress
											led by business for profit.
											In other words, we&#39;re going to use our most effective institutions —
											private enterprise co-evolving with civil society
											and sped by military innovation
											to go around our least effective institutions.
											And whether you care most
											about profits and jobs and competitive advantage
											or national security, or environmental stewardship

											General Eisenhower reputedly said
											that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem
											makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies.
											So in reinventing fire,
											we integrated all four sectors that use energy —
											transportation, buildings, industry and electricity —
											and we integrated four kinds of innovation,
											not just technology and policy,

											And the results may at first seem incredible,
											but as Marshall McLuhan said,
											&quot;Only puny secrets need protection.
											Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity.&quot;
											Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions,
											both driven by modern efficiency,
											and you get the really big story: reinventing fire,
											where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets
											can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050,
											saving 5 trillion dollars,
											growing the economy 2.6-fold,
											strengthening out national security,
											oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal,
											reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.

											Now if you like any of those outcomes,
											you can support reinventing fire
											without needing to like all of them
											and without needing to agree about which of them is most important.
											So focusing on outcomes, not motives,
											can turn gridlock and conflict
											into a unifying solution to America&#39;s energy challenge.
											This also turns out to be the best way
											to cope with global challenges —
											climate change, nuclear proliferation,
											energy insecurity, energy poverty —
											all of which make us less safe.

											Now our team at RMI helps smart companies
											to get unstuck and speed this journey
											via six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching.
											Of course there&#39;s still a lot of old thinking out there too.
											Former oil man Maurice Strong said,
											&quot;Not all the fossils are in the fuel.&quot;
											But as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us,
											&quot;Companies hampered by old thinking won&#39;t be a problem
											because,&quot; he said,&quot; they simply won&#39;t be around long-term.&quot;

											I&#39;ve described not just a once-in-a-civilization
											business opportunity,
											but one of the most profound transitions
											in the history of our species.
											We humans are inventing a new fire,
											not dug from below,
											but flowing from above;
											not scarce, but bountiful;
											not local, but everywhere;
											not transient, but permanent;
											not costly, but free.
											And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas
											and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure,
											this new fire is flameless.
											Efficiently used, it really can do our work
											without working our undoing.

											Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize.
											And our new book &quot;Reinventing Fire&quot;
											describes how you can capture it.
											So with the conversation just begun

											let me invite you each

											to help make the world richer, fairer,
											cooler and safer
											by together reinventing fire.

Since studying at Harvard and Oxford in the 1960s, he&#39;s written dozens of books, and initiated ambitious projects -- cofounding the influential, environment-focused <a href=\"http://www.rmi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Rocky Mountain Institute</a>; prototyping the ultra-efficient Hypercar -- to <strong>focus the world&#39;s attention on alternative approaches to energy</strong> and transportation. </p><p>His critical thinking has driven people around the globe -- from world leaders to the average Joe -- to <strong>think differently about energy and its role in some of our biggest problems</strong>: climate change, oil dependency, national security, economic health, and depletion of natural resources. </p><p>Lovins offers solutions as well. His new book and site, <a href=\"http://www.rmi.org/ReinventingFire\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reinventing Fire</em></a>, offers actionable solutions for four energy-intensive sectors of the  economy: transportation, buildings, industry and electricity. Lovins has always focused on solutions that conserve natural resources while also promoting economic growth; Texas Instruments and Wal-Mart are just two of the mega-corporations he has advised on improving energy efficiency. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Amory Lovins","tags":["alternative energy","energy","science","solar energy","technology","wind energy","engineering","climate change","invention","innovation","design","economics","business","green","future","materials","industrial design","environment","sustainability","natural resources","electricity"],"title":"A 40-year plan for energy","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1193050}]}
