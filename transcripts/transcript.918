									<p>
											A couple of years ago,
											when I was attending
the TED conference in Long Beach,
											I met Harriet.
											We&#39;d actually met online before —
not the way you&#39;re thinking.
											We were introduced
because we both knew Linda Avey,
											one of the founders of the first
online personal genomic companies.
											And because we shared
our genetic information with Linda,
											she could see that Harriet and I shared
											a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA,
haplotype K1a1b1a,
											which meant we were distantly related.
											We actually share the same
genealogy with Ötzi the Iceman.
											So — Ötzi, Harriet and me.
											And being the current day, of course,
we started our own Facebook group.
											You&#39;re all welcome to join.
											When I met Harriet in person
the next year at the TED conference,
											she&#39;d gone online and ordered
our own happy haplotype T-shirts.

											Why am I telling you this story?
											What does it have to do
with the future of health?
											Well, the way I met Harriet is an example
											of how leveraging cross-disciplinary,
exponentially growing technologies
											is affecting our future
of health and wellness —
											from low-cost gene analysis
											to the ability to do
powerful bioinformatics
											to the connection of the Internet
and social networking.
											What I&#39;d like to talk about today
											is understanding
these exponential technologies.
											We often think linearly.
											But if you think about it,
if you have a lily pad
											and it just divided every single day —
											two, four, eight, sixteen —
in 15 days, you&#39;d have 32,000.
											What do you think you&#39;d have in a month?
											We&#39;re at a billion.
											If we start to think exponentially,
											we can see how this is starting to affect
all the technologies around us.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Many of these technologies,
speaking as a physician and innovator,
											we can start to leverage,
to impact the future of our own health
											and of health care,
											and to address many of the major
challenges in health care today,
											ranging from the exponential costs
to the aging population,
											the way we really don&#39;t use
information very well today,
											the fragmentation of care
											and the often very difficult course
of adoption of innovation.
											And one of the major things we can do
is move the curve to the left.
											We spend most of our money
on the last 20 percent of life.
											What if we could incentivize physicians
in the health care system
											and our own selves
											to move the curve to the left
and improve our health,
											leveraging technology as well?
											Now my favorite example
of exponential technology,
											we all have in our pocket.
											If you think about it,
these are really dramatically improving.
											I mean, this is the iPhone 4.
											Imagine what the iPhone 8
will be able to do.

									<p>
											Now, I&#39;ve gained some insight into this.
											I&#39;ve been the track share
for the medicine portion
											of a new institution
called Singularity University,
											based in Silicon Valley.
											We bring together each summer
about 100 very talented students
											from around the world.
											And we look at these exponential
technologies from medicine,
											biotech, artificial intelligence,
robotics, nanotechnology, space,
											and address how we can cross-train
and leverage these
											to impact major unmet goals.
											We also have seven-day executive programs.
											And coming up next month is FutureMed,
											a program to help cross-train
and leverage technologies into medicine.

									<p>
											Now, I mentioned the phone.
											These mobile phones have over 20,000
different mobile apps available.
											There&#39;s one out of the UK
where you can pee on a little chip,
											connect it to your iPhone,
											and check for an STD.
											I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d try that,
but it&#39;s available.
											There are other sorts of applications.
											Merging your phone
and diagnostics, for example,
											measuring your blood glucose
on your iPhone
											and sending that to your physician,
											so they can better understand
and you can better understand
											your blood sugars as a diabetic.
											So let&#39;s see how exponential
technologies are taking health care.
											Let&#39;s start with faster.
											It&#39;s no secret that computers,
through Moore&#39;s law,
											are speeding up faster and faster.

											We can do more powerful things with them.
											They&#39;re really approaching —
in many cases, surpassing —
											the ability of the human mind.
											But where I think computational speed
is most applicable is in imaging.
											The ability now to look
inside the body in real time
											with very high resolution
											is really becoming incredible.
											And we&#39;re layering multiple
technologies — PET scans, CT scans
											and molecular diagnostics —
											to find and seek things
at different levels.
											Here you&#39;re going to see the very highest
resolution MRI scan done today,
											of Marc Hodosh, the curator of TEDMED.
											And now we can see inside of the brain
											at a resolution and ability
never before available,
											and essentially learn how to reconstruct

											or backwards engineer the brain,

pathology, disease and therapy.
											We can look inside with real-time
fMRI in the brain at real time.
											And by understanding these sorts
of processes and these connections,
											we&#39;re going to understand the effects
of medication or meditation
											and better personalize
and make effective, for example,
											psychoactive drugs.

											The scanners for these are getting
smaller, less expensive

											And this sort of data explosion
available from these
											is really almost becoming a challenge.
											The scan of today takes up
about 800 books, or 20 gigabytes.
											The scan in a couple of years
will be one terabyte, or 800,000 books.
											How do you leverage that information?
											Let&#39;s get personal.
											I won&#39;t ask who here&#39;s had a colonoscopy,
but if you&#39;re over age 50,
											it&#39;s time for your screening colonoscopy.
											How&#39;d you like to avoid
the pointy end of the stick?
											Now there&#39;s essentially
virtual colonoscopy.
											Compare those two pictures.
											As a radiologist, you can basically
fly through your patient&#39;s colon,
											and augmenting that
with artificial intelligence,
											potentially identify a lesion
that we might have missed,
											but using AI on top of radiology,
											we can find lesions
that were missed before.
											Maybe this will encourage
people to get colonoscopies
											that wouldn&#39;t have otherwise.

											This is an example of this paradigm shift.
											We&#39;re moving to this integration
of biomedicine, information technology,
											wireless and, I would say, mobile now —
this era of digital medicine.
											Even my stethoscope is now digital,
and of course, there&#39;s an app for that.
											We&#39;re moving, obviously,
to the era of the tricorder.
											So the handheld ultrasound
is basically surpassing
											and supplanting the stethoscope.
											These are now at a price point
of what used to be 100,000 euros
											or a couple hundred-thousand dollars.
											For about 5,000 dollars,
											I can have the power of a very powerful
diagnostic device in my hand.

to merging medical data,

											I can access my patients&#39; data
from wherever I am,

											And now, of course, we&#39;re in the era
of the iPad, even the iPad 2.
											Just last month,
											the first FDA-approved

reading on these sorts of devices.
											So certainly, the physicians
of today, including myself,

when, in a couple of years,

this cloud-based information,
											when we really have the AI physician
and leverage our brains to connectivity
											to make decisions and diagnostics
at a level never done.
											Already today, you don&#39;t need to go
to your physician in many cases.
											Only in about 20 percent of visits
do you need to lay hands on the patient.

											My friend Jessica sent me
a picture of her head laceration,

											Now, we&#39;ve heard a lot today
about technology and connection.
											And I think some of these technologies
											will enable us to be more connected
with our patients, to take more time
											and do the important
human-touch elements of medicine,
											as augmented by these technologies.
											Now, we&#39;ve talked about
augmenting the patient.
											How about augmenting the physician?
											We&#39;re now in the era
of super-enabling the surgeon,
											who can now go into the body and do
robotic surgery, which is here today,
											at a level that was not really possible
even five years ago.
											And now this is being augmented
with further layers of technology,
											like augmented reality.
											So the surgeon can see
inside the patient, through their lens,
											where the tumor is,
where the blood vessels are.
											This can be integrated
with decision support.
											A surgeon in New York can help
a surgeon in Amsterdam, for example.
											And we&#39;re entering an era
of truly scarless surgery called NOTES,
											where the robotic endoscope
can come out the stomach
											and pull out that gallbladder,
											all in a scarless way and robotically.
											This is called NOTES, and it&#39;s coming —
basically scarless surgery,
											as mediated by robotic surgery.

											Now, how about controlling other elements?
											For those who have
disabilities — the paraplegic,

interface, or BCI,
											where chips have been put
on the motor cortex
											of completely quadriplegic patients,
											and they can control
a cursor or a wheelchair
											or, potentially, a robotic arm.
											These devices are getting smaller
											and going into more and more
of these patients.
											Still in clinical trials,
											but imagine when we can connect
these, for example,
											to the amazing bionic limb,
											such as the DEKA Arm,
built by Dean Kamen and colleagues,
											which has 17 degrees
of motion and freedom,
											and can allow the person who&#39;s lost a limb
											to have much higher dexterity or control
than they&#39;ve had in the past.

of wearable robotics, actually.
											If you haven&#39;t lost a limb
but had a stroke,
											you can wear these augmented limbs.

the folks at Berkeley Bionics —
											they&#39;ve developed eLEGS.
											I took this video last week.
											Here&#39;s a paraplegic patient, walking
by strapping on these exoskeletons.

wheelchair-bound.
											This is the early era
of wearable robotics.
											And by leveraging
these sorts of technologies,
											we&#39;re going to change
the definition of disability
											to, in some cases, be superability,
or super-enabling.
											This is Aimee Mullins, who lost
her lower limbs as a young child,
											and Hugh Herr, who&#39;s a professor at MIT,
											who lost his limbs in a climbing accident.
											And now both of them can climb better,
move faster, swim differently

											But often it&#39;s too late,

											I think we&#39;ll enter a new era
that I like to call stage 0 medicine.
											And as a cancer doctor,
I&#39;m looking forward to being out of a job.
