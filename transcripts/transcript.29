											When you have 21 minutes to speak,
											two million years seems
like a really long time.
											But evolutionarily,
two million years is nothing.
											And yet in two million years,
											the human brain
has nearly tripled in mass,
											going from the one-and-a-quarter pound
brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,
											to the almost three-pound meatloaf
											that everybody here
has between their ears.
											What is it about a big brain
											that nature was so eager
for every one of us to have one?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, it turns out when
brains triple in size,
											they don&#39;t just get three times bigger;
they gain new structures.
											And one of the main reasons our brain got
so big is because it got a new part,
											called the &quot;frontal lobe.&quot;
											Particularly, a part called
the &quot;pre-frontal cortex.&quot;
											What does a pre-frontal cortex
do for you that should justify
											the entire architectural overhaul
of the human skull
											in the blink of evolutionary time?
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											It turns out the pre-frontal
cortex does lots of things,
											but one of the most important things
it does is an experience simulator.
											Pilots practice in flight simulators
											so that they don&#39;t make
real mistakes in planes.
											Human beings have this
marvelous adaptation
											that they can actually have
experiences in their heads
											before they try them out in real life.
											This is a trick that none
of our ancestors could do,
											and that no other animal
can do quite like we can.
											It&#39;s a marvelous adaptation.
											It&#39;s up there with opposable thumbs
and standing upright and language
											as one of the things that got
our species out of the trees
											and into the shopping mall.

some extra prints in the closet.
											We&#39;re going to give you
one as your prize to take home.
											We happen to have number three
and number four,&quot; we tell the subject.
											This is a bit of a difficult choice,

strongly to the other,
											but naturally, people
tend to pick number three
											because they liked it
a little better than number four.

											Here&#39;s an experiment we did at Harvard.
											We created a black-and-white
photography course,
											and we allowed students to come in
and learn how to use a darkroom.
											So we gave them cameras;
they went around campus;
											they took 12 pictures
of their favorite professors
											and their dorm room and their dog,
											and all the other things they wanted
to have Harvard memories of.
											They bring us the camera;
we make up a contact sheet;
											they figure out which are
the two best pictures;
											and we now spend six hours
teaching them about darkrooms.
											And they blow two of them up,
											and they have two gorgeous
eight-by-10 glossies
											of meaningful things to them, and we say,
											&quot;Which one would you like to give up?&quot;
											&quot;I have to give one up?&quot;
											&quot;Yes, we need one as evidence
of the class project.
											So you have to give me one.
You have to make a choice.
											You get to keep one,
and I get to keep one.&quot;

											Now, there are two conditions
in this experiment.
											In one case, the students are told,
											&quot;But you know,
if you want to change your mind,
											I&#39;ll always have the other one here,
											and in the next four days, before
I actually mail it to headquarters&quot; —
											Yeah, &quot;headquarters&quot; —
											&quot;I&#39;ll be glad to swap it out with you.
											In fact, I&#39;ll come to your dorm room,
just give me an email.
											Better yet, I&#39;ll check with you.
											You ever want to change your mind,
it&#39;s totally returnable.&quot;
											The other half of the students
are told exactly the opposite:
											&quot;Make your choice, and by the way,
											the mail is going out, gosh,
in two minutes, to England.
											Your picture will be winging
its way over the Atlantic.
											You will never see it again.&quot;
											Half of the students
in each of these conditions
											are asked to make predictions
											about how much they&#39;re going to come
to like the picture that they keep
											and the picture they leave behind.
											Other students are just sent back
to their little dorm rooms
											and they are measured
over the next three to six days
											on their liking, satisfaction
with the pictures.
											And look at what we find.

											First of all, here&#39;s what students
think is going to happen.
											They think they&#39;re going to maybe
come to like the picture they chose
											a little more
than the one they left behind,
											but these are not statistically
significant differences.
											It&#39;s a very small increase,
and it doesn&#39;t much matter
											whether they were in the reversible
or irreversible condition.

											Wrong-o. Bad simulators. Because
here&#39;s what&#39;s really happening.
											Both right before the swap
and five days later,
											people who are stuck with that picture,
											who have no choice,
											who can never change their mind,
											like it a lot!
											And people who are deliberating
— &quot;Should I return it?
											Have I gotten the right one?
Maybe this isn&#39;t the good one?
											Maybe I left the good one?&quot; —
have killed themselves.
											They don&#39;t like their picture,
											and in fact even after the opportunity
to swap has expired,
											they still don&#39;t like their picture.
											Why?
											Because the [reversible] condition
is not conducive
											to the synthesis of happiness.

											So here&#39;s the final piece
of this experiment.
											We bring in a whole new group
of naive Harvard students
											and we say, &quot;You know,
we&#39;re doing a photography course,
											and we can do it one of two ways.
											We could do it so that when
you take the two pictures,
											you&#39;d have four days to change your mind,
											or we&#39;re doing another course
where you take the two pictures
											and you make up your mind right away
and you can never change it.
											Which course would you like
to be in?&quot; Duh!
											66 percent of the students, two-thirds,
											prefer to be in the course where they have
the opportunity to change their mind.
											Hello? 66 percent of the students
choose to be in the course
											in which they will ultimately be deeply
dissatisfied with the picture.
											Because they do not know the conditions
under which synthetic happiness grows.

											The Bard said everything best,
of course, and he&#39;s making my point here
											but he&#39;s making it hyperbolically:
											&quot;&#39;Tis nothing good or bad /
But thinking makes it so.&quot;
											It&#39;s nice poetry,

											In more turgid prose,
but closer to the truth,
											was the father of modern capitalism,
Adam Smith, and he said this.
											This is worth contemplating:
											&quot;The great source of both the misery
and disorders of human life
											seems to arise from overrating
the difference
											between one permanent
situation and another —
											Some of these situations may, no doubt,
deserve to be preferred to others,
											but none of them can deserve to be pursued
											with that passionate ardor
which drives us to violate the rules
											either of prudence or of justice,
											or to corrupt the future
tranquility of our minds,
											either by shame from the remembrance
of our own folly,
											or by remorse for the horror
of our own injustice.&quot;
											In other words: yes, some things
are better than others.

											We should have preferences that lead us
into one future over another.
											But when those preferences
drive us too hard and too fast
											because we have overrated
the difference between these futures,
											we are at risk.
											When our ambition is bounded,
it leads us to work joyfully.
											When our ambition is unbounded,
											it leads us to lie, to cheat,
to steal, to hurt others,
											to sacrifice things of real value.
											When our fears are bounded,
											we&#39;re prudent, we&#39;re cautious,
											we&#39;re thoughtful.
											When our fears
are unbounded and overblown,
											we&#39;re reckless, and we&#39;re cowardly.

you with, from these data,

But underneath the goofball brilliance, [he] has a serious argument to make about why human beings are forever wrongly predicting what will make them happy.","whotheyare":"Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong -- a premise he supports with intriguing research, and explains in his accessible and unexpectedly funny book, <em>Stumbling on Happiness.</em>","whylisten":"<p>Dan Gilbert believes that, in our ardent, lifelong pursuit of happiness, most of us have the wrong map. In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>. The immensely readable <em><a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\" target=\"_blank\">Stumbling on Happiness</a>,</em> published in 2006, became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<br /><br />In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life. At 19, he was a high school dropout with dreams of writing science fiction. When a creative writing class at his community college was full, he enrolled in the only available course: psychology. He found his passion there, earned a doctorate in social psychology in 1985 at Princeton, and has since won a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching prize for his work at Harvard.

First, most of us would expect lottery winners to be much happier than controls, and they weren’t. Second, most of us would expect paraplegics to be wildly less happy than either controls or lottery winners, and in fact they were only slightly less happy (though it is admittedly difficult to interpret numerical differences on rating scales like the ones used in this study). As the authors of the paper noted, “In general, lottery winners rated winning the lottery as a highly positive event, and paraplegics rated their accident as a highly negative event, though neither outcome was rated as extremely as might have been expected.” Almost 40 years later, I suspect that most psychologists would agree that this study produced rather weak and inconclusive findings, but that the point it made about the unanticipated power of hedonic adaptation has now been confirmed by many more powerful and methodologically superior studies. You can read the original study [here](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/36/8/917/).","status":"approved","published":true,"type":"correction"},{"timecode":"06:18","text":"**The case of Moreese Bickham**\r\n\r\nThe second mistake occurred when I told the story of Moreese Bickham. I said, “He spent 37 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn’t commit. He was ultimately exonerated, at the age of 78, through DNA evidence.” First, whether Mr. Bickham did or did not commit the crime is debatable. His attorney tells me that he believes Mr. Bickham was innocent, the state evidently believed otherwise, and I am no judge.  Second, Mr. Bickham was not exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence, but rather, was released for good behavior after serving half his sentence.\r\n\r\nHow I managed to mangle these facts is something I still scratch my head about. Bad notes? Bad sources? Demonic possession? Sorry, I just don’t remember. But while I got these ancillary facts wrong, I got the key facts right: Mr. Bickham did spend 37 years in prison, he did utter those words upon his release, and he was (and apparently still is) much happier than most of us would expect ourselves to be in such circumstances. You can read about him [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreese_Bickham).","status":"approved","published":true,"type":"correction"},{"timecode":"18:02","text":"**The irreversible condition**\r\n\r\nThe third mistake was a slip of the tongue that led me to say precisely the opposite of what I meant.

But underneath the goofball brilliance, [he] has a serious argument to make about why human beings are forever wrongly predicting what will make them happy.","whotheyare":"Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong -- a premise he supports with intriguing research, and explains in his accessible and unexpectedly funny book, <em>Stumbling on Happiness.</em>","whylisten":"<p>Dan Gilbert believes that, in our ardent, lifelong pursuit of happiness, most of us have the wrong map. In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>. The immensely readable <em><a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\" target=\"_blank\">Stumbling on Happiness</a>,</em> published in 2006, became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<br /><br />In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life. At 19, he was a high school dropout with dreams of writing science fiction. When a creative writing class at his community college was full, he enrolled in the only available course: psychology. He found his passion there, earned a doctorate in social psychology in 1985 at Princeton, and has since won a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching prize for his work at Harvard. He has written essays and articles for <em>The New York Times, Time</em> and even <a href=\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/STARBUCKS%20CUP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks</a>, while <strong>continuing his research into happiness at his <a href=\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Hedonic Psychology Laboratory</a>.</strong></p>"}],"speaker_name":"Dan Gilbert","tags":["brain","choice","culture","evolution","happiness","psychology","science"],"title":"The surprising science of happiness","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":15685488}]}
