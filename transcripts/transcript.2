											If you&#39;re here today —
											and I&#39;m very happy that you are —
											you&#39;ve all heard about
how sustainable development
											will save us from ourselves.
											However, when we&#39;re not at TED,
we are often told
											that a real sustainability policy agenda
is just not feasible,
											especially in large urban areas
like New York City.
											And that&#39;s because most people
with decision-making powers,
											in both the public and the private sector,
											really don&#39;t feel
as though they&#39;re in danger.

											The reason why I&#39;m here today,
in part, is because of a dog —
											an abandoned puppy I found
back in the rain, back in 1998.
											She turned out to be
a much bigger dog than I&#39;d anticipated.
											When she came into my life, we were
fighting against a huge waste facility
											planned for the East River waterfront
											despite the fact that
our small part of New York City
											already handled more than 40 percent
of the entire city&#39;s commercial waste:
											a sewage treatment pelletizing plant,
a sewage sludge plant, four power plants,
											the world&#39;s largest
food-distribution center,
											as well as other industries that bring
more than 60,000 diesel truck trips
											to the area each week.
											The area also has one of the lowest ratios
of parks to people in the city.

									<p>
											So when I was contacted
by the Parks Department
											about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative
to help develop waterfront projects,
											I thought they were really
well-meaning, but a bit naive.
											I&#39;d lived in this area all my life,
and you could not get to the river,
											because of all the lovely facilities
that I mentioned earlier.
											Then, while jogging
with my dog one morning,
											she pulled me into what I thought
was just another illegal dump.
											There were weeds and piles of garbage
and other stuff that I won&#39;t mention here,
											but she kept dragging me,
											and lo and behold, at the end
of that lot was the river.
											I knew that this forgotten
little street-end,
											abandoned like the dog that brought
me there, was worth saving.
											And I knew it would grow
to become the proud beginnings
											of the community-led revitalization
of the new South Bronx.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And just like my new dog, it was an idea
that got bigger than I&#39;d imagined.
											We garnered much support along the way,
											and the Hunts Point Riverside Park
became the first waterfront park
											that the South Bronx had had
in more than 60 years.
											We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant
more than 300 times,
											into a $3 million park.

											Unfortunately, race and class
are extremely reliable indicators

											Fifty percent of our residents

											At the time, the community was a mostly

their own version of the American dream,

											Red-lining was used by banks,
wherein certain sections of the city,

off-limits to any sort of investment.

											Hunts Point was formerly
a walk-to-work community,
											but now residents had neither
work nor home to walk to.
											A national highway construction boom
was added to our problems.
											In New York State,
											Robert Moses spearheaded
an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.
											One of its primary goals was
to make it easier
											for residents of wealthy communities
in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.
											The South Bronx, which lies in between,
did not stand a chance.
											Residents were often given
less than a month&#39;s notice
											before their buildings were razed.
											600,000 people were displaced.
											The common perception was
											that only pimps and pushers
and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.
											And if you are told
from your earliest days
											that nothing good is going to come
from your community,
											that it&#39;s bad and ugly,
											how could it not reflect on you?
											So now, my family&#39;s property
was worthless,
											save for that it was our home,
and all we had.
											And luckily for me, that home
and the love inside of it,
											along with help from teachers, mentors

											economic degradation
begets environmental degradation,

											The disinvestment that began
in the 1960s set the stage
											for all the environmental
injustices that were to come.

											What costs are associated

											Once we realized that, we decided
it was time to do our own planning.
											That small park I told you about earlier
											was the first stage of building
a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.
											I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million
dollar federal transportation grant
											to design the plan
for a waterfront esplanade
											with dedicated on-street bike paths.
											Physical improvements help inform
public policy regarding traffic safety,
											the placement of the waste
and other facilities,
											which, if done properly, don&#39;t compromise
a community&#39;s quality of life.
											They provide opportunities
to be more physically active,
											as well as local economic development.
											Think bike shops, juice stands.
											We secured 20 million dollars
to build first-phase projects.
											This is Lafayette Avenue —
											and that&#39;s redesigned
by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.
											And once this path is constructed,
it&#39;ll connect the South Bronx
											with more than 400 acres
of Randall&#39;s Island Park.
											Right now we&#39;re separated by about 25 feet
of water, but this link will change that.

											As we nurture the natural environment,
its abundance will give us back even more.
											We run a project called the Bronx
[Environmental] Stewardship Training,
											which provides job training in the fields
of ecological restoration,
											so that folks from our community
have the skills to compete
											for these well-paying jobs.
											Little by little, we&#39;re seeding
the area with green-collar jobs —
											and with people that have both
a financial and personal stake
											in their environment.
											The Sheridan Expressway
is an underutilized relic
											of the Robert Moses era,
											built with no regard for the neighborhoods
that were divided by it.
											Even during rush hour,
it goes virtually unused.
											The community created
an alternative transportation plan
											that allows for the removal
of the highway.
											We have the opportunity now to bring
together all the stakeholders
											to re-envision how this 28 acres
can be better utilized
											for parkland, affordable housing
and local economic development.

											We also built New York City&#39;s first green
and cool roof demonstration project
											on top of our offices.
											Cool roofs are highly-reflective
surfaces that don&#39;t absorb solar heat,

the building or atmosphere.
											Green roofs are soil and living plants.
											Both can be used instead
of petroleum-based roofing materials
											that absorb heat, contribute

up to 75 percent of rainfall,

bus mass-transit systems
											in the entire world.
											For his brilliant efforts,
he was nearly impeached.
											But as people began to see
that they were being put first
											on issues reflecting
their day-to-day lives,
											incredible things happened.
											People stopped littering.
											Crime rates dropped, because the streets
were alive with people.
											His administration attacked several
typical urban problems at one time,
											and on a third-world budget, at that.
											We have no excuse
in this country, I&#39;m sorry.
											But the bottom line is:
their people-first agenda
											was not meant to penalize
those who could actually afford cars,
											but rather, to provide opportunities
for all Bogotanos to participate
											in the city&#39;s resurgence.
											That development should not come
											at the expense of the majority
of the population
											is still considered
a radical idea here in the U.S.
											But Bogota&#39;s example
has the power to change that.

											You, however, are blessed
with the gift of influence.
											That&#39;s why you&#39;re here and why you

											Use your influence

											Don&#39;t just talk about it at TED.
											This is a nationwide policy agenda
I&#39;m trying to build,

politics are personal.
											Help me make green the new black.
											Help me make sustainability sexy.
											Make it a part of your dinner

											Help me fight for environmental

											Support investments

											Help me democratize sustainability

											Listen — when I spoke to Mr. Gore
the other day after breakfast,

activists were going to be included

Now she is leading the local economic development movement across the USA.","whylisten":"<p>Majora Carter is a visionary voice in city planning who views urban renewal through an environmental lens. The South Bronx native draws a direct connection between ecological, economic and social degradation. Hence her motto: <strong>&quot;Green the ghetto!&quot;</strong></p><p>With her inspired ideas and fierce persistence, Carter managed to bring the South Bronx its first open-waterfront park in 60 years, <a href=\"http://www.bronxriver.org/GreenwayGroundbreak.cfm#HPRP\" target=\"_blank\">Hunts Point Riverside Park</a>. Then <strong>she scored $1.25 million in federal funds for a greenway along the South Bronx waterfront</strong>, bringing the neighborhood open space, pedestrian and bike paths, and space for mixed-use economic development.</p><p>Her success is no surprise to anyone who&#39;s seen her speak; <strong>Carter&#39;s confidence, energy and intensely emotional delivery make her talks themselves a force of nature.</strong> (The release of her TEDTalk in 2006 prompted Guy Kawasaki to wonder on his <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/07/as_good_as_stev.html\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>  whether she wasn&#39;t &quot;every bit as good as [Apple CEO] Steve Jobs,&quot; a legendary presenter.)</p><p>Carter, who was awarded a 2005 MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant, served as executive director of <a href=\"http://www.ssbx.org/staff.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable South Bronx</a> for 7 years, where she pushed both for eco-friendly practices (such as green and cool roofs) and, equally important, job training and green-related economic development for her vibrant neighborhood on the rise. Since leaving SSBx in 2008, Carter has formed the economic consulting and planning firm <a href=\"http://www.majoracartergroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the Majora Carter Group</a>, to bring her pioneering approach to communities far outside the South Bronx. Carter is working within the cities of New Orleans, Detroit and the small coastal towns of Northeastern North Carolina. The Majora Carter Group is putting the green economy and green economic tools to use, unlocking the potential of every place -- from urban cities and rural communities, to universities, government projects, businesses and corporations -- and everywhere else in between.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/majora_carter_s_tale_of_urban_renewal","viewed_count":2000421,"talks":[{"curator_approved":true,"description":"In an emotionally charged talk,

Now she is leading the local economic development movement across the USA.","whylisten":"<p>Majora Carter is a visionary voice in city planning who views urban renewal through an environmental lens. The South Bronx native draws a direct connection between ecological, economic and social degradation. Hence her motto: <strong>&quot;Green the ghetto!&quot;</strong></p><p>With her inspired ideas and fierce persistence, Carter managed to bring the South Bronx its first open-waterfront park in 60 years, <a href=\"http://www.bronxriver.org/GreenwayGroundbreak.cfm#HPRP\" target=\"_blank\">Hunts Point Riverside Park</a>. Then <strong>she scored $1.25 million in federal funds for a greenway along the South Bronx waterfront</strong>, bringing the neighborhood open space, pedestrian and bike paths, and space for mixed-use economic development.</p><p>Her success is no surprise to anyone who&#39;s seen her speak; <strong>Carter&#39;s confidence, energy and intensely emotional delivery make her talks themselves a force of nature.</strong> (The release of her TEDTalk in 2006 prompted Guy Kawasaki to wonder on his <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/07/as_good_as_stev.html\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>  whether she wasn&#39;t &quot;every bit as good as [Apple CEO] Steve Jobs,&quot; a legendary presenter.)</p><p>Carter, who was awarded a 2005 MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant, served as executive director of <a href=\"http://www.ssbx.org/staff.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable South Bronx</a> for 7 years, where she pushed both for eco-friendly practices (such as green and cool roofs) and, equally important, job training and green-related economic development for her vibrant neighborhood on the rise. Since leaving SSBx in 2008, Carter has formed the economic consulting and planning firm <a href=\"http://www.majoracartergroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the Majora Carter Group</a>, to bring her pioneering approach to communities far outside the South Bronx. Carter is working within the cities of New Orleans, Detroit and the small coastal towns of Northeastern North Carolina. The Majora Carter Group is putting the green economy and green economic tools to use, unlocking the potential of every place -- from urban cities and rural communities, to universities, government projects, businesses and corporations -- and everywhere else in between.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Majora Carter","tags":["MacArthur grant","activism","business","cities","environment","green","inequality","politics","pollution"],"title":"Greening the ghetto","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2000421}]}
