<title>James Beacham: How we explore unanswered questions in physics | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: James Beacham looks for answers to the most important open questions of physics using the biggest science experiment ever mounted, CERN&#39;s Large Hadron Collider. In this fun and accessible talk about how science happens, Beacham takes us on a journey through extra-spatial dimensions in search of undiscovered fundamental particles (and an explanation for the mysteries of gravity) and details the drive to keep exploring." />

											There is something about physics
											that has been really bothering me
since I was a little kid.
											And it&#39;s related to a question
											that scientists have been asking
for almost 100 years,
											with no answer.
											How do the smallest things in nature,
											the particles of the quantum world,
											match up with the largest
things in nature —
											planets and stars and galaxies
held together by gravity?

									<p>
											As a kid, I would puzzle
over questions just like this.
											I would fiddle around
with microscopes and electromagnets,
											and I would read
about the forces of the small
											and about quantum mechanics
											and I would marvel at how well
that description matched up
											to our observation.
											Then I would look at the stars,
											and I would read about how well
we understand gravity,
											and I would think surely,
there must be some elegant way
											that these two systems match up.
											But there&#39;s not.
											And the books would say,
											yeah, we understand a lot
about these two realms separately,
											but when we try to link
them mathematically,
											everything breaks.

											And for 100 years,
											none of our ideas as to how to solve
this basically physics disaster,
											has ever been supported by evidence.
											And to little old me —
											little, curious, skeptical James —
											this was a supremely unsatisfying answer.

											So, I&#39;m still a skeptical little kid.
											Flash-forward now
to December of 2015,
											when I found myself smack in the middle
											of the physics world
being flipped on its head.
											It all started when we at CERN
saw something intriguing in our data:
											a hint of a new particle,
											an inkling of a possibly extraordinary
answer to this question.

									<p>
											So I&#39;m still a skeptical
little kid, I think,
											but I&#39;m also now a particle hunter.
											I am a physicist at CERN&#39;s
Large Hadron Collider,
											the largest science
experiment ever mounted.
											It&#39;s a 27-kilometer tunnel
on the border of France and Switzerland
											buried 100 meters underground.
											And in this tunnel,
											we use superconducting magnets
colder than outer space
											to accelerate protons
to almost the speed of light
											and slam them into each other
millions of times per second,
											collecting the debris of these collisions
											to search for new, undiscovered
fundamental particles.
											Its design and construction
took decades of work
											by thousands of physicists
from around the globe,
											and in the summer of 2015,
											we had been working tirelessly
to switch on the LHC
											at the highest energy that humans
have ever used in a collider experiment.

									<p>
											Now, higher energy is important
											because for particles,
there is an equivalence
											between energy and particle mass,
											and mass is just a number
put there by nature.
											To discover new particles,
											we need to reach these bigger numbers.
											And to do that, we have to build
a bigger, higher energy collider,
											and the biggest, highest
energy collider in the world
											is the Large Hadron Collider.
											And then, we collide protons
quadrillions of times,
											and we collect this data very slowly,
over months and months.
											And then new particles might show up
in our data as bumps —
											slight deviations from what you expect,
											little clusters of data points
that make a smooth line not so smooth.
											For example, this bump,
											after months of data-taking in 2012,
											led to the discovery
of the Higgs particle —
											the Higgs boson —
											and to a Nobel Prize
for the confirmation of its existence.

											This jump up in energy in 2015
											represented the best chance
that we as a species had ever had
											of discovering new particles —
											new answers to these
long-standing questions,
											because it was almost
twice as much energy as we used
											when we discovered the Higgs boson.
											Many of my colleagues had been working
their entire careers for this moment,
											and frankly, to little curious me,
											this was the moment
I&#39;d been waiting for my entire life.
											So 2015 was go time.

											So June 2015,
											the LHC is switched back on.
											My colleagues and I held our breath
and bit our fingernails,
											and then finally we saw
the first proton collisions
											at this highest energy ever.
											Applause, champagne, celebration.
											This was a milestone for science,
											and we had no idea what we would find
in this brand-new data.
											And then a few weeks later,
we found a bump.
											It wasn&#39;t a very big bump,
											but it was big enough to make
you raise your eyebrow.
											But on a scale of one to 10
for eyebrow raises,
											if 10 indicates that you&#39;ve
discovered a new particle,
											this eyebrow raise is about a four.

But to really understand and appreciate it, you need to dive into the mathematics behind it, that of gauge groups and quantum field theory.  This can be intimidating to many non-specialists. That’s why Bruce Schumm’s book is so good, since it presents the math of the Standard Model without the math, describing the concepts behind the mathematical structures -- and how they map into the physical world -- without overwhelming the reader with equations.  An unparalleled book for getting a deeper sense of what particle physics is all about without getting a PhD (although I also suggest you get that PhD).","note":"Bruce Schumm\r\nJohns Hopkins University Press, 2004","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Down-Things-Breathtaking-Particle/dp/080187971X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":null}]},{"title":"Videos","description":"","rec_items":[{"label":"WATCH","headline":"\"The Pleasure of Finding Things Out\" with Richard Feynman","blurb":"Essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand why physicists do what we do: because we’re insatiably curious.
