											I&#39;m going to go right into the slides.

											And my ideas are —
											in my head, anyway — they&#39;re very logical

											I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems,

											This is in Venice.
											I just show it because I want you to know
											I&#39;m concerned about context.
											On the left-hand side,
											I had the context of those little houses,
											and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.
											When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context
											they look really weird,
											and my premise is that they make a lot more sense
											when they&#39;re photographed or seen in that space.
											And then, once I deal with the context,
											I then try to make a place that&#39;s comfortable and private and fairly serene,
											as I hope you&#39;ll find that slide on the right.

											And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
											I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.
											And we continue to work with this client.
											The building on the right at the top is now under construction.
											The garage on the right — the gray structure — will be torn down,
											finally, and several small classrooms will be placed
											along this avenue that we&#39;ve created, this campus.
											And it all related to the clients and the students
											from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.
											They wanted a sense of place.
											And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space
											in downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.
											And it was my theory, or my point of view,
											that one didn&#39;t upstage the neighborhood —
											one made accommodations.
											I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,
											whether they were buildings I liked or not.

											In the &#39;60s I started working with paper furniture
											and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale&#39;s.
											We even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard.
											And the success of it threw me for a loop.
											I couldn&#39;t deal with the success of furniture —
											I wasn&#39;t secure enough as an architect —
											and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.

											The piece on the left —

											took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up
											to put it in the wastebasket.
											And I put a piece of tape around it,
											as you see there, and realized you could sit on it,
											and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.
											So, it was an accidental discovery.

											I mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism — at po-mo —
											and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man,
											and if you&#39;re going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.
											And so I started making these funny things.
											And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger —
											as the one glass at the Walker.
											And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything
											and tried to translate what I was learning
											about the form of the fish and the movement.
											And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it —
											accidental, again —
											it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it,
											and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal.

											Now, it&#39;s hard to do. It&#39;s hard to translate a fish form,
											because they&#39;re so beautiful — perfect —
											into a building or object like this.
											And Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while,
											told me I couldn&#39;t do it, and so that made it even more exciting.
											But he was right — I couldn&#39;t do the tail.
											I started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn&#39;t do.
											It was pretty hard.
											The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.
											And I put them together, and you walk between them.
											It was a dialog with the context again.
											Now, if you saw a picture of this

											The way we sent drawings to Japan:
											we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models,
											and we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.
											We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.

											I use a lot of metal in my work,

											The whole thing about my house,
											the whole use of rough carpentry and everything,

											I said, &quot;If I can&#39;t get the craft that I want,
											I&#39;ll use the craft I can get.&quot;
											There were plenty of models for that,
											in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists
											who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.
											I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building
											that was a sculpture.
											And it was all of one material,

											The metalworkers, for the most part,

											This is a piece of property in Brentwood.
											And a long time ago, about &#39;82 or something, after my house —
											I designed a house for myself
											that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard —
											and the owner of this lot worked for me
											and built that actual model on the left.
											And she came back,
											I guess wealthier or something — something happened —
											and asked me to design a house for her on this site.
											And following that basic idea of the village,
											we changed it as we got into it.
											I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end —
											here you see on the photographs of the site —
											slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms
											like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,
											which I designed like a kind of a barge,
											looking like a boat.
											And that&#39;s it, built.
											The dome was a request from the client.
											She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.
											She didn&#39;t care where.
											When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope —
											I mean, I haven&#39;t slept in it yet.
											I&#39;ve offered to marry her so I could sleep there,
											but she said I didn&#39;t have to do that.
											But when you&#39;re in that room,
											you feel like you&#39;re on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.
											And it&#39;s very private.
											The landscape is being built around to create a private garden.
											And then up above there&#39;s a garden on this side of the living room,
											and one on the other side.

											Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.
											That&#39;s the living room.
											Servants&#39; quarters.
											A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.
											And then you enter into the living room and then so on.
											This is the bedroom.
											You come down from this level along the stairway,
											and you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.
											And the bed is back in this space,
											with windows looking out onto the lake.
											These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground
											and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.
											The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.
											And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land —
											it&#39;s 100 by 250 — into a kind of an estate by separating these areas
											and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion
											with a high space in it.
											And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis
											with the dining room table.
											It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.
											But the idea is, the windows are all placed
											so you see pieces of the house outside.
											Eventually this will be screened — these trees will come up —
											and it will be very private.
											And you feel like you&#39;re in your own kind of village.

											I&#39;m doing a building in Switzerland, Basel,
											which is an office building for a furniture company.
											And we struggled with the image.
											These are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture
											to normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy,
											then people might say, &quot;Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing,
											but no, it ain&#39;t going to look good in my normal building.&quot;
											So we&#39;ve made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here,

											so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.
											And you&#39;re looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of

											so I understood the problem.
											I was trying to get around this plan coupe — how do you do it?
											Apartments, etc.
											And these are the kind of study models we did.
											And the one on the left is pretty awful.
											You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.
											But out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator piece
											worked frontally to this, parallel to this street,
											and also parallel to here.
											And then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,
											kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.
											The restaurants here — the apartments and the theater, etc.
											So it would all be built in stone, in French limestone,
											except for this metal piece.
											And it faces into a park.
											And the idea was to make this express the energy of this.
											On the side facing the street it&#39;s much more normal,
											except I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point,
											these housing units made a gesture to the corner.
											And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.

											This is the Disney Hall — the concert hall.

											It has a chamber hall.
											It&#39;s related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built

											And it&#39;s not a great building, but I approached it optimistically,

											And the plan of this — it&#39;s a concert hall.
											This is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.
											There&#39;s commercial at the ground floor.
											These are offices, which, really, in the competition,
											we didn&#39;t have to design.
											But finally, there&#39;s a hotel there.

											The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria,
											which led to this compartmentalized scheme,
											which we found out after the competition would not work at all.
											But everybody liked these forms and liked the space,
											and so that&#39;s one of the problems of a competition.
											You have to then try and get that back in some way.
											And we studied many models.
											This was our original model.
											These were the three buildings that were the ideal —
											the Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.
											Everybody liked the surround.
											Actually, this is the smallest hall in size,
											and it has more seats than any of these
											because it has double balconies.
											Our client doesn&#39;t want balconies, so —
											and when we met our new acoustician, he told us
											this was the right shape or this was the right shape.
											And we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy
											of the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.
											We finally settled on a shape that was
											the proportion of the Concertgebouw
											with the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said
											were crucial to this and later decided they weren&#39;t,
											but now we have them.

											And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural
											and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.
											That&#39;s the idea.
											And the corners would have skylights
											and these columns would be structural.
											And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a
											kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit,
											and create intimacy.
											Now, this is not a final design — these are just on the way to being —
											and so I wouldn&#39;t take it literally, except the feeling of the space.
											We studied the acoustics with laser stuff,
											and they bounce them off this and see where it all works.
											But you get the sense of the hall in section.
											Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.
											In this case we&#39;re opening it back up
											and getting skylights in the four corners.
											And so it will be quite a different shape.

											And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel,

											perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of
