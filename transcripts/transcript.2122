<title>Linus Torvalds: The mind behind Linux | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Linus Torvalds transformed technology twice -- first with the Linux kernel, which helps power the Internet, and again with Git, the source code management system used by developers worldwide. In a rare interview with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Torvalds discusses with remarkable openness the personality traits that prompted his unique philosophy of work, engineering and life. &quot;I am not a visionary, I&#39;m an engineer,&quot; Torvalds says. &quot;I&#39;m perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds ... but I&#39;m looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that&#39;s right in front of me before I fall in.&quot;" />

<meta content='The mind behind Linux' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Linus Torvalds transformed technology twice — first with the Linux kernel, which helps power the Internet, and again with Git, the source code management system used by developers worldwide. In a rare interview with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Torvalds discusses with remarkable openness the personality traits that prompted his unique philosophy of work, engineering and life. "I am not a visionary, I&#x0027;m an engineer," Torvalds says. "I&#x0027;m perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds ... but I&#x0027;m looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that&#x0027;s right in front of me before I fall in."' itemprop='description'>

											It&#39;s kind of amazing.
											You must have some amazing
software headquarters driving all this.

											LT: So I guarantee you,
											everybody who raised their hand,

a singly-linked list.
											And it&#39;s taught —
											This, the first not very
good taste approach,
											is basically how it&#39;s taught to be done
when you start out coding.

											The most interesting part to me

in a singly-linked list —
											this is trying to remove
an existing entry from a list —
											and there&#39;s a difference
between if it&#39;s the first entry
											or whether it&#39;s an entry in the middle.
											Because if it&#39;s the first entry,
											you have to change
the pointer to the first entry.
											If it&#39;s in the middle,
											you have to change the pointer
of a previous entry.
											So they&#39;re two completely different cases.

											that sometimes you can see
a problem in a different way

											LT: So, I&#39;m of two minds there.
											I think one reason open source
works so well in code
											is that at the end of the day,
											code tends to be somewhat black and white.
											There&#39;s often a fairly good way to decide,
											this is done correctly
and this is not done well.
											Code either works or it doesn&#39;t,
											which means that there&#39;s less
room for arguments.
											And we have arguments despite this, right?
											In many other areas —
											I mean, people have talked about
open politics and things like that —
											and it&#39;s really hard sometimes to say
											that, yes, you can apply the same
principles in some other areas
											just because the black and white
turns into not just gray,
											but different colors.

											So, obviously open source in science
is making a comeback.
											Science was there first.
											But then science ended up
being pretty closed,
											with very expensive journals
and some of that going on.
											And open source is making
a comeback in science,
											with things like arXiv and open journals.
											Wikipedia changed the world, too.
											So there are other examples,
