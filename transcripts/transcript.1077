											When I was seven years old
and my sister was just five years old,
											we were playing on top of a bunk bed.
											I was two years older
than my sister at the time —
											I mean, I&#39;m two years
older than her now —
											but at the time it meant she had to do
everything that I wanted to do,
											and I wanted to play war.
											So we were up on top of our bunk beds.
											And on one side of the bunk bed,
											I had put out all of my G.I. Joe
soldiers and weaponry.
											And on the other side were
all my sister&#39;s My Little Ponies
											ready for a cavalry charge.

on the clumsy side.
											Somehow, without any help or push
from her older brother at all,
											Amy disappeared
off of the top of the bunk bed
											and landed with this crash on the floor.
											I nervously peered
over the side of the bed
											to see what had befallen my fallen sister
											and saw that she had landed

											&quot;How fast does the average child

											If you fall below the average,

depressed or have a disorder,

											We&#39;re hoping for both

session with one problem,

											The absence of disease is not health.

											In the last three years,
I&#39;ve traveled to 45 countries,
											working with schools and companies
in the midst of an economic downturn.
											And I found that
most companies and schools
											follow a formula
for success, which is this:
											If I work harder, I&#39;ll be more successful.
											And if I&#39;m more successful,
then I&#39;ll be happier.
											That undergirds most
of our parenting and managing styles,

									<p>
											And the problem is it&#39;s scientifically
broken and backwards for two reasons.
											Every time your brain has a success,
											you just changed the goalpost
of what success looked like.
											You got good grades,
now you have to get better grades,
											you got into a good school
and after you get into a better one,
											you got a good job,
now you have to get a better job,
											you hit your sales target,
we&#39;re going to change it.
											And if happiness is on the opposite side
of success, your brain never gets there.
											We&#39;ve pushed happiness
over the cognitive horizon, as a society.
											And that&#39;s because we think
we have to be successful,
											then we&#39;ll be happier.

											But our brains work in the opposite order.
											If you can raise somebody&#39;s level
of positivity in the present,
											then their brain experiences what we now
call a happiness advantage,
											which is your brain at positive
performs significantly better
											than at negative, neutral or stressed.
											Your intelligence rises, your creativity
rises, your energy levels rise.
											In fact, we&#39;ve found that every single
business outcome improves.
											Your brain at positive
is 31% more productive
											than your brain at negative,
neutral or stressed.
											You&#39;re 37% better at sales.
											Doctors are 19 percent

positive in the present,

even more successfully

faster and more intelligently.
											We need to be able to reverse this formula
											so we can start to see what our brains
are actually capable of.
											Because dopamine, which floods
into your system when you&#39;re positive,
											has two functions.
											Not only does it make you happier,
											it turns on all of the learning
centers in your brain
											allowing you to adapt
to the world in a different way.

											We&#39;ve found there are ways
that you can train your brain
											to be able to become more positive.
											In just a two-minute span of time
done for 21 days in a row,
											we can actually rewire your brain,
											allowing your brain to actually work
more optimistically and more successfully.
											We&#39;ve done these things in research now
											in every company that I&#39;ve worked with,
											getting them to write down three new
things that they&#39;re grateful for
											for 21 days in a row,
three new things each day.
											And at the end of that,
											their brain starts to retain a pattern
											of scanning the world not for
the negative, but for the positive first.

											Journaling about one positive experience
you&#39;ve had over the past 24 hours
											allows your brain to relive it.
											Exercise teaches your brain
that your behavior matters.
											We find that meditation allows your brain
											to get over the cultural ADHD
that we&#39;ve been creating
											by trying to do multiple tasks at once
											and allows our brains
to focus on the task at hand.
											And finally, random acts of kindness
are conscious acts of kindness.
											We get people,
when they open up their inbox,
											to write one positive email
											praising or thanking somebody
in their support network.

									<p>
											And by doing these activities
											and by training your brain
just like we train our bodies,
											what we&#39;ve found is we can reverse
the formula for happiness and success,
											and in doing so, not only create
ripples of positivity,
											but a real revolution.
