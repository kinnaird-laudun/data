											Check out those killer equations. Sweet.
											Actually, for the next 18 minutes
I&#39;m going to do the best I can
											to describe the beauty
of particle physics without equations.
											It turns out there&#39;s a lot
we can learn from coral.
											A coral is a very beautiful
and unusual animal.
											Each coral head consists
of thousands of individual polyps.
											These polyps are continually
budding and branching
											into genetically identical neighbors.
											If we imagine this
to be a hyperintelligent coral,
											we can single out an individual
and ask him a reasonable question.
											We can ask how exactly
he got to be in this particular location
											compared to his neighbors —
											if it was just chance,
or destiny, or what?

											Now, after admonishing us
for turning the temperature up too high,
											he would tell us that our question
was completely stupid.
											These corals can be kind of mean, you see,
											and I have surfing scars to prove that.
											But this polyp would continue and tell us
											that his neighbors were
quite clearly identical copies of him.
											That he was in all
these other locations as well,
											but experiencing them
as separate individuals.
											For a coral, branching
into different copies
											is the most natural thing in the world.

											Unlike us, a hyperintelligent coral
											would be uniquely prepared
to understand quantum mechanics.
											The mathematics of quantum mechanics
											very accurately describes
how our universe works.
											And it tells us our reality is continually
branching into different possibilities,
											just like a coral.
											It&#39;s a weird thing for us humans
to wrap our minds around,
											since we only ever get
to experience one possibility.
											This quantum weirdness was first described
											by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.
											The cat likes this version better.

											In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box
with a radioactive sample
											that, by the laws of quantum mechanics,
branches into a state
											in which it is radiated
and a state in which it is not.

											In the branch in which
the sample radiates,
											it sets off a trigger that releases poison
and Schrödinger is dead.
											But in the other branch of reality,
he remains alive.
											These realities are experienced
separately by each individual.
											As far as either can tell,
the other one doesn&#39;t exist.

											This seems weird to us,
											because each of us
only experiences an individual existence,
											and we don&#39;t get to see other branches.
											It&#39;s as if each of us,
like Schrödinger here,
											are a kind of coral
branching into different possibilities.
											The mathematics
of quantum mechanics tells us
											this is how the world
works at tiny scales.
											It can be summed up in a single sentence:
											Everything that can happen, does.
											That&#39;s quantum mechanics.
											But this does not mean everything happens.
											The rest of physics is about describing
what can happen and what can&#39;t.
											What physics tells us
is that everything comes down to geometry
											and the interactions
of elementary particles.
											And things can happen only if
these interactions are perfectly balanced.

									<p>
											Now I&#39;ll go ahead and describe
how we know about these particles,
											what they are and how this balance works.
											In this machine,
a beam of protons and antiprotons
											are accelerated to near the speed of light
											and brought together in a collision,
producing a burst of pure energy.
											This energy is immediately converted
into a spray of subatomic particles,
											with detectors and computers
used to figure out their properties.
											This enormous machine —
											the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN in Geneva —
											has a circumference of 17 miles
and, when it&#39;s operating,
											draws five times as much power
as the city of Monterey.
											We can&#39;t predict specifically
											what particles will be produced
in any individual collision.
											Quantum mechanics tells us
all possibilities are realized.
											But physics does tell us
what particles can be produced.
											These particles must have
just as much mass and energy
											as is carried in
by the proton and antiproton.
											Any particles more massive
than this energy limit aren&#39;t produced,
											and remain invisible to us.
											This is why this new
particle accelerator is so exciting.
											It&#39;s going to push
this energy limit seven times
											beyond what&#39;s ever been done before,
											so we&#39;re going to get to see
some new particles very soon.

a neutral partner called the neutrino,

											In contrast, the up and down quarks
have very large masses,

the protons and neutrons inside atoms.

to understand here

											Now, if we count up
all these different particles
											using their various spins and charges,
											there are 226.
											That&#39;s a lot of particles
to keep track of.
											And it seems strange
											that nature would have
so many elementary particles.
											But if we plot them out
according to their charges,
											some beautiful patterns emerge.
											The most familiar charge
is electric charge.
											Electrons have an electric charge,
											a negative one,
											and quarks have
electric charges in thirds.
											So when two up quarks and a down quark
are combined to make a proton,
											it has a total
electric charge of plus one.
											These particles also have antiparticles,
which have opposite charges.
											Now, it turns out the electric charge
											is actually a combination
of two other charges:
											hypercharge and weak charge.
											If we spread out
the hypercharge and weak charge
											and plot the charges of particles
in this two-dimensional charge space,
											the electric charge
is where these particles sit
											along the vertical direction.
											The electromagnetic
and weak forces interact with matter
											according to their hypercharge
and weak charge,
											which make this pattern.
											This is called
the unified electroweak model,
											and it was put together back in 1967.

								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The reason most of us
are only familiar with electric charge
											and not both of these
is because of the Higgs particle.
											The Higgs, over here on the left,
has a large mass
											and breaks the symmetry
of this electroweak pattern.
											It makes the weak force very weak
by giving the weak particles a large mass.
											Since this massive Higgs sits along
the horizontal direction in this diagram,
											the photons of electromagnetism
remain massless
											and interact with electric charge
along the vertical direction
											in this charge space.
											So the electromagnetic and weak forces
											are described by this pattern
of particle charges
											in two-dimensional space.
											We can include the strong force
by spreading out its two charge directions
											and plotting the charges
of the force particles in quarks
											along these directions.
											The charges of all known particles
											can be plotted in
a four-dimensional charge space,
											and projected down to two dimensions
like this so we can see them.

											Whenever particles interact,
nature keeps things in a perfect balance
											along all four of these charge directions.
											If a particle and an antiparticle collide,
											it creates a burst of energy
and a total charge of zero
											in all four charge directions.
											At this point, anything can be created
											as long as it has the same energy
and maintains a total charge of zero.
											For example, this weak force particle
and its antiparticle
											can be created in a collision.
											In further interactions,
the charges must always balance.
											One of the weak particles could decay
into an electron and an antineutrino,
											and these three
still add to zero total charge.
											Nature always keeps a perfect balance.
											So these patterns of charges
are not just pretty.
											They tell us what interactions
are allowed to happen.
											And we can rotate this charge space
in four dimensions
											to get a better look
at the strong interaction,
											which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.
											In a strong interaction,
a strong force particle,
											such as this one,
											interacts with a colored quark,
such as this green one,
											to give a quark with a different
color charge — this red one.
											And strong interactions
are happening millions of times
											each second in every atom of our bodies,
											holding the atomic nuclei together.

											But these four charges
corresponding to three forces
											are not the end of the story.
											We can also include two more charges
corresponding to the gravitational force.
											When we include these,
											each matter particle
has two different spin charges,
											spin-up and spin-down.
											So they all split and give a nice pattern
in six-dimensional charge space.
											We can rotate this pattern
in six dimensions
											and see that it&#39;s quite pretty.
											Right now, this pattern
matches our best current knowledge
											of how nature is built at the tiny scales
of these elementary particles.
											This is what we know for certain.
											Some of these particles
are at the very limit
											of what we&#39;ve been able to reach
with experiments.
											From this pattern
											we already know the particle physics
of these tiny scales —
											the way the universe works
at these tiny scales is very beautiful.

some new and old ideas

on the whole enchilada.
											We want to find
all the particles and forces

											So there&#39;s an old idea in particle physics
											that this known pattern of charges,
											which is not very symmetric,
											could emerge from a more perfect pattern
that gets broken —
											similar to how the Higgs particle
breaks the electroweak pattern
											to give electromagnetism.
											In order to do this,
we need to introduce new forces
											with new charge directions.
											When we introduce a new direction,
											we get to guess what charges
the particles have along this direction,
											and then we can rotate it
in with the others.
											If we guess wisely,
we can construct the standard charges
											in six charge dimensions
as a broken symmetry
											of this more perfect pattern
in seven charge dimensions.

											This particular choice
corresponds to a grand unified theory
											introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.
											When we look at this new unified pattern,
											we can see a couple of gaps
where particles seem to be missing.
											This is the way
theories of unification work.
											A physicist looks for larger,
more symmetric patterns
											that include the established
pattern as a subset.
											The larger pattern allows us
to predict the existence of particles
											that have never been seen.
											This unification model
predicts the existence
											of these two new force particles,

of charges in seven dimensions

about the matter particles:

											have exactly the same charges
in six-dimensional charge space
											as the first generation.
											These particles are not
uniquely identified by their six charges.
											They sit on top of one another
in the standard charge space.
											However, if we work
in eight-dimensional charge space,
											then we can assign
unique new charges to each particle.
											Then we can spin these in eight dimensions
											and see what the whole pattern looks like.
											Here we can see the second

											This particular pattern

											In 1623, Galileo wrote this:

											CA: That&#39;s right.
											The reason it&#39;s got
a few people at least excited
											is because, if you&#39;re right, it brings
gravity and quantum theory together.
											So are you saying that we should
think of the universe, at its heart —
											that the smallest things that there are,
											are somehow an E8 object of possibility?
											I mean, is there a scale to it,
at the smallest scale, or ...?

											GL: Well, right now
the pattern I showed you
											that corresponds to what we know
about elementary particle physics —
											that already corresponds
to a very beautiful shape.
											And that&#39;s the one
that I said we knew for certain.
											And that shape
has remarkable similarities —
											and the way it fits into this E8 pattern,
which could be the rest of the picture.
											And these patterns of points
that I&#39;ve shown for you
											actually represent symmetries
of this high-dimensional object
											that would be warping
and moving and dancing
											over the space-time that we experience.
											And that would be what explains all these
elementary particles that we see.

											CA: But a string theorist,
as I understand it,
											explains electrons in terms
of much smaller strings vibrating —
											I know, you don&#39;t like string theory —
vibrating inside it.
											How should we think
of an electron in relation to E8?

											GL: Well, it would be one
of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
											So what&#39;s happening is, as the shape
is moving over space-time, it&#39;s twisting.
											And the direction it&#39;s twisting
as it moves is what particle we see.
											So it would be —

									<p>
											CA: The size of the E8 shape,
how does that relate to the electron?
											I feel like I need that for my picture.
Is it bigger? Is it smaller?

									<p>
											GL: As far as we know,
electrons are point particles,
											so this would be going down
to the smallest possible scales.
											So the way these things are explained
in quantum field theory is,
											all possibilities are expanding
and developing at once.
											And this is why
I use the analogy to coral.
											And —
											in this way, the way that E8 comes in
											is it will be as a shape that&#39;s attached
at each point in the space-time.
											And, as I said,
the way the shape twists —
											the directional along which way
the shape is twisting
											as it moves over this curved surface —
											is what the elementary particles
are, themselves.
											So through quantum field theory,
											they manifest themselves as points
and interact that way.
											I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able
to make this any clearer.
