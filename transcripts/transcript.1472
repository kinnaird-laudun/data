											But then the great famine began in 1994.

											My sister and I would go searching for firewood
											starting at 5 in the morning

											I would wander the streets searching for food,

											Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time,
											and in 2003, when I was 13 years old,
											my father became one of them.
											I saw my father wither away and die.
											In the same year, my mother disappeared one day,
											and then my sister told me
											that she was going to China to earn money,
											but that she would return with money and food soon.
											Since we had never been separated,
											and I thought we would be together forever,
											I didn&#39;t even give her a hug when she left.
											It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life.
											But again, I didn&#39;t know
											it was going to be a long goodbye.

											Suddenly, I became an orphan and homeless.
											My daily life became very hard,
											but very simple.
											My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash.
											But that is no way to survive.
											I started to realize, begging would not be the solution.
											So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets.
											Sometimes, I found small jobs
											in exchange for food.
											Once, I even spent two months in the winter
											working in a coal mine,
											33 meters underground without any protection
											for up to 16 hours a day.
											I was not uncommon.
											Many other orphans survived this way, or worse.

											When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold
											or hunger pains,
											I hoped that, the next morning,
											my sister would come back to wake me up
											with my favorite food.
											That hope kept me alive.
											I don&#39;t mean big, grand hope.
											I mean the kind of hope that made me believe
											that the next trash can had bread,
											even though it usually didn&#39;t.
											But if I didn&#39;t believe it, I wouldn&#39;t even try,
											and then I would die.
											Hope kept me alive.
											Every day, I told myself,
											no matter how hard things got,
											still I must live.

											After three years of waiting for my sister&#39;s return,
											I decided to go to China to look for her myself.
											I realized
											I couldn&#39;t survive much longer this way.
											I knew the journey would be risky,

											I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea,
											or at least I could try for a better life
											by escaping to China.

											I had learned that many people tried to cross

											North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people
											trying to cross the border without permission.
											Chinese soldiers will catch
											and send back North Koreans,
											where they face severe punishment.
											I decided to cross during the day,
											first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark,
											second because I knew I was already taking a risk,
											and since not many people tried to cross during the day,
											I thought I might be able to cross
											without being seen by anyone.

											I went to America without knowing a word of English,

											Even in North Korea, I was an F student.
											(Laughter)
											And I barely finished elementary school.
											And I remember I fought in school more than once a day.
											Textbooks and the library were not my playground.
											My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying,
											but it didn&#39;t work.
											At one point, my father gave up on me.
											He said, &quot;You&#39;re not my son anymore.&quot;
											I was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply.

											still didn&#39;t change before he died.
											So in America, it was kind of ridiculous

											But one day, I came home and my foster mother
											had made chicken wings for dinner.
											And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing,
											but I realized there were not enough for everyone,
											so I decided against it.
											When I looked down at my plate,
											I saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his.
											I was so happy.
											I looked at him sitting next to me.
											He just looked back at me very warmly,
											but said no words.
											Suddenly I remembered my biological father.
											My foster father&#39;s small act of love
											reminded me of my father,
											who would love to share his food with me
											when he was hungry, even if he was starving.
											I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America,
											yet my father died of starvation.
											My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him,
											and that night I also thought of what else I could do
											to honor him.
											And my answer was to promise to myself
											that I would study hard and get the best education
											in America to honor his sacrifice.

											This is my message to you.
											Have hope for yourself,

											Life can be hard for everyone, wherever you live.
											My foster father didn&#39;t intend to change my life.
											In the same way, you may also change someone&#39;s life
											with even the smallest act of love.
											A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger,
