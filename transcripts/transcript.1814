											Vision is the most important
											and prioritized sense that we have.
											We are constantly looking
											at the world around us,
											and quickly we identify and make sense
											of what it is that we see.
									</p>
								</div>

											Let&#39;s just start with an example
											of that very fact.
											I&#39;m going to show you
a photograph of a person,
											just for a second or two,
											and I&#39;d like for you to identify
											what emotion is on his face.
											Ready?
											Here you go. Go with your gut reaction.
											Okay. What did you see?
											Well, we actually surveyed
											over 120 individuals,
											and the results were mixed.
											People did not agree
											on what emotion they saw on his face.
											Maybe you saw discomfort.
											That was the most frequent response
											that we received.
											But if you asked the person on your left,
											they might have said regret or skepticism,
											and if you asked somebody on your right,
											they might have said
something entirely different,
											like hope or empathy.
											So we are all looking
											at the very same face again.
											We might see something
											entirely different,
											because perception is subjective.
											What we think we see
											is actually filtered
											through our own mind&#39;s eye.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Of course, there are many other examples
											of how we see the world
through own mind&#39;s eye.
											I&#39;m going to give you just a few.
											So dieters, for instance,
											see apples as larger
											than people who are not counting calories.
											Softball players see the ball as smaller
											if they&#39;ve just come out of a slump,
											compared to people who 
had a hot night at the plate.
											And actually, our political beliefs also
											can affect the way we see other people,
											including politicians.
											So my research team and I
decided to test this question.
											In 2008, Barack Obama
was running for president
											for the very first time,
											and we surveyed hundreds of Americans
											one month before the election.
											What we found in this survey
											was that some people, some Americans,
											think photographs like these
											best reflect how Obama really looks.
											Of these people, 75 percent
											voted for Obama in the actual election.
											Other people, though,
thought photographs like these
											best reflect how Obama really looks.
											89 percent of these people
											voted for McCain.
											We presented many photographs of Obama
											one at a time,
											so people did not realize
that what we were changing
											from one photograph to the next
											was whether we had artificially lightened
											or darkened his skin tone.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So how is that possible?
											How could it be that
when I look at a person,
											an object, or an event,
											I see something very different
											than somebody else does?
											Well, the reasons are many,
											but one reason requires that we understand
											a little bit more about how our eyes work.
											So vision scientists know
											that the amount of information
											that we can see
											at any given point in time,
											what we can focus on,
is actually relatively small.
											What we can see with great sharpness
											and clarity and accuracy
											is the equivalent
											of the surface area of our thumb
											on our outstretched arm.
											Everything else around that is blurry,
											rendering much of what is presented
											to our eyes as ambiguous.
											But we have to clarify
											and make sense of what it is that we see,
											and it&#39;s our mind that
helps us fill in that gap.
											As a result, perception
is a subjective experience,
											and that&#39;s how we end up seeing
											through our own mind&#39;s eye.

											So, I&#39;m a social psychologist,
											and it&#39;s questions like these
											that really intrigue me.
											I am fascinated by those times
											when people do not see eye to eye.
											Why is it that somebody might
											literally see the glass as half full,
											and somebody literally sees it
											as half empty?
											What is it about what one person
is thinking and feeling
											that leads them to see the world
											in an entirely different way?
											And does that even matter?
											So to begin to tackle these questions,
											my research team and I
decided to delve deeply
											into an issue that has received
											international attention:
											our health and fitness.
											Across the world,
											people are struggling
to manage their weight,
											and there is a variety of strategies
											that we have to help us
keep the pounds off.
											For instance, we set
the best of intentions
											to exercise after the holidays,
											but actually, the majority of Americans
											find that their New Year&#39;s resolutions
											are broken by Valentine&#39;s Day.
											We talk to ourselves
											in very encouraging ways,
											telling ourselves this is our year
											to get back into shape,
											but that is not enough to bring us back
											to our ideal weight.
											So why?
											Of course, there is no simple answer,
											but one reason, I argue,
											is that our mind&#39;s eye
											might work against us.
											Some people may literally see exercise
											as more difficult,
											and some people might literally
											see exercise as easier.

									<p>
											So, as a first step
to testing these questions,
											we gathered objective measurements
											of individuals&#39; physical fitness.
											We measured the 
circumference of their waist,
											compared to the 
circumference of their hips.
											A higher waist-to-hip ratio
											is an indicator of being
less physically fit
											than a lower waist-to-hip ratio.
											After gathering these measurements,
											we told our participants that
											they would walk to a finish line
											while carrying extra weight
											in a sort of race.
											But before they did that,
											we asked them to estimate the distance
											to the finish line.
											We thought that the physical
states of their body
											might change how
they perceived the distance.
											So what did we find?
											Well, waist-to-hip ratio
											predicted perceptions of distance.
											People who were out of shape and unfit
											actually saw the distance
to the finish line
											as significantly greater
											than people who were in better shape.
											People&#39;s states of their own body
											changed how they
perceived the environment.
											But so too can our mind.
											In fact, our bodies and our minds
											work in tandem
											to change how we see the world around us.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											That led us to think that maybe people
											with strong motivations
											and strong goals to exercise
											might actually see
the finish line as closer
											than people who have weaker motivations.
											So to test whether motivations
											affect our perceptual
experiences in this way,
											we conducted a second study.
											Again, we gathered objective measurements
											of people&#39;s physical fitness,
											measuring the circumference of their waist
											and the circumference of their hips,
											and we had them do a 
few other tests of fitness.
											Based on feedback that we gave them,
											some of our participants told us
											they&#39;re not motivated
to exercise any more.
											They felt like they already
met their fitness goals
											and they weren&#39;t going
to do anything else.
											These people were not motivated.
											Other people, though, 
based on our feedback,
											told us they were highly 
motivated to exercise.
											They had a strong goal
to make it to the finish line.
											But again, before we had them
walk to the finish line,
											we had them estimate the distance.
											How far away was the finish line?
											And again, like the previous study,
											we found that waist-to-hip ratio
											predicted perceptions of distance.
											Unfit individuals saw
the distance as farther,
											saw the finish line as farther away,
											than people who were in better shape.
											Importantly, though, this only happened
											for people who were not motivated
											to exercise.
											On the other hand,
											people who were highly
motivated to exercise
											saw the distance as short.
											Even the most out of shape individuals
											saw the finish line
											as just as close,
											if not slightly closer,
											than people who were in better shape.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So our bodies can change
											how far away that finish line looks,
											but people who had committed
to a manageable goal
											that they could accomplish
in the near future
											and who believed that they were capable
											of meeting that goal
											actually saw the exercise as easier.
											That led us to wonder,
											is there a strategy that we could use
											and teach people that would help
											change their perceptions of the distance,
											help them make exercise look easier?

									<p>
											So we turned to
the vision science literature
											to figure out what should we do,
											and based on what we read,
we came up with a strategy
											that we called, &quot;Keep 
your eyes on the prize.&quot;
											So this is not the slogan
											from an inspirational poster.
											It&#39;s an actual directive
											for how to look around your environment.
											People that we trained in this strategy,
											we told them to focus
their attention on the finish line,
											to avoid looking around,
											to imagine a spotlight
											was shining on that goal,
											and that everything around it was blurry
											and perhaps difficult to see.
											We thought that this strategy
											would help make the exercise look easier.
											We compared this group
											to a baseline group.
											To this group we said,
											just look around the environment
											as you naturally would.
											You will notice the finish line,
											but you might also notice
											the garbage can off to the right,
											or the people and the 
lamp post off to the left.
											We thought that people
who used this strategy
											would see the distance as farther.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So what did we find?
											When we had them estimate the distance,
											was this strategy successful
											for changing their perceptual experience?
											Yes.
											People who kept their eyes on the prize
											saw the finish line as 30 percent closer
											than people who looked around
											as they naturally would.
											We thought this was great.
											We were really excited because it meant
											that this strategy helped make
											the exercise look easier,
											but the big question was,
											could this help make exercise
											actually better?
											Could it improve the quality
											of exercise as well?

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So next, we told our participants,
											you are going to walk to the finish line
											while wearing extra weight.
											We added weights to their ankles
											that amounted to 15 percent
of their body weight.
											We told them to lift their knees up high
											and walk to the finish line quickly.
											We designed this exercise in particular
											to be moderately challenging
											but not impossible,
											like most exercises
											that actually improve our fitness.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the big question, then:
											Did keeping your eyes on the prize
											and narrowly focusing on the finish line
											change their experience of the exercise?
											It did.
											People who kept their eyes on the prize
											told us afterward that it required
											17 percent less exertion
											for them to do this exercise
											than people who looked around naturally.
											It changed their subjective experience
											of the exercise.
											It also changed the objective nature
											of their exercise.
											People who kept their eyes on the prize
											actually moved 23 percent faster
											than people who looked around naturally.
											To put that in perspective,
											a 23 percent increase
											is like trading in your
1980 Chevy Citation
											for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We were so excited by this,
											because this meant that a strategy
											that costs nothing,
											that is easy for people to use,
											regardless of whether they&#39;re in shape
											or struggling to get there,
											had a big effect.
											Keeping your eyes on the prize
											made the exercise look and feel easier
											even when people were working harder
											because they were moving faster.
											Now, I know there&#39;s more to good health
											than walking a little bit faster,
											but keeping your eyes on the prize
											might be one additional strategy
											that you can use to help promote
											a healthy lifestyle.

											If you&#39;re not convinced yet
											that we all see the world
through our own mind&#39;s eye,
											let me leave you with one final example.
											Here&#39;s a photograph of a beautiful 
street in Stockholm, with two cars.
											The car in the back looks much larger
											than the car in the front.
											However, in reality,
											these cars are the same size,
											but that&#39;s not how we see it.
											So does this mean that
											our eyes have gone haywire
											and that our brains are a mess?
											No, it doesn&#39;t mean that at all.
											It&#39;s just how our eyes work.
											We might see the world in a different way,
											and sometimes that might not
											line up with reality,
											but it doesn&#39;t mean
that one of us is right
											and one of us is wrong.
											We all see the world
through our mind&#39;s eye,
											but we can teach ourselves
to see it differently.

											So I can think of days
											that have gone horribly wrong for me.
											I&#39;m fed up, I&#39;m grumpy, I&#39;m tired,
											and I&#39;m so behind,
											and there&#39;s a big black cloud
											hanging over my head,
											and on days like these,
											it looks like everyone around me
											is down in the dumps too.
											My colleague at work looks annoyed
											when I ask for an extension on a deadline,
											and my friend looks frustrated
											when I show up late for lunch
because a meeting ran long,
											and at the end of the day,
											my husband looks disappointed
											because I&#39;d rather go to 
bed than go to the movies.
											And on days like these,
when everybody looks
											upset and angry to me,
											I try to remind myself that there
are other ways of seeing them.
											Perhaps my colleague was confused,
											perhaps my friend was concerned,
											and perhaps my husband was 
feeling empathy instead.
											So we all see the world
											through our own mind&#39;s eye,
											and on some days, it might look
											like the world is a dangerous
											and challenging and insurmountable place,
											but it doesn&#39;t have to look
that way all the time.
											We can teach ourselves
to see it differently,
											and when we find a way to make the world
											look nicer and easier,
											it might actually become so.

Through her research at New York University she explores how small differences in perception, whether conscious or nonconscious, can have potentially major consequences. For example, in a series of studies conducted in 2009 Balcetis helped show that people who saw Barack Obama as lighter skinned tended to report voting for him in the 2008 presidential election -- and vice versa.</p><p>Her current work focuses on how video evidence can bias jury members differently and how our vision can work against us when it comes to effective exercise. Balcetis&#39; goal is to show that through our awareness of these biases, we can also overcome them, for an ever so slightly less daunting world.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Emily Balcetis","tags":["TEDx","decision-making","health","mind","psychology","motivation","exercise"],"title":"Why some people find exercise harder than others","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":3386841}]}
