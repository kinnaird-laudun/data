<title>Allan Savory: How to fight desertification and reverse climate change | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: &quot;Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,&quot; begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk.

<meta content='How to fight desertification and reverse climate change' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='"Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert," begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And it&#x0027;s happening to about two-thirds of the world&#x0027;s grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes — and his work may show — that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert. (NOTE: Statements in this talk have been challenged by scientists working in this field. Please read "Criticisms &amp; Updates" below for more details.)' itemprop='description'>

											to create vast areas of bare ground.
											No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.
											And we have environments
											where we have months of humidity
											followed by months of dryness,
											and that is where desertification is occurring.
											Fortunately, with space technology now,
											we can look at it from space,
											and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.
											Generally, what you see in green
											is not desertifying,
											and what you see in brown is,
											and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.
											About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.

											I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert
											while 25 millimeters — that&#39;s an inch of rain — was falling.
											Think of it in terms of drums of water,
											each containing 200 liters.
											Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare
											of that land that day.
											The next day, the land looked like this.
											Where had that water gone?
											Some of it ran off as flooding,
											but most of the water that soaked into the soil
											simply evaporated out again,
											exactly as it does in your garden
											if you leave the soil uncovered.
											Now, because the fate of water and carbon
											are tied to soil organic matter,
											when we damage soils, you give off carbon.
											Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.

											Now you&#39;re told over and over, repeatedly,
											that desertification is only occurring
											in arid and semi-arid areas of the world,
											and that tall grasslands like this one
											in high rainfall are of no consequence.
											But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,
											you find that most of the soil in that grassland
											that you&#39;ve just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,
											leading to increased runoff and evaporation.
											That is the cancer of desertification

											When I was a young man,
											a young biologist in Africa,
											I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas
											as future national parks.
											Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s —
											and no sooner did we remove the hunting,
											drum-beating people to protect the animals,
											than the land began to deteriorate,
											as you see in this park that we formed.
											Now, no livestock were involved,
											but suspecting that we had too many elephants now,
											I did the research and I proved we had too many,
											and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers
											and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.
											Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,
											and it was political dynamite, frankly.
											So our government formed a team of experts
											to evaluate my research.
											They did. They agreed with me,
											and over the following years,
											we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.
											And it got worse, not better.
											Loving elephants as I do,
											that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,
											and I will carry that to my grave.
											One good thing did come out of it.
											It made me absolutely determined
											to devote my life to finding solutions.

											When I came to the United States, I got a shock,
											to find national parks like this one
											desertifying as badly as anything in Africa.
											And there&#39;d been no livestock on this land
											for over 70 years.
											And I found that American scientists
											had no explanation for this
											except that it is arid and natural.
											So I then began looking
											at all the research plots I could
											over the whole of the Western United States
											where cattle had been removed
											to prove that it would stop desertification,
											but I found the opposite,
											as we see on this research station,
											where this grassland that was green in 1961,
											by 2002 had changed to that situation.
											And the authors of the position paper on climate change
											from which I obtained these pictures

											Clearly, we have never understood

											Take one square meter of soil

											and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn

											than that same piece of ground if it&#39;s just covered with litter,

											Now, by the time you are doing that

											What we had failed to understand
											was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,
											the soil and the vegetation
											developed with very large numbers of grazing animals,
											and that these grazing animals
											developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators.
											Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators
											is to get into herds,
											and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.
											Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,
											and they have to keep moving,
											and it was that movement
											that prevented the overgrazing of plants,
											while the periodic trampling
											ensured good cover of the soil,

											This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.
											It has just come through four months of rain,
											and it&#39;s now going into eight months of dry season.
											And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.
											Now, all of that grass you see aboveground
											has to decay biologically
											before the next growing season, and if it doesn&#39;t,
											the grassland and the soil begin to die.
											Now, if it does not decay biologically,
											it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,
											and this smothers and kills grasses,
											leading to a shift to woody vegetation
											and bare soil, releasing carbon.
											To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.
											But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,
											and worse than that,
											burning one hectare of grassland
											gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants
											than 6,000 cars.
											And we are burning in Africa, every single year,
											more than one billion hectares of grasslands,
											and almost nobody is talking about it.
											We justify the burning, as scientists,
											because it does remove the dead material

											What are we going to do?
											There is only one option,

											When I first realized
											that we had no option as scientists
											but to use much-vilified livestock
											to address climate change and desertification,
											I was faced with a real dilemma.
											How were we to do it?
											We&#39;d had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists
											bunching and moving their animals,
											but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.
											Then we&#39;d had 100 years of modern rain science,
											and that had accelerated desertification,
											as we first discovered in Africa
											and then confirmed in the United States,
											and as you see in this picture
											of land managed by the federal government.
											Clearly more was needed
											than bunching and moving the animals,
											and humans, over thousands of years,
											had never been able to deal with nature&#39;s complexity.
											But we biologists and ecologists
											had never tackled anything as complex as this.
											So rather than reinvent the wheel,
											I began studying other professions to see if anybody had.
											And I found there were planning techniques
											that I could take and adapt to our biological need,
											and from those I developed what we call
											holistic management and planned grazing,
											a planning process,
											and that does address all of nature&#39;s complexity
											and our social, environmental, economic complexity.

											Let&#39;s look at some results.
											This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.
											It has just come through four months of very good rains
											it got that year, and it&#39;s going into the long dry season.
											But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,
											has evaporated from the soil surface.
											Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended,
											and we have 150,000 people
											on almost permanent food aid.
											Now let&#39;s go to our land nearby on the same day,
											with the same rainfall, and look at that.
											Our river is flowing and healthy and clean.
											It&#39;s fine.
											The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,
											everything is now more productive,
											and we have virtually no fear of dry years.
											And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats
											400 percent,
											planning the grazing to mimic nature
											and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,
											giraffe and other animals that we have.
											But before we began, our land looked like that.
											This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years
											regardless of what rain we got.
											Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change
											as we use livestock to mimic nature.
											This was another site
											where it had been bare and eroding,
											and at the base of the marked small tree,
											we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?
											And again, watch the change
											just using livestock to mimic nature.
											And there are fallen trees in there now,
											because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.
											This land in Mexico was in terrible condition,
											and I&#39;ve had to mark the hill
											because the change is so profound.

											and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed
											is during mine reclamation,

											But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,

											in a hundred-mile drive,
