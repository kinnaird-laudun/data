											The oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet.
											And I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right
											when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet
											Planet Ocean.
											And the oceans are hugely productive,
											as you can see by the satellite image
											of photosynthesis, the production of new life.
											In fact, the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth
											as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe.
											In addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth,
											and much of it we don&#39;t know about.
											But I&#39;ll tell you some of that today.
											That also doesn&#39;t even get into the whole protein extraction
											that we do from the ocean.
											That&#39;s about 10 percent of our global needs
											and 100 percent of some island nations.

											If you were to descend
											into the 95 percent of the biosphere that&#39;s livable,
											it would quickly become pitch black,
											interrupted only by pinpoints of light
											from bioluminescent organisms.
											And if you turn the lights on,
											you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by,
											because those are the denizens of the deep,
											the things that live in the deep ocean.
											And eventually, the deep sea floor would come into view.
											This type of habitat covers more of the Earth&#39;s surface
											than all other habitats combined.
											And yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars
											than we do about this habitat,
											despite the fact that we have yet to extract
											a gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water
											from those bodies.

											And so 10 years ago,
											an international program began called the Census of Marine Life,
											which set out to try and improve our understanding
											of life in the global oceans.
											It involved 17 different projects around the world.
											As you can see, these are the footprints of the different projects.
											And I hope you&#39;ll appreciate the level of global coverage
											that it managed to achieve.
											It all began when two scientists, Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel,
											met in Woods Hole, Massachusetts
											where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute.
											And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity
											and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it.
											Well, from that discussion grew this program
											that involved 2,700 scientists
											from more than 80 countries around the world
											who engaged in 540 ocean expeditions
											at a combined cost of 650 million dollars
											to study the distribution, diversity and abundance
											of life in the global ocean.

									<p>
											And so what did we find?
											We found spectacular new species,
											the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked —
											from the shoreline to the abyss,
											form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between.
											And the limiting step here wasn&#39;t the unknown diversity of life,
											but rather the taxonomic specialists
											who can identify and catalog these species
											that became the limiting step.
											They, in fact, are an endangered species themselves.
											There are actually four to five new species
											described everyday for the oceans.
											And as I say, it could be a much larger number.

											Now, I come from Newfoundland in Canada —
											It&#39;s an island off the east coast of that continent —
											where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters
											in human history.
											And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish.
											It&#39;s around 1900.
											Now, when I was a boy of about his age,
											I would go out fishing with my grandfather
											and we would catch fish about half that size.
											And I thought that was the norm,
											because I had never seen fish like this.
											If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed,
											if you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge,
											it would be half that size still.
											So what we&#39;re experiencing is something called shifting baselines.
											Our expectations of what the oceans can produce
											is something that we don&#39;t really appreciate
											because we haven&#39;t seen it in our lifetimes.

											Now most of us, and I would say me included,
											think that human exploitation of the oceans
											really only became very serious
											in the last 50 to, perhaps, 100 years or so.
											The census actually tried to look back in time,
											using every source of information they could get their hands on.
											And so anything from restaurant menus
											to monastery records to ships&#39; logs
											to see what the oceans looked like.
											Because science data really goes back
											to, at best, World War II, for the most part.
											And so what they found, in fact,
											is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans.
											And so at that time, of course, there was no refrigeration.
											So fishermen could only catch
											what they could either eat or sell that day.
											But the Romans developed salting.
											And with salting,
											it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances.
											And so began industrial fishing.

									<p>
											And so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have
											of what sort of loss we&#39;ve had
											relative to pre-human impacts on the ocean.
											They range from 65 to 98 percent
											for these major groups of organisms,
											as shown in the dark blue bars.
											Now for those species the we managed to leave alone, that we protect —
											for example, marine mammals in recent years and sea birds —
											there is some recovery.
											So it&#39;s not all hopeless.
											But for the most part, we&#39;ve gone from salting to exhausting.

											Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.
											It&#39;s from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida.
											And so this is a photograph from the 1950s.
											I want you to notice the scale on the slide,
											because when you see the same picture from the 1980s,
											we see the fish are much smaller
											and we&#39;re also seeing a change
											in terms of the composition of those fish.
											By 2007, the catch was actually laughable
											in terms of the size for a trophy fish.
											But this is no laughing matter.
											The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity
											and we&#39;re responsible for it.

											So what&#39;s left? Actually quite a lot.
											There&#39;s a lot of exciting things, and I&#39;m going to tell you a little bit about them.
											And I want to start with a bit on technology,
											because, of course, this is a TED Conference
											and you want to hear something on technology.
											So one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean
											are remotely operated vehicles.
											So these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor
											where they&#39;re our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom.
											So a couple of years ago, I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise
											and I couldn&#39;t go because of a scheduling conflict.
											But through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home
											with my dog curled up at my feet, a cup of tea in my hand,
											and I could tell the pilot, &quot;I want a sample right there.&quot;
											And that&#39;s exactly what the pilot did for me.
											That&#39;s the sort of technology that&#39;s available today
											that really wasn&#39;t available even a decade ago.
											So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats
											that are very far from the surface
											and very far from light.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans
											is acoustics, or sound waves.
											And the advantage of sound waves
											is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light.
											And so we can send out sound waves,
											they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back.
											And so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships.
											One would send out sound waves that would bounce back.
											They would be received by a second ship,
											and that would give us very precise estimates, in this case,
											of 250 billion herring
											in a period of about a minute.
											And that&#39;s an area about the size of Manhattan Island.
											And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool,
											because knowing how many fish are there is really critical.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We can also use satellite tags
											to track animals as they move through the oceans.
											And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe,
											such as this elephant seal,
											it&#39;s an opportunity to send data back to shore
											and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean.
											And so from that we can produce these tracks.
											For example, the dark blue
											shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific.
											Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind, this slide is not very helpful,
											but stick with me nonetheless.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											For animals that don&#39;t surface,
											we have something called pop-up tags,
											which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets.
											And then at some period of time
											it pops up to the surface and, again, relays that data back to shore.
											Because GPS doesn&#39;t work under water. That&#39;s why we need these tools.
											And so from this we&#39;re able to identify these blue highways,
											these hot spots in the ocean,
											that should be real priority areas
											for ocean conservation.

											Now one of the other things that you may think about
											is that, when you go to the supermarket and you buy things, they&#39;re scanned.
											And so there&#39;s a barcode on that product
											that tells the computer exactly what the product is.
											Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding.
											And what barcoding does
											is use a specific gene called CO1
											that&#39;s consistent within a species, but varies among species.
											And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify
											which species are which
											even if they look similar to each other,
											but may be biologically quite different.

											Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this
											is the story of two young women, high school students in New York City,
											who worked with the census.
											They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City
											and they barcoded it.
											Well what they found was mislabeled fish.
											So for example,
											they found something which was sold as tuna, which is very valuable,
											was in fact tilapia, which is a much less valuable fish.
											They also found an endangered species
											sold as a common one.
											So barcoding allows us to know what we&#39;re working with
											and also what we&#39;re eating.

											The Ocean Biogeographic Information System
											is the database for all the census data.
											It&#39;s open access; you can all go in and download data as you wish.
											And it contains all the data from the census
											plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute.
											And so what you can do with that
											is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans.
											What I&#39;ve plotted up here is the data that we have on hand.
											This is where our sampling effort has concentrated.
											Now what you can see
											is we&#39;ve sampled the area in the North Atlantic,
											in the North Sea in particular,
											and also the east coast of North America fairly well.
											That&#39;s the warm colors which show a well-sampled region.
											The cold colors, the blue and the black,
											show areas where we have almost no data.
											So even after a 10-year census,
											there are large areas that still remain unexplored.

											Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico
											who decided really as a labor of love
											to pull together all the knowledge they could
											about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico.
											And so they put this together, a list of all the species,
											where they&#39;re known to occur,
											and it really seemed like a very esoteric, scientific type of exercise.
											But then, of course, there was the Deep Horizon oil spill.
											So all of a sudden, this labor of love
											for no obvious economic reason
											has become a critical piece of information
											in terms of how that system is going to recover, how long it will take
											and how the lawsuits
											and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years

											So what did we find?
											Well, I could stand here for hours, but, of course, I&#39;m not allowed to do that.
											But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries
											from the census.
											So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity?
											Where do we find the most species of ocean life?
											And what we find if we plot up the well-known species
											is this sort of a distribution.
											And what we see is that for coastal tags,
											for those organisms that live near the shoreline,
											they&#39;re most diverse in the tropics.
											This is something we&#39;ve actually known for a while,
											so it&#39;s not a real breakthrough.

									<p>
											What is really exciting though
											is that the oceanic tags, or the ones that live far from the coast,
											are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes.
											This is the sort of data, again, that managers could use
											if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve.
											You can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale.
											And that&#39;s why biodiversity data can be so valuable.

											Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census
											are things that are small and hard to see,
											that certainly wasn&#39;t always the case.
											For example, while it&#39;s hard to believe
											that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists,
											it did until a few years ago
											when South African fishermen requested an export permit
											and scientists realized that this was something new to science.
											Similarly this Golden V kelp
											collected in Alaska just below the low water mark
											is probably a new species.
											Even though it&#39;s three meters long,
											it actually, again, eluded science.
											Now this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length.
											But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,
											so it was a lot harder to find.
											But there&#39;s still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.
											This particular shrimp, we&#39;ve dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp,
											it&#39;s thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago —
											at least it was, until the census discovered
											it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia.
											And it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness,
											can hide secrets for a very long time.
											So, Steven Spielberg, eat your heart out.

											If we look at distributions, in fact distributions change dramatically.
											And so one of the records that we had
											was this sooty shearwater, which undergoes these spectacular migrations
											all the way from New Zealand
											all the way up to Alaska and back again
											in search of endless summer
											as they complete their life cycles.
											We also talked about the White Shark Cafe.
											This is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge.

											One of the things that we&#39;re taught in high school
											is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.
											Now this little critter, it&#39;s only about half a millimeter in size,
											not terribly charismatic.
											But it was only discovered in the early 1980s.
											But the really interesting thing about it
											is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered
											that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments
											in the deep Mediterranean Sea.
											So now they know that, in fact,

											Now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles
											and not much biomass in between.

											Now in terms of the unknowns, there are many.
											And I&#39;m just going to summarize just a few of them
											very quickly for you.
											First of all, we might ask, how many fishes in the sea?
											We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean
											other than marine mammals.
											And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery
											how many more species we&#39;re likely to discover.
											And from that, we actually calculate
											that we know about 16,500 marine species
											and there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go.
											So we&#39;ve done pretty well.
											We&#39;ve got about 75 percent of the fish,
											maybe as much as 90 percent.
											But the fishes, as I say, are the best known.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms.
											Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper
											that&#39;s going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology.
											And what is does is predict how many more species there are
											on land and in the ocean.
											And what they found
											is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean.
											That means 91 percent, even after the census,
											still remain to be discovered.
											And so that turns out to be about two million species
											once all is said and done.
											So we still have quite a lot of work to do
											in terms of unknowns.

											Now this bacterium
											is part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile.
											And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece.
											And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye.
											But you can imagine the biomass that represents.
											But the really intriguing thing about the microbes
											is just how diverse they are.
											A single drop of seawater
											could contain 160 different types of microbes.
											And the oceans themselves
											are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types.
											So that&#39;s really exciting. What are they all doing out there?

											The most exciting thing, I would say, about this census
											is the role of global science.
											And so as we see in this image of light during the night,
											there are lots of areas of the Earth
											where human development is much greater
											and other areas where it&#39;s much less,
											but between them we see large dark areas
											of relatively unexplored ocean.
											The other point I&#39;d like to make about this
											is that this ocean&#39;s interconnected.
											Marine organisms do not care about international boundaries;
											they move where they will.
											And so the importance then of global collaboration
											becomes all the more important.

											We&#39;ve lost a lot of paradise.
											For example, these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea
											are now effectively gone.
											There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean,
											which collected more garbage than they did animals.
											And that&#39;s the deep sea, that&#39;s the environment that we consider to be
											among the most pristine left on Earth.
											And there are a lot of other pressures.
											Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with,
											as well as ocean warming, and the effects they&#39;re going to have on coral reefs.
											On the scale of decades, in our lifetimes,

											And I could spend the rest of my time, which is getting very limited,

											And so the grand challenge then
											is to try and make sure that we preserve what&#39;s left,
											because there is still spectacular beauty.
											And the oceans are so productive,
											there&#39;s so much going on in there that&#39;s of relevance to humans
											that we really need to, even from a selfish perspective,

(It had never really been done before.) Some 2,700 scientists from 80 countries, on 540 expeditions, worked to assess the diversity, distribution, and abundance of marine life. More than 6,000 potential new species were discovered, amid scenes of ocean degradation, resilience, and wonder. <br /><br />It was Paul Snelgrove&#39;s job to synthesize this mass of findings into a book. Snelgrove, a professor at Memorial University in Newfoundland who studies benthic sedimentary ecosystems, led the team that produced the book Discoveries of the Census of Marine Life, about the most important and dramatic findings of the CML: new species and habitats, unexpected and epic migration routes and changing distribution patterns. The census revealed how diverse, surprising, still vastly unknown, and tenacious life is in the oceans.</p><p>He says: &quot;How to distill thousands of scientific papers and dozens of books into a coherent story?
